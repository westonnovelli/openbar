{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "\u00a0...Before I get into the tips for how to study math let me first say that everyone studies differently and there is no one right way to study for a math class.\u00a0 There are a lot of tips in this document and there is a pretty good chance that you will not agree with all of them or find that you can\u2019t do all of them due to time constraints.\u00a0 There is nothing wrong with that.\u00a0 We all study differently and all that anyone can ask of us is that we do the best that we can.\u00a0 It is my intent with these tips to help you do the best that you can given the time that you\u2019ve got to work with....\u00a0...Now, I figure that there are two groups of people here reading this document, those that are happy with their grade, but are interested in what I\u2019ve got to say and those that are not happy with their grade and want some ideas on how to improve.\u00a0 Here are a couple of quick comments for each of these groups....\u00a0...If you have a study routine that you are happy with and you are getting the grade you want from your math class you may find this an interesting read.\u00a0 There is, of course, no reason to change your study habits if you\u2019ve been successful with them in the past.\u00a0 However, you might benefit from a comparison of your study habits to the tips presented here....\u00a0...If you are not happy with your grade in your math class and you are looking for ways to improve your grade there are a couple of general comments that I need to get out of the way before proceeding with the tips.\u00a0 Most people who are doing poorly in a math class fall into three main categories.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first category consists of the largest group of students and these are students that just do not have good study habits and/or don\u2019t really understand how to study for a math class.\u00a0 Students in this category should find these tips helpful and while you may not be able to follow all of them hopefully you will be able to follow enough of them to improve your study skills....\u00a0...The next category is the people who spend hours each day studying and still don\u2019t do well.\u00a0 Most of the people in this category suffer from inefficient study habits and hopefully this set of notes will help you to study more efficiently and not waste time.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The final category is those people who simply aren\u2019t spending enough time studying.\u00a0 Students are in this category for a variety of reasons.\u00a0 Some students have job and/or family commitments that prevent them from spending the time needed to be successful in a math class.\u00a0 To be honest there isn\u2019t a whole lot that I can do for you if that is your case other than hopefully you will become a more efficient in your studies after you are through reading this.\u00a0 The vast majority of the students in this category unfortunately, don\u2019t realize that they are in this category.\u00a0 Many don\u2019t realize how much time you need to spend on studying in order to be successful in a math class.\u00a0 Hopefully reading this document will help you to realize that you do need to study more.\u00a0 Many simply aren\u2019t willing to make the time to study as there are other things in their lives that are more important to them.\u00a0 While that is a decision that you will have to make, realize that eventually you will have to take the time if you want to pass your math course....\u00a0...Now, with all of that out of the way let\u2019s get into the tips.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried to break down the hints and advice here into specific areas such as general study tips, doing homework, studying for exams, ...\u00a0 However, there are three broad, general areas that all of these tips will fall into....\u00a0...You cannot learn mathematics by just going to class and watching the instructor lecture and work problems.\u00a0 In order to learn mathematics you must be actively involved in the learning process.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to attend class and pay attention while in class.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to take a good set of notes.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to work homework problems, even if the instructor doesn\u2019t assign any.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to study on a regular schedule, not just the night before exams.\u00a0 In other words you need to be involved in the learning process....\u00a0...The reality is that most people really need to work to pass a math class, and in general they need to work harder at math classes than they do with their other classes.\u00a0 If all that you\u2019re willing to do is spend a couple of hours studying before each exam then you will find that passing most math classes will be very difficult....\u00a0...If you aren\u2019t willing to be actively involved in the process of learning mathematics, both inside and outside of the class room, then you will have trouble passing any math class.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...You can pass a history class by simply memorizing a set of dates, names and events.\u00a0 You will find, however, that in order to pass a math class you will need to do more than just memorize a set of formulas.\u00a0 While there is certainly a fair amount of memorization of formulas in a math class you need to do more.\u00a0 You need to understand how to USE the formulas and that is often far different from just memorizing them....\u00a0...Some formulas have restrictions on them that you need to know in order to correctly use them.\u00a0 For instance, in order to use the quadratic formula you must have the quadratic in standard form first.\u00a0 You need to remember this or you will often get the wrong answer!...\u00a0...Other formulas are very general and require you to identify the parts in the problem that correspond to parts in the formula.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t understand how the formula works and the principle behind it, it can often be very difficult to use the formula.\u00a0 For example, in a calculus course it\u2019s not terribly difficult to memorize the formula for integration by parts for integrals.\u00a0 However, if you don\u2019t understand how to actually use the formula and identify the appropriate parts of the integral you will find the memorized formula worthless....\u00a0...You\u2019ve always got to remember that mathematics courses are cumulative.\u00a0 Almost everything you do in a math class will depend on subjects that you\u2019ve previously learned.\u00a0 This goes beyond just knowing the previous

You will need to understand them, how they work, and more importantly whether they can be used or not.\u00a0 As an example, the first topic we will look at is Integration by Parts.\u00a0 The integration by parts formula is very easy to remember.\u00a0 However, just because you\u2019ve got it memorized doesn\u2019t mean that you can use it.\u00a0 You\u2019ll need to be able to look at an integral and realize that integration by parts can be used (which isn\u2019t always obvious) and then decide which portions of the integral correspond to the parts in the formula (again, not always obvious)....\u00a0...Finally, many of the problems in this course will have multiple solution techniques and so you\u2019ll need to be able to identify all the possible techniques and then decide which will be the easiest technique to use....\u00a0...So, with all that out of the way let me also get a couple of warnings out of the way to my students who may be here to get a copy of what

integral will NOT use this formula so don\u2019t try to....\u00a0...\u00a0...This one is really the same issue as the previous one, but so many students have trouble with logarithms that I wanted to treat that example separately to make the point....\u00a0...So, as with the previous issue students tend to try and use \u201csimple\u201d formulas that they know to be true on integrals that, on the surface, kind of look the same.\u00a0 So, for instance we\u2019ve got the following two formulas,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The mistake here is to assume that if these are true then the following must also be true....\u00a0...\u00a0...This just isn\u2019t true!\u00a0 The first set of formulas work because it is the square root of a single variable or a single variable squared.\u00a0 If there is anything other than a single u under the square root or being squared then those formulas are worthless.\u00a0 On occasion these will hold for things other than a single u, but in general they won\u2019t hold so be careful!...\u00a0...Here\u2019s another table with a couple of examples of these formulas not being used correctly....\u00a0...\u00a0...If you aren\u2019t convinced that the incorrect answers really aren\u2019t correct then remember that you can always check you answers to indefinite integrals by differentiating the answer.\u00a0 If you did everything correctly you should get the function you originally integrated, although in each case it will take some simplification to get the answers to be the same....\u00a0...Also, if you don\u2019t see how to get the correct answer for these they typically show up in a Calculus II class.\u00a0 The second however, you could do with only Calculus I under your belt if you can remember an appropriate trig formula....\u00a0...The remainder of the errors in this document consists mostly of notational errors that students tend to make.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...I\u2019ll start with limits.\u00a0 Students tend to get lazy and start dropping limit notation after the first step.\u00a0 For example, an incorrectly worked problem is...There are several things wrong with this.\u00a0 First, when you drop the limit symbol you are saying that you\u2019ve in fact taken the limit.\u00a0 So, in the first equality,...you are saying that the value of the limit is...and this is clearly not the case.\u00a0 Also, in the final equality,...you are making the claim that each side is the same, but this is only true provided\u00a0\u00a0 and what you really are trying to say is...\u00a0...You may know what you mean, but someone else will have a very hard time deciphering your work.\u00a0 Also, your instructor will not know what you mean by this and won\u2019t know if you understand that the limit symbols are required in every step until you actually take the limit.\u00a0 If you are one of my students, I won\u2019t even try to read your mind and I will assume that you didn\u2019t understand and take points off accordingly....\u00a0...So, while you may feel that it is silly and unnecessary to write limits down at every step it is proper notation and in my class I expect you to use proper notation.\u00a0 The correct way to work this limit is....The limit is required at every step until you actually take the limit, at which point the limit must be dropped as I have done above....\u00a0...\u00a0...When asked to differentiate ...\u00a0I will get the following for an answer on occasion....\u00a0...This is again a situation where you may know what you\u2019re intending to say here, but anyone else who reads this will come away with the idea that ...\u00a0and that is clearly NOT what you are trying to say.\u00a0 However, it IS what you are saying when you write it this way....\u00a0...The proper notation is...\u00a0...\u00a0...There are many dropped notation errors that occur with integrals.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with this example....\u00a0...\u00a0...As with the derivative example above, both of these equalities are incorrect.\u00a0 The minute you drop the integral sign you are saying that you\u2019ve done the integral!\u00a0 So, this means that the first equality is saying that the value of the integral is ..., when in reality all you\u2019re doing is simplifying the function.\u00a0 Likewise, the last equality says that the two functions, ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are equal, when they are not!\u00a0 Here is the correct way to work this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...Another big problem in dropped notation is students dropping the ... at the end of the integrals.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The problem with this is that the ... tells us where the integral stops!\u00a0 So, this can mean a couple of different things....\u00a0...Without the dx a reader is left to try and intuit where exactly the integral ends!\u00a0 The best way to think of this is that parenthesis always come in pairs \u201c(\u201d and \u201c)\u201d.\u00a0 You don\u2019t open a set of parenthesis without closing it.\u00a0 Likewise, ...\u00a0is always paired up with a ....\u00a0 You can always think of ...\u00a0as the opening parenthesis and the ... as the closing parenthesis....\u00a0...Another dropped notation error that I see on a regular basis is with definite integrals.\u00a0 Students tend to drop the limits of integration after the first step and do the rest of the problem with ... limits of integration as follows....\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, the first equality here just doesn\u2019t make sense!\u00a0 The answer to a definite integral is a number, while the answer to an indefinite integral is a function.\u00a0 When written as above you are saying the answer to the definite integral and the answer to the indefinite integral are the same when they clearly aren\u2019t!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Likewise, the second to last equality just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u00a0 Here you are saying that the function, ...\u00a0is equal to ...\u00a0and again, this just isn\u2019t true!\u00a0 Here is the correct way to work this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...The previous three topics that I\u2019ve discussed have all been examples of dropped notation errors that students first learning calculus tend to make on a regular basis.\u00a0 Be careful with these kinds of errors.\u00a0 You may know what you\u2019re trying to say, but improper notation may imply something totally different.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Remember that in many ways written mathematics is like a language.\u00a0 If you mean to say to someone...\u00a0...\u201cI\u2019m thirsty, could you please get me a glass of water to drink.\u201d...\u00a0...You wouldn\u2019t drop words that you considered extraneous to the message and just say...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u201cThirsty, drink\u201d...\u00a0...This is meaningless and the person that you were talking to may get the idea that you are thirsty and wanted to drink something.\u00a0\u00a0 They would definitely not get the idea that you wanted water to drink or that you were asking them to get it for you.\u00a0 You would know that is what you wanted, but those two words would not convey that to anyone else....\u00a0...This may seem like a silly example to you, because you would never do something like this.\u00a0 You would give the whole sentence and not just two words because you are fully aware of how confusing simply saying those two words would be.\u00a0 That, however, is exactly the point of the example.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...You know better than to skip important words in spoken language, so you shouldn\u2019t skip important notation (i.e. words) in writing down the language of mathematics.\u00a0 You may feel that they aren\u2019t important parts to the message, but they are.\u00a0 Anyone else reading the message you wrote down would not necessarily know that you neglected to write down those important pieces of notation and would very likely misread the message you were trying to impart....\u00a0...So, be careful with proper notation.\u00a0 In my class, I grade the \u201cmessage\u201d you write down not the \u201cmessage\u201d that you meant to impart.\u00a0 I can\u2019t read your mind so I don\u2019t even try to.\u00a0 If the \u201cmessage\u201d that I read in grading your homework or exam is wrong, I will grade it appropriately....\u00a0...\u00a0...Dropping the constant of integration on indefinite integrals (the + ... part) is one of the biggest errors that students make in integration.\u00a0 There are actually two errors here that students make.\u00a0 Some students just don\u2019t put it in at all, and others drop it from intermediate steps and then just tack it onto the final answer....\u00a0...Those that don\u2019t include it at all tend to be the students that don\u2019t remember (or never really understood) that the indefinite integrals give the most general possible function that we could differentiate to get the integrand (the function we integrated).\u00a0 Because it is the most general possible function we\u2019ve got to include the constant, since constants differentiate to zero....\u00a0...For those that drop it from all intermediate steps and just tack it on at the end there are other issues.\u00a0\u00a0 I suppose that the problem is these (in fact it\u2019s probably most) students just don\u2019t see why it\u2019s important to include the constant of integration.\u00a0 This is partially a problem with the class itself.\u00a0 Calculus classes just don\u2019t really have good examples of why the constant of integration is so important or how it comes into play in later steps....\u00a0...The first place where constants of integration play a major role is a first course in differential equations.\u00a0 Here the constant of integration will show up in the middle of the problem.\u00a0 If it\u2019s dropped there and then just added back in on the final answer or not put in at all, the answer will be very wrong.\u00a0 The answer won\u2019t be wrong because the instructor said that it was wrong without the constant or because it was only added in at the last step.\u00a0 The answer will be wrong because the function you get without dropping it will be totally different from the function you get if you do drop it!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is not so much about an actual error that students make, but instead a misconception that can, on occasion, lead to errors.\u00a0 This is also a misconception that is often encouraged by laziness on the part of the instructor. ...\u00a0...So, just what is this misconception?\u00a0 Often, we will write ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The problem is that neither of these are technically correct and in fact the second, depending on the situation, can actually be ....\u00a0 All three of these are really limits and we just short hand them.\u00a0 What we really should write is...\u00a0...\u00a0...In the first case 1 over something increasingly large is increasingly small and so ... we get zero.\u00a0 In the last two cases note that we\u2019ve got to use one-sided limits as ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t even exist!\u00a0 In these two cases, 1 over something increasingly small is increasingly large and will have the sign of the denominator and so in the limit it goes to either ...\u00a0or .......\u00a0...\u00a0...This is actually a generalization of the previous topic.\u00a0 The two operations above, ...\u00a0\u00a0and ...\u00a0are called ... because there is no one single value for them.\u00a0 Depending on the situation they have a very wide range of possible answers....\u00a0...There are many more indeterminate forms that you need to look out for.\u00a0 As with the previous discussion there is no way to determine their value without taking the situation into consideration.\u00a0 Here are a few of the more common indeterminate forms....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s just take a brief look at ...\u00a0to see the potential problems.\u00a0 Here we really have two separate rules that are at odds with each other.\u00a0 Typically we have ...(provided ... is positive) and ....\u00a0 Each of these rules implies that we could get different answers.\u00a0 Depending on the situation we could get either 0 or 1 as an answer here.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s also possible to get something totally different from 0 or 1 as an answer here as well....\u00a0...All the others listed here have similar problems.\u00a0 So, when dealing with indeterminate forms you need to be careful and not jump to conclusions about the value.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...In the following discussion I\u2019m going to be working exclusively with real numbers (things can be different with say complex numbers).\u00a0 I\u2019m also going to think of infinity (...) as a really, really large number.\u00a0 This is not technically accurate as infinity is really a concept to denote a state of endlessness or a state of no limits in any direction.\u00a0 In terms of a number line infinity (...) denotes moving in the positive direction without ever stopping.\u00a0 Likewise, negative infinity (...) on a number line denotes moving in the negative direction without ever stopping.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The problem with the conceptual definition of infinity is that many students have a hard time dealing with arithmetic involving infinity when they think if in it terms of its conceptual definition.\u00a0 However, if we simply call it a really, really large number it seems to help a little so that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to think of it for the purposes of this discussion....\u00a0...Most students have run across infinity at some point in time prior to a calculus class.\u00a0 However, when they have dealt with it, it was just a symbol used to represent a really, really large positive or negative number and that was the extent of it.\u00a0 Once they get into a calculus class students are asked to do some basic algebra with infinity and this is where they get into trouble.\u00a0 Infinity is NOT a number and for the most part doesn\u2019t behave like a number.\u00a0 When you add two non-zero numbers you get a new number.\u00a0 For example, ....\u00a0 With infinity this is not true.\u00a0 With infinity you have the following....\u00a0...In other words, a really, really large positive number (...) plus any positive number, regardless of the size, is still a really, really large positive number.\u00a0 Likewise, you can add a negative number (... ...) to a really, really large positive number and stay really, really large and positive.\u00a0 So, addition involving infinity can be dealt with in an intuitive way if you\u2019re careful.\u00a0 Note as well that the ... must NOT be negative infinity.\u00a0 If it is, there are some serious issues that we need to deal with....\u00a0...Subtraction with negative infinity can also be dealt with in an intuitive way.\u00a0 A really, really large negative number minus any positive number, regardless of its size, is still a really, really large negative number.\u00a0 Subtracting a negative number (i.e. ...)\u00a0 from a really, really large negative number will still be a really, really large negative number.\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...Again, ... must not be negative infinity to avoid some potentially serious difficulties....\u00a0...Multiplication can also be dealt with fairly intuitively.\u00a0 A really, really large number (positive, or negative) times any number, regardless of size, is still a really, really large number.\u00a0 In the case of multiplication we have...\u00a0...What you know about products of positive and negative numbers is still true....\u00a0...Some forms of division can be dealt with intuitively as well.\u00a0 A really, really large number divided by a number that isn\u2019t too large is still a really, really large number....\u00a0...Division of a number by infinity is somewhat intuitive, but there are a couple of subtleties that you need to be aware of.\u00a0\u00a0 I go into this in more detail in the section about ...\u00a0above, but one way to think of it is the following.\u00a0 A number that isn\u2019t too large divided by infinity (a really, really large number) is a very, very, very small number.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...So, I\u2019ve dealt with almost every basic algebraic operation involving infinity.\u00a0 There are two cases that that I haven\u2019t dealt with yet.\u00a0 These are...\u00a0...The problem with these two is that intuition doesn\u2019t really help here.\u00a0 A really, really large number minus a really, really large number can be anything (..., a constant, or ...).\u00a0 Likewise, a really, really large number divided by a really, really large number can also be anything (... - this depends on sign issues, 0, or a non-zero constant).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...What you\u2019ve got to remember here is that there are really, really large numbers and then there are really, really, really large numbers.\u00a0 In other words, some infinities are larger than other infinities.\u00a0 With addition, multiplication and the first sets of division I worked this isn\u2019t an issue.\u00a0 The general size of the infinity just doesn\u2019t affect the answer.\u00a0 However, with the subtraction and division I listed above, it does matter as you will see....\u00a0...Here is one way to think of this idea that some infinities are larger than others.\u00a0 This is a fairly dry and technical way to think of this and your calculus problems will probably never use this stuff, but this it is a nice way of looking at this.\u00a0 Also, please note that I\u2019m not trying to give a precise proof of anything here.\u00a0 I\u2019m just trying to give you a little insight into the problems with infinity and how some infinities can be thought of as larger than others.\u00a0 For a much better (and definitely more precise) discussion see,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start by looking at how many integers there are.\u00a0 Clearly, I hope, there are an infinite number of them, but let\u2019s try to get a better grasp on the \u201csize\u201d of this infinity.\u00a0 So, pick any two integers completely at random.\u00a0 Start at the smaller of the two and list, in increasing order, all the integers that come after that.\u00a0 Eventually we will reach the larger of the two integers that you picked.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Depending on the relative size of the two integers it might take a very, very long time to list all the integers between them and there isn\u2019t really a purpose to doing it. But, it could be done if we wanted to and that\u2019s the important part.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Because we could list all these integers between two randomly chosen integers we say that the integers are ....\u00a0 Again, there is no real reason to actually do this, it is simply something that can be done if we should chose to do so....\u00a0...In general a set of numbers is called countably infinite if we can find a way to list them all out.\u00a0 In a more precise mathematical setting this is generally done with a special kind of function called a ... that associates each number in the set with exactly one of the positive integers.\u00a0 To see some more details of this see the pdf given above....\u00a0...It can also be shown that the set of all fractions are also countably infinite, although this is a little harder to show and is not really the purpose of this discussion.\u00a0 To see a proof of this see the pdf given above.\u00a0 It has a very nice proof of this fact....\u00a0...Let\u2019s contrast this by trying to figure out how many numbers there are in the interval (0,1).\u00a0 By numbers, I mean all possible fractions that lie between zero and one as well as all possible decimals (that aren\u2019t fractions) that lie between zero and one.\u00a0 The following is similar to the proof given in the pdf above, but was nice enough and easy enough (I hope) that I wanted to include it here....\u00a0...To start let\u2019s assume that all the numbers in the interval (0,1) are countably infinite.\u00a0 This means that there should be a way to list all of them out.\u00a0 We could have something like the following,...\u00a0...Now, select the ...\u00a0 decimal out of\u00a0 ...\u00a0as shown below...and form a new number with these digits.\u00a0 So, for our example we would have the number...\u00a0...In this new decimal replace all the 3\u2019s with a 1 and then replace every other number with a 3.\u00a0 In the case of our example this would yield the new number...\u00a0...Notice that this number is in the interval (0,1) and also notice that given how we choose the digits of the number this number will not be equal to the first number in our list, ..., because the first digit of each is guaranteed to not be the same.\u00a0 Likewise, this new number will not get the same number as the second in our list, ..., because the second digit of each is guaranteed to not be the same.\u00a0 Continuing in this manner we can see that this new number we constructed, ..., is guaranteed to not be in our listing.\u00a0 But this contradicts the initial assumption that we could list out all the numbers in the interval (0,1).\u00a0 Hence, it must not be possible to list out all the numbers in the interval (0,1)....\u00a0...Sets of numbers, such as all the numbers in (0,1), that\u00a0 we can\u2019t write down in a list are called .... ...\u00a0...The reason for going over this is the following.\u00a0 An infinity that is uncountably infinite is significantly larger than an infinity that is only countably infinite.\u00a0 So, if we take the difference of two infinities we have a couple of possibilities. ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that we didn\u2019t put down a difference of two infinities of the same type.\u00a0 Depending upon the context there might still have some ambiguity about just what the answer would be in this case, but that is a whole different topic...We could also do something similar for quotients of infinities....\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, we avoided a quotient of two infinities of the same type since, again depending upon the context, there might still be ambiguities about its value.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/CommonErrors/CalculusErrors.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Common Math Errors - Calculus Errors", "subject": "math"}},

and then determine where the other side is zero....So, once we move everything over to the left side and factor we can see that the left side will be zero at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 These numbers are NOT solutions (since we only looking for values that will make the equation positive) but are useful to finding the actual solution....\u00a0...To find the solution to this inequality we need to recall that polynomials are nice smooth functions that have no breaks in them.\u00a0 This means that as we are moving across the number line (in any direction) if the value of the polynomial changes sign (say from positive to negative) then it MUST go through zero! ...\u00a0...So, that means that these two numbers ( ...\u00a0and ...) are the ONLY places where the polynomial can change sign.\u00a0 The number line is then divided into three regions.\u00a0 In each region if the inequality is satisfied by one point from that region then it is satisfied for ALL points in that region.\u00a0 If this wasn\u2019t true (... it was positive at one point in region and negative at another) then it must also be zero somewhere in that region, but that can\u2019t happen as we\u2019ve already determined all the places where the polynomial can be zero!\u00a0 Likewise, if the inequality isn\u2019t satisfied for some point in that region that it isn\u2019t satisfied for ANY point in that region....\u00a0...This means that all we need to do is pick a test point from each region (that are easy to work with, ... small integers if possible) and plug it into the inequality.\u00a0 If the test point satisfies the inequality then every point in that region does and if the test point doesn\u2019t satisfy the inequality then no point in that region does.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...One final note here about this.\u00a0 I\u2019ve got three versions of the inequality above.\u00a0 You can plug the test point into any of them, but it\u2019s usually easiest to plug the test points into the factored form of the inequality.\u00a0 So, if you trust your factoring capabilities that\u2019s the one to use.\u00a0 However, if you HAVE made a mistake in factoring, then you may end up with the incorrect solution if you use the factored form for testing.\u00a0 It\u2019s a trade-off.\u00a0 The factored form is, in many cases, easier to work with, but if you\u2019ve made a mistake in factoring you may get the incorrect solution....\u00a0...So, here\u2019s the number line and tests that I used for this problem....From this we see that the solution to this inequality is ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 In interval notation this would be ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 You\u2019ll notice that the endpoints were not included in the solution for this.\u00a0 Pay attention to the original inequality when writing down the answer for these.\u00a0 Since the inequality was a strict inequality, we don\u2019t include the endpoints since these are the points that make both sides of the inequality equal!...\u00a0...2. ...We\u2019ll do the same with this problem as the last problem....In this case after factoring we can see that the left side will be zero at ..., ...\u00a0and .......From this number line the solution to the inequality is ...\u00a0or [-6,2].\u00a0 Do not get locked into the idea that the intervals will alternate as solutions as they did in the first problem.\u00a0 Also, notice that in this case the inequality was less than OR EQUAL TO, so we did include the endpoints in our solution....\u00a0...3. ...This one is a little different, but not really more difficult.\u00a0 The quadratic doesn\u2019t factor and so we\u2019ll need to use the quadratic formula to solve for where it is zero.\u00a0 Doing this gives...Reducing to decimals this is ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 From this point on it\u2019s identical to the previous two problems.\u00a0 In the number line below the dashed lines are at the approximate values of the two numbers above and the inequalities show the value of the quadratic evaluated at the test points shown....From the number line above we see that the solution is ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...4. \u00a0...The process for solving inequalities that involve rational functions is nearly identical to solving inequalities that involve polynomials.\u00a0 Just like polynomial inequalities, rational inequalities can change sign where the rational expression is zero.\u00a0 However, they can also change sign at any point that produces a division by zero error in the rational expression.\u00a0 A good example of this is the rational expression ....\u00a0 Clearly, there is division by zero at ...\u00a0and to the right of ...the expression is positive and to the left of ...the expression is negative....\u00a0...It\u2019s also important to note that a rational expression will only be zero for values of ... that make the numerator zero.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, what we need to do is first get a zero on one side of the inequality so we can use the above information.\u00a0 For this problem that has already been done.\u00a0 Now, determine where the numerator is zero (since the whole expression will be zero there) and where the denominator is zero (since we will get division by zero there)....\u00a0...At this point the process is identical to polynomial inequalities with one exception when we go to write down the answer.\u00a0 The points found above will divide the number line into regions in which the inequality will either always be true or always be false.\u00a0 So, pick test points from each region, test them in the inequality and get the solution from the results....\u00a0...For this problem the numerator will be zero at ...\u00a0and the denominator will be zero at ....\u00a0 The number line, along with the tests is shown below....So, from this number line it looks like the two outer regions will satisfy the inequality.\u00a0 We need to be careful with the endpoints however.\u00a0 We will include ...\u00a0because this will make the rational expression zero and so will be part of the solution.\u00a0 On the other hand, ...\u00a0will give division by zero and so MUST be excluded from the solution since division by zero is never allowed....\u00a0...The solution to this inequality is ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0OR ...and ..., depending on if you want inequality for the solution or intervals for the solution....\u00a0...5. ...We already have a zero on one side of the inequality so first factor the numerator so we can get the points where the numerator will be zero....So, the numerator will be zero at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The denominator will be zero at ....\u00a0 The number line for this inequality is below....In this case we won\u2019t include any endpoints in the solution since they either give division by zero or make the expression zero and we want strictly less than zero for this problem....\u00a0...The solution is then ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...6. ...We need to be a little careful with this one. In this case we need to get zero on one side of the inequality.\u00a0 This is easy enough to do.\u00a0 All we need to do is subtract 3 from both sides.\u00a0 This gives...Notice that I also combined everything into a single rational expression.\u00a0 You will always want to do this.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t do this it can be difficult to determine where the rational expression is zero.\u00a0 So once we\u2019ve gotten it into a single expression it\u2019s easy to see that the numerator will be zero at ...\u00a0and the denominator will be zero at ....\u00a0 The number line for this problem is below....\u00a0...The solution in this case is ....\u00a0 We don\u2019t include the -1 because this is where the solution is zero, but we do include the -3 because this makes the expression zero....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/AlgebraTrigReview/SolveIneq.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra/Trig Review - Solving Inequalities", "subject": "math"}},

Now, again using some geometry, this tells us that the angle in the third quadrant will be ...\u00a0below the ... ...-axis or ....\u00a0 Likewise, the angle in the fourth quadrant will ...\u00a0below the ... ...-axis or ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now we come to the very important difference between this problem and Problem 1.\u00a0 The solution is ... ...This is not the set of solutions because we are NOT looking for values of ... for which ..., but instead we are looking for values of ... for which ....\u00a0 Note the difference in the arguments of the sine function!\u00a0 One is ... and the other is ....\u00a0 This makes all the difference in the world in finding the solution!

the left hand sides between this solution and the corresponding solution in the previous problem....\u00a0...Now we need to solve for ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll first subtract 4 from both sides then divide by 5 to get the following solution....It\u2019s somewhat messy, but it is the solution.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get excited when solutions get messy.\u00a0 They will on occasion and you need to get used to seeing them....\u00a0...5. ...\u00a0on ...I\u2019m going to leave most of the explanation that was in the previous three out of this one to see if you have caught on how to do these....\u00a0...By examining a unit circle we see that...Now, we are looking for solutions in the range ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s start trying some values of .......\u00a0...Once, we\u2019ve hit the limit in one direction there\u2019s no reason to continue on.\u00a0 In, other words if using ...\u00a0gets values larger than ...\u00a0then so will all values of ... larger than 2.\u00a0 Note as well that it is possible to have one of these be a solution and the other to not be a solution.\u00a0 It all depends on the interval being used....\u00a0...Let\u2019s not forget the negative values of .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, now that we\u2019ve started getting less than ...\u00a0all other values of ...\u00a0will also give values that are less than .......\u00a0...So putting all this together gives the following six solutions....Finally, note again that if we hadn\u2019t divided the ...by 3 the only solutions we would have gotten would be ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 We would have completely missed four of the solutions!...\u00a0...6. ...\u00a0on ...This one doesn\u2019t actually have a lot of work involved.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking for values of ... for which ....\u00a0 This is one of the few trig equations for which there is only a single angle in all of ...\u00a0which will work.\u00a0 So our solutions are...Or, by dividing by 4,...Since we want the solutions on ...\u00a0negative values of ... aren\u2019t needed for this problem.\u00a0 So, plugging in values of ... will give the following four solutions...\u00a0...\u00a0...7. ...This is a trick question that is designed to remind you of certain properties about sine and cosine.\u00a0 Recall that ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Therefore, since cosine will never be greater that 1 it definitely can\u2019t be 2.\u00a0 So ... to this equation!...\u00a0...8. ...This problem is a little different from the previous ones.\u00a0 First, we need to do some rearranging and simplification....So, solving ...\u00a0is the same as solving ....\u00a0\u00a0 At some level we didn\u2019t need to do this for this problem as all we\u2019re looking for is angles in which sine and cosine have the same value, but opposite signs.\u00a0 However, for other problems this won\u2019t be the case and we\u2019ll want to convert to tangent....\u00a0...Looking at our trusty unit circle it appears that the solutions will be,...Or, upon dividing by the 2 we get the solutions...No interval was given so we\u2019ll stop here....\u00a0...9. ...Again, we need to do a little work to get this equation into a form we can handle.\u00a0 The easiest way to do this one is to recall one of the trig formulas from the ... section (in particular...Problem 3)....At this point, proceed as we did in the previous problems.....Or, by dividing by 2,...Again, there is no interval so we stop here....\u00a0...10. ...This problem is very different from the previous problems.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If you divide both sides by a cosine you ... lose solutions!\u00a0 The best way to deal with this one is to \u201cfactor\u201d the equations as follows....So, solutions will be values of ... for which ...or,...In the first case we will have ...\u00a0at the following values....In the second case we will have ...\u00a0at the following values....Note that in this case we got a repeat answer.\u00a0 Sometimes this will happen and sometimes it won\u2019t so don\u2019t expect this to always happen.\u00a0 So, all together we get the following solutions,...As with the previous couple of problems this has no interval so we\u2019ll stop here.\u00a0 Notice as well that if we\u2019d divided out a cosine we would have lost half the solutions....\u00a0...11. ...This problem appears very difficult at first glance, but only the first step is different for the previous problems.\u00a0 First notice that...The solutions to this are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 So, why cover this?\u00a0 Well, if you think about it there is very little difference between this and the problem you are asked to do.\u00a0 First, we factor the equation...The solutions to this are ...The solutions to the first are...Or, upon dividing by 3,...The second has no solutions because cosine can\u2019t be less that -1.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get used to this.\u00a0 Often both will yield solutions!...\u00a0...Therefore, the solutions to this are (again no interval so we\u2019re done at this point)....\u00a0...12. ...This problem, in some ways, is VERY different from the previous problems and yet will work in essentially the same manner.\u00a0 To this point all the problems came down to a few \u201cbasic\u201d angles that most people know and/or have used on a regular basis.\u00a0 This problem won\u2019t, but the solution process is pretty much the same.\u00a0 First, get the sine on one side by itself....\u00a0...Now, at this point we know that we don\u2019t have one of the \u201cbasic\u201d angles since those all pretty much come down to having 0, 1, ..., ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0on the right side of the equal sign.\u00a0 So, in order to solve this we\u2019ll need to use our calculator.\u00a0 Every calculator is different, but most will have an inverse sine ( ...), inverse cosine ( ...) and inverse tangent ( ...) button on them these days.\u00a0 If you aren\u2019t familiar with inverse trig functions see the next ... in this review.\u00a0 Also, make sure that your calculator is set to do radians and not degrees for this problem....\u00a0...It is also very important to understand the answer that your calculator will give.\u00a0 First, note that I said answer (... a single answer) because that is all your calculator will ever give and we know from our work above that there are infinitely many answers.\u00a0 Next, when using your calculator to solve ..., ... using ..., we will get the following ranges for .......So, when using the inverse sine button on your calculator it will ONLY return answers in the first or fourth quadrant depending upon the sign of ....... ... ...Using our calculator in this problem yields,...Don\u2019t forget the 2 that is in the argument!\u00a0 We\u2019ll take care of that in a bit....\u00a0...Now, we know from our work above that if there is a solution in the first quadrant to this equation then there will also be a solution in the second quadrant and that it will be at an angle of 0.2013579 above the ...-axis as shown below....I didn\u2019t put in the ..., or cosine value, in the unit circle since it\u2019s not needed for the problem.\u00a0 I did however note that they will be the same value, except for the negative sign.\u00a0 The angle in the second quadrant will then be,...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s put all this together....Note that I added the ...\u00a0onto our angles as well since we know that will be needed in order to get all the solutions.\u00a0 The final step is to then divide both sides by the 2 in order to get all possible solutions.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The answers won\u2019t be as \u201cnice\u201d as the answers in the previous problems but there they are.\u00a0 Note as well that if we\u2019d been given an interval we could plug in values of ... to determine the solutions that actually fall in the interval that we\u2019re interested in....\u00a0...13. ...This problem is again very similar to previous problems and yet has some differences.\u00a0 First get the cosine on one side by itself....Now, let\u2019s take a quick look at a unit circle so we can see what angles we\u2019re after....I didn\u2019t put the ... values in since they aren\u2019t needed for this problem.\u00a0 Note however, that they will be the same except have opposite signs.\u00a0 Now, if this were a problem involving a \u201cbasic\u201d angle we\u2019d drop the \u201c-\u201d to determine the angle each of the lines above makes with the ...-axis and then use that to find the actual angles.\u00a0 However, in this case since we\u2019re using a calculator we\u2019ll get the angle in the second quadrant for free so we may as well jump straight to that one.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...However, prior to doing that let\u2019s acknowledge how the calculator will work when working with inverse cosines.\u00a0 If we\u2019re going to solve ..., using ..., then our calculator will give one answer in one of the following ranges, depending upon the sign of ....... ... ...\u00a0...So, using our calculator we get the following angle in the second quadrant....Now, we need to get the second angle that lies in the third quadrant.\u00a0 To find this angle note that the line in the second quadrant and the line in the third quadrant both make the same angle with the negative ...-axis.\u00a0 Since we know what the angle in the second quadrant is we can find the angle that this line makes with the negative ...-axis as follows,...\u00a0...This means that the angle in the third quadrant is,...\u00a0...Putting all this together gives,...\u00a0...Finally, we just need to multiply both sides by 5 to determine all possible solutions....\u00a0...14. ...We\u2019ll do this one much quicker than the previous two.\u00a0 First get the sine on one side by itself....\u00a0...From a unit circle we can see that the two angles we\u2019ll be looking for are in the third and fourth quadrants.\u00a0 Our calculator will give us the angle that is in the fourth quadrant and this angle is,...\u00a0...Note that in all the previous examples we generally wouldn\u2019t have used this answer because it is negative.\u00a0 There is nothing wrong with the answer, but as I mentioned several times in earlier problems we generally try to use positive angles between 0 and ....\u00a0 However, in this case since we are doing calculator work we won\u2019t worry about that fact that it\u2019s negative.\u00a0 If we wanted the positive angle we could always get it as,... Now, the line corresponding to this solution makes an angle with the positive ...-axis of 0.775395.\u00a0 The angle in the third quadrant will be 0.775395 radians below the negative ...-axis and so is,...\u00a0...Putting all this together gives,...\u00a0...To get the final solution all we need to do is add 2 to both sides.\u00a0 All possible solutions are then,...\u00a0...As the last three examples have shown, solving a trig equation that doesn\u2019t give any of the \u201cbasic\u201d angles is not much different from those that do give \u201cbasic\u201d angles.\u00a0 In fact, in some ways there are a little easier to do since our calculator will always give us one for free and all we need to do is find the second.\u00a0 The main idea here is to always remember that we need to be careful with our calculator and understand the results that it gives us....\u00a0...Note as well that even for those problems that have \u201cbasic\u201d angles as solutions we could have used a calculator as well.\u00a0 The only difference would have been that our answers would have been decimals instead of the exact answers we got....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/AlgebraTrigReview/SolveTrigEqn.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra/Trig Review - Solving Trig Equations", "subject": "math"}},

There really isn\u2019t a whole lot to this procedure.\u00a0 We called the first step in the process step 0, mostly because all of the functions that we\u2019re going to look at here are going to be continuous, but it is something that we do need to be careful with.\u00a0 This process will only work if we have a function that is continuous on the given interval.\u00a0 The most labor intensive step of this process is the second step (step 1) where we find the critical points.\u00a0 It is also important to note that all we want are the critical points that are in the interval.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s do some examples....\u00a0...Determine   the absolute extrema for the following function and interval....All we really need to do here is follow the procedure   given above.\u00a0 So, first notice that   this is a polynomial and so in continuous everywhere and in particular is   then continuous on the given interval....\u00a0...Now, we need to get the derivative so that we can find the   critical points of the function....\u00a0...It looks like we\u2019ll have two critical points, ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Note that we actually want something more   than just the critical points.\u00a0 We only   want the critical points of the function that lie in the interval in   question.\u00a0 Both of these do fall in the   interval as so we will use both of them.\u00a0   That may seem like a silly thing to mention at this point, but it is   often forgotten, usually when it becomes important, and so we will mention it   at every opportunity to make sure it\u2019s not forgotten....\u00a0...Now we evaluate the function at the critical points and   the end points of the interval....\u00a0...Absolute extrema are the largest and smallest the function   will ever be and these four points represent the only places in the interval   where the absolute extrema can occur.\u00a0   So, from this list we see that the absolute maximum of ... is 24 and it occurs at ...\u00a0(a critical point) and the absolute minimum   of ... is -28 which occurs at ...\u00a0(an endpoint)....\u00a0...In this example we saw that absolute extrema can and will occur at both endpoints and critical points.\u00a0 One of the biggest mistakes that students make with these problems is to forget to check the endpoints of the interval....\u00a0...Determine   the absolute extrema for the following function and interval....Note that this problem is almost identical to the first   problem.\u00a0 The only difference is the   interval that we\u2019re working on.\u00a0 This   small change will completely change our answer however.\u00a0 With this change we have excluded both of   the answers from the first example....\u00a0...The first step is to again find the critical points.\u00a0 From the first example we know these are ...\u00a0and .....\u00a0 At this point it\u2019s important to recall that   we only want the critical points that actually fall in the interval in   question.\u00a0 This means that we only want   ...\u00a0since ...\u00a0falls outside the interval....\u00a0...Now evaluate the function at the single critical point in   the interval and the two endpoints....\u00a0...From this list of values we see that the absolute maximum   is 8 and will occur at ...\u00a0and the absolute minimum is -3 which occurs   at .......\u00a0...As we saw in this example a simple change in the interval can completely change the answer.\u00a0 It also has shown us that we do need to be careful to exclude critical points that aren\u2019t in the interval.\u00a0 Had we forgotten this and included ...\u00a0we would have gotten the wrong absolute maximum!...\u00a0...This is the other big mistakes that students make in these problems.\u00a0 All too often they forget to exclude critical points that aren\u2019t in the interval.\u00a0 If your instructor is anything like me this will mean that you will get the wrong answer. \u00a0It\u2019s not too hard to make sure that a critical point outside of the interval is larger or smaller than any of the points in the interval....\u00a0...Suppose   that the population (in thousands) of a certain kind of insect

...Let\u2019s start with the derivative....\u00a0...We need the critical points of the function.\u00a0 The derivative exists everywhere so there   are no critical points from that.\u00a0 So,   all we need to do is determine where the derivative is zero....\u00a0...The solutions to this are,...\u00a0...So, these are all the critical points.\u00a0 We need to determine the ones that fall in   the interval [0,4].\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing to   do except plug some ...\u2019s into the   formulas until we get all of them....\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ll need both of these critical points....\u00a0...We\u2019ll need these....\u00a0...In this case we only need the first one since the second   is out of the interval....\u00a0...There are five critical points that are in the   interval.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0...Finally, to determine the absolute minimum and maximum   population we only need to plug these values into the function as well as the   two end points.\u00a0 Here are the function   evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...From these evaluations it appears that the minimum   population is 100,000 (remember that ...   is in thousands\u2026) which occurs at ...\u00a0and the maximum population is 111,900 which   occurs at .......\u00a0...Make sure that you can correctly solve trig equations.\u00a0 If we had forgotten the ...\u00a0we would have missed the last three critical points in the interval and hence gotten the wrong answer since the maximum population was at the final critical point....\u00a0...Also, note that we do really need to be very careful with rounding answers here.\u00a0 If we\u2019d rounded to the nearest integer, for instance, it would appear that the maximum population would have occurred at two different locations instead of only one....\u00a0...Suppose   that the amount of money in a bank account after ... years is given by,...Determine the minimum and maximum amount of money in the   account during the first 10 years that it is open....\u00a0...Here we are really asking for the absolute extrema of ... on the interval [0,10].\u00a0 As with the previous examples this function   is continuous everywhere and so we know that this can be done....\u00a0...We\u2019ll first need the derivative so we can find the   critical points....\u00a0...The derivative exists everywhere and the exponential is   never zero.\u00a0 Therefore the derivative   will only be zero where,...\u00a0...We\u2019ve got two critical points, however only ...\u00a0is actually in the interval so that is only   critical point that we\u2019ll use. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now evaluate the function at the lone critical point   and the end points of the interval.\u00a0   Here are those function evaluations....\u00a0...So, the maximum amount in the account will be $2000 which   occurs at ...\u00a0and the minimum amount in the account will   be $199.66 which occurs at the 2 year mark....\u00a0...In this example there are two important things to note.\u00a0 First, if we had included the second critical point we would have gotten an incorrect answer for the maximum amount so it\u2019s important to be careful with which critical points to include and which to exclude....\u00a0...All of the problems that we\u2019ve worked to this point had derivatives that existed everywhere and so the only critical points that we looked at were those for which the derivative is zero.\u00a0 Do not get too locked into this always happening.\u00a0 Most of the problems that we run into will be like this, but they won\u2019t all be like this....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another example to make this point....\u00a0...Determine   the absolute extrema for the following function and interval....Again, as with all the other examples here, this function   is continuous on the given interval and so we know that this can be done....\u00a0...First we\u2019ll need the derivative and make sure you can do   the simplification that we did here to make the work for finding the critical   points easier....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got two critical points....\u00a0...\u00a0...Both of these are in the interval so let\u2019s evaluate the   function at these points and the end points of the interval....\u00a0...The function has an absolute maximum of zero at ...\u00a0and the function will have an absolute   minimum of -15 at .......\u00a0...So, if we had ignored or forgotten about the critical   point where the derivative doesn\u2019t exist ( ...) we would not have gotten the   correct answer....\u00a0...In this section we\u2019ve seen how we can use a derivative to identify the absolute extrema of a function.\u00a0 This is an important application of derivatives that will arise from time to time so don\u2019t forget

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Most students have run across infinity at some point in time prior to a calculus class.\u00a0 However, when they have dealt with it, it was just a symbol used to represent a really, really large positive or really, really large negative number and that was the extent of it.\u00a0 Once they get into a calculus class students are asked to do some basic algebra with infinity and this is where they get into trouble.\u00a0 Infinity is NOT a number and for the most part doesn\u2019t behave like a number.\u00a0 However, despite that we\u2019ll think of infinity in this section as a really, really, really large number that is so large there isn\u2019t another number larger than it.\u00a0 This is not correct of course, but may help with the discussion in this section.\u00a0 Note as well that everything that we\u2019ll be discussing in this section applies only to real numbers.\u00a0 If you move into complex numbers for instance things can and do change....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start thinking about addition with infinity.\u00a0 When you add two non-zero numbers you get a new number.\u00a0 For example, ....\u00a0 With infinity this is not true.\u00a0 With infinity you have the following....\u00a0...In other words, a really, really large positive number ( ...) plus any positive number, regardless of the size, is still a really, really large positive number.\u00a0 Likewise, you can add a negative number (... ...) to a really, really large positive number and stay really, really large and positive.\u00a0 So, addition involving infinity can be dealt with in an intuitive way if you\u2019re careful.\u00a0 Note as well that the ... must NOT be negative infinity.\u00a0 If it is, there are some serious issues that we need to deal with as we\u2019ll see in a bit....\u00a0...Subtraction with negative infinity can also be dealt with in an intuitive way in most cases as well.\u00a0 A really, really large negative number minus any positive number, regardless of its size, is still a really, really large negative number.\u00a0 Subtracting a negative number (... ...)\u00a0 from a really, really large negative number will still be a really, really large negative number.\u00a0 Or,...Again, ... must not be negative infinity to avoid some potentially serious difficulties....\u00a0...Multiplication can be dealt with fairly intuitively as well.\u00a0 A really, really large number (positive, or negative) times any number, regardless of size, is still a really, really large number we\u2019ll just need to be careful with signs.\u00a0 In the case of multiplication we have...What you know about products of positive and negative numbers is still true here....\u00a0...Some forms of division can be dealt with intuitively as well.\u00a0 A really, really large number divided by a number that isn\u2019t too large is still a really, really large number....\u00a0...Division of a number by infinity is somewhat intuitive, but there are a couple of subtleties that you need to be aware of.\u00a0 When we talk about division by infinity we are really talking about a limiting process in which the denominator is going towards infinity.\u00a0 So, a number that isn\u2019t too large divided an increasingly large number is an increasingly small number.\u00a0 In other words in the limit we have,...So, we\u2019ve dealt with almost every basic algebraic operation involving infinity.\u00a0 There are two cases that that we haven\u2019t dealt with yet.\u00a0 These are...The problem with these two cases is that intuition doesn\u2019t really help here.\u00a0 A really, really large number minus a really, really large number can be anything ( ..., a constant, or ...).\u00a0 Likewise, a really, really large number divided by a really, really large number can also be anything ( ...\u00a0...\u00a0this depends on sign issues, 0, or a non-zero constant).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...What we\u2019ve got to remember here is that there are really, really large numbers and then there are really, really, really large numbers.\u00a0 In other words, some infinities are larger than other infinities.\u00a0 With addition, multiplication and the first sets of division we worked this wasn\u2019t an issue.\u00a0 The general size of the infinity just doesn\u2019t affect the answer in those cases.\u00a0 However, with the subtraction and division cases listed above, it does matter as we will see....\u00a0...Here is one way to think of this idea that some infinities are larger than others.\u00a0 This is a fairly dry and technical way to think of this and your calculus problems will probably never use this stuff, but it is a nice way of looking at this.\u00a0 Also, please note that I\u2019m not trying to give a precise proof of anything here.\u00a0 I\u2019m just trying to give you a little insight into the problems with infinity and how some infinities can be thought of as larger than others.\u00a0 For a much better (and definitely more precise) discussion see,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start by looking at how many integers there are.\u00a0 Clearly, I hope, there are an infinite number of them, but let\u2019s try to get a better grasp on the \u201csize\u201d of this infinity.\u00a0 So, pick any two integers completely at random.\u00a0 Start at the smaller of the two and list, in increasing order, all the integers that come after that.\u00a0 Eventually we will reach the larger of the two integers that you picked.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Depending on the relative size of the two integers it might take a very, very long time to list all the integers between them and there isn\u2019t really a purpose to doing it. But, it could be done if we wanted to and that\u2019s the important part.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Because we could list all these integers between two randomly chosen integers we say that the integers are ....\u00a0 Again, there is no real reason to actually do this, it is simply something that can be done if we should chose to do so....\u00a0...In general a set of numbers is called countably infinite if we can find a way to list them all out.\u00a0 In a more precise mathematical setting this is generally done with a special kind of function called a bijection that associates each number in the set with exactly one of the positive integers.\u00a0 To see some more details of this see the pdf given above....\u00a0...It can also be shown that the set of all fractions are also countably infinite, although this is a little harder to show and is not really the purpose of this discussion.\u00a0 To see a proof of this see the pdf given above.\u00a0 It has a very nice proof of this fact....\u00a0...Let\u2019s contrast this by trying to figure out how many numbers there are in the interval (0,1).\u00a0 By numbers, I mean all possible fractions that lie between zero and one as well as all possible decimals (that aren\u2019t fractions) that lie between zero and one.\u00a0 The following is similar to the proof given in the pdf above, but was nice enough and easy enough (I hope) that I wanted to include it here....\u00a0...To start let\u2019s assume that all the numbers in the interval (0,1) are countably infinite.\u00a0 This means that there should be a way to list all of them out.\u00a0 We could have something like the following,...Now, select the ...\u00a0 decimal out of ...\u00a0as shown below...and form a new number with these digits.\u00a0 So, for our example we would have the number...\u00a0...In this new decimal replace all the 3\u2019s with a 1 and replace every other numbers with a 3.\u00a0 In the case of our example this would yield the new number...\u00a0...Notice that this number is in the interval (0,1) and also notice that given how we choose the digits of the number this number will not be equal to the first number in our list, ..., because the first digit of each is guaranteed to not be the same.\u00a0 Likewise, this new number will not get the same number as the second in our list, ..., because the second digit of each is guaranteed to not be the same.\u00a0 Continuing in this manner we can see that this new number we constructed, ..., is guaranteed to not be in our listing.\u00a0 But this contradicts the initial assumption that we could list out all the numbers in the interval (0,1).\u00a0 Hence, it must not be possible to list out all the numbers in the interval (0,1)....\u00a0...Sets of numbers, such as all the numbers in (0,1), that we can\u2019t write down in a list are called ... infinite....\u00a0...The reason for going over this is the following.\u00a0 An infinity that is uncountably infinite is significantly larger than an infinity that is only countably infinite.\u00a0 So, if we take the difference of two infinities we have a couple of possibilities....Notice that we didn\u2019t put down a difference of two infinities of the same type.  Depending upon the context there might still have some ambiguity about just what the answer would be in this case, but that is a whole different topic....\u00a0...We could also do something similar for quotients of infinities....Again, we avoided a quotient of two infinities of the same type since, again depending upon the context, there might still be ambiguities about its value...\u00a0...So, that\u2019s it and hopefully you\u2019ve learned something from this discussion.\u00a0 Infinity simply isn\u2019t a number and because there are different kinds of infinity it generally doesn\u2019t behave as a number does. \u00a0Be careful when dealing with infinity.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/TypesOfInfinity.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Types of Infinity", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In order to allow these pages to be displayed on the web we\u2019ve broken the substitution rule examples into two sections.\u00a0 The previous section contains the introduction to the substitution rule and some fairly basic examples.\u00a0 The examples in this section tend towards the slightly more difficult side.\u00a0 Also, we\u2019ll not be putting quite as much explanation into the solutions here as we did in the previous section....\u00a0...In the first couple of sets of problems in this section the difficulty is not with the actual integration itself, but with the set up for the integration.\u00a0 Most of the integrals are fairly simple and most of the substitutions are fairly simple.\u00a0 The problems arise in getting the integral set up properly for the substitution(s) to be done.\u00a0 Once you see how these are done it\u2019s easy to see what you have to do, but the first time through these can cause problems if you aren\u2019t on the lookout for potential problems....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...This first integral has two terms in it and both will   require the same substitution.\u00a0 This   means that we won\u2019t have to do anything special to the integral.\u00a0 One of the more common \u201cmistakes\u201d here is   to break the integral up and do a separate substitution on each part.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t really mistake but will   definitely increase the amount of work we\u2019ll need to do.\u00a0 So, since both terms in the integral use   the same substitution we\u2019ll just do everything as a single integral using the   following substitution....The integral is then,...Often a substitution can be used multiple times in an   integral so don\u2019t get excited about that if it happens.\u00a0 Also note that since there was a ...\u00a0in front of the whole integral there must   also be a ...\u00a0in front of the answer from the integral.... ...This integral is similar to the previous one, but it might   not look like it at first glance.\u00a0 Here   is the substitution for this problem,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll plug the substitution into the problem twice (since   there are two cosines) and will only work because there is a sine multiplying   everything.\u00a0 Without that sine in front   we would not be able to use this substitution. ...\u00a0...The integral in this case is,...\u00a0...Again, be careful with the minus sign in front of the   whole integral....\u00a0...It should be fairly clear that each term in this integral   will use the same substitution, but let\u2019s rewrite things a little to make   things really clear....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Since each term   had an ... in it and we\u2019ll need that   for the differential we factored that out of both terms to get it into the   front.\u00a0 This integral is now very   similar to the previous one.\u00a0 Here\u2019s   the substitution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The integral   is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, as we\u2019ve seen in the previous set of examples sometimes we can use the same substitution more than once in an integral and doing so will simplify the work....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...In this integral the first term does not need any   substitution while the second term does need a substitution.\u00a0 So, to deal with that we\u2019ll need to split   the integral up as follows,...\u00a0...The substitution for the second integral is then,...\u00a0...The integral is,...\u00a0...Be careful with this kind of integral.\u00a0 One of the more common mistakes here is do   the following \u201cshortcut\u201d....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In other words,   some students will try do the substitution just the second term without   breaking up the integral.\u00a0 There are   two issues with this.\u00a0 First, there is   a \u201c-\u201d in front of the whole integral that shouldn\u2019t be there.\u00a0 It should only be on the second term   because that is the term getting the substitution.\u00a0 Secondly, and probably more importantly,   there are ...\u2019s in the integral and   we have a ... for the   differential.\u00a0 We can\u2019t mix variables   like this.\u00a0 When we do integrals all   the variables in the integrand must match the variable in the differential....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...The substitution for the first term is then,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s do the integral.\u00a0   Remember to first break it up into two terms before using the   substitution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this set of examples we saw that sometimes one (or potentially more than one) term in the integrand will not require a substitution.\u00a0 In these cases we\u2019ll need to break up the integral into two integrals, one involving the terms that don\u2019t need a substitution and another with the term(s) that do need a substitution....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...In this integral, unlike any integrals that we\u2019ve yet   done, there are two terms and each will require a different   substitution.\u00a0 So, to do this integral   we\u2019ll first need to split up the integral as follows,...\u00a0...Here are the substitutions for each integral....\u00a0...Notice that we used different letters for each   substitution to avoid confusion when we go to plug back in for ... and .......\u00a0...Here is the integral.... ...\u00a0As with the last   problem this integral will require two separate substitutions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first break up the integral....Here are the substitutions for this integral....The integral is then,... ...The last problem in this set can be tricky.\u00a0 If there was just an ... in the numerator we could do a quick substitution to get a   natural logarithm.\u00a0 Likewise if there   wasn\u2019t an ... in the numerator we   would get an inverse tangent after a quick substitution....\u00a0...To get this integral into a form that we can work with we   will first need to break it up as follows....\u00a0...We now have two integrals each requiring a different   substitution.\u00a0 The substitutions for   each of the integrals above are,...\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...We\u2019ve now seen a set of integrals in which we need to do more than one substitution.\u00a0 In these cases we will need to break up the integral into separate integrals and do separate substitutions for each....\u00a0...We now need to move onto a different set of examples that can be a little tricky.\u00a0 Once you\u2019ve seen how to do these they aren\u2019t too bad, but doing them for the first time can be difficult if you aren\u2019t ready for them. ...\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....   ...   ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...The first question about this problem is probably why is   it here?\u00a0 Substitution rule problems   generally require more than a single function.\u00a0 The key to this problem is to realize that   there really are two functions here.\u00a0   All we need to do is remember the definition of tangent and we can   write the integral as,...\u00a0...Written in this way we can see that the following   substitution will work for us,...\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...Now, while this is a perfectly serviceable answer that   minus sign in front is liable to cause problems if we aren\u2019t careful.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s rewrite things a little.\u00a0 Recalling a ... of logarithms we can move the   minus sign in front to an exponent on the cosine and then do a little   simplification....\u00a0...This is the formula that is typically given for the   integral of tangent....\u00a0...Note that we could integrate cotangent in a similar   manner.... ...This problem also at first appears to not belong in the   substitution rule problems.\u00a0 This is   even more of a problem upon noticing that we can\u2019t just use the definition of   the secant function to write this in a form that will allow the use of the   substitution rule....\u00a0...This problem is going to require a technique that isn\u2019t   used terribly often at this level, but is a useful technique to be aware   of.\u00a0 Sometimes we can make an integral   doable by multiplying the top and bottom by a common term.\u00a0 This will not always work and even when it   does it is not always clear what we should multiply by but when it works it   is very useful....\u00a0...Here is how we\u2019ll use this idea for this problem....\u00a0...First, we will think of the secant as a fraction and then   multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by the same term.\u00a0 It is probably not clear why one would want   to do this here but doing this will actually allow us to use the substitution   rule.\u00a0 To see how this will work let\u2019s   simplify the integrand somewhat....\u00a0...We can now use the following substitution....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...Sometimes multiplying the top and bottom of a fraction by   a carefully chosen term will allow us to work a problem.\u00a0 It does however take some thought sometimes   to determine just what the term should be....\u00a0...We can use a similar process for integrating cosecant....\u00a0... ...This next problem has a subtlety to it that can get us in   trouble if we aren\u2019t paying attention.\u00a0   Because of the root in the cosine it makes some sense to use the   following substitution....\u00a0...This is where we need to be careful.\u00a0 Upon rewriting the differential we get,...The root that is in the denominator will not become a ... as we might have been tempted to   do.\u00a0 Instead it will get taken care of   in the differential....\u00a0...The integral is,...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...With this problem we need to very carefully pick our   substitution.\u00a0 As the problem is   written we might be tempted to use the following substitution,...\u00a0...However, this won\u2019t work as you can probably see.\u00a0 The differential doesn\u2019t show up anywhere   in the integrand and we just wouldn\u2019t be able to eliminate all the ...\u2019s with this substitution....\u00a0...In order to work this problem we will need to rewrite the   integrand as follows,...\u00a0...We will now use the substitution,...\u00a0...The integral is,...\u00a0...Some substitutions can be really tricky to see and it\u2019s   not unusual that you\u2019ll need to do some simplification and/or rewriting to   get a substitution to work....\u00a0... ...This last problem in this set is different from all the   other substitution problems that we\u2019ve worked to this point.\u00a0 Given the fact that we\u2019ve got more than an ... under the root it makes sense that   the substitution pretty much has to be,...\u00a0...At first glance it looks like this might not work for the substitution because we have an ... in front of the root.  However, if we first rewrite 2... = ...(2...) we could then move the 2... to the end of the integral so at least the ... will show up explicitly in the integral.  Doing this gives the following,      ...\u00a0...This is a real problem.\u00a0   Our integrals can\u2019t have two variables in them.\u00a0 Normally this would mean that we chose our   substitution incorrectly.\u00a0 However, in   this case we can rewrite the substitution as follows,...and now, we can eliminate the remaining ...\u2019s from our integral.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Sometimes, we will need to use a substitution more than   once....\u00a0...This kind of problem doesn\u2019t arise all that often and when   it does there will sometimes be alternate methods of doing the integral.\u00a0 However, it will often work out that the   easiest method of doing the integral is to do what we just did here....\u00a0...This final set of examples isn\u2019t too bad once you see the substitutions and that is the point with this set of problems.\u00a0 These all involve substitutions that we\u2019ve not seen prior to this and so we need to see some of these kinds of problems....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....   ...   ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...In this case we know that we can\u2019t integrate a logarithm   by itself and so it makes some sense (hopefully) that the logarithm will need   to be in the substitution.\u00a0 Here is the   substitution for this problem....\u00a0...So the ... in the   denominator of the integrand will get substituted away with the   differential.\u00a0 Here is the integral for   this problem.... ...Again, the substitution here may seem a little   tricky.\u00a0 In this case the substitution   is,...\u00a0...The integral is then,... ...In this case we can\u2019t use the same type of substitution   that we used in the previous problem.\u00a0   In order to use the substitution in the previous example the   exponential in the numerator and the denominator need to be the same and in   this case they aren\u2019t....\u00a0...To see the correct substitution for this problem note   that,...\u00a0...Using this, the integral can be written as follows,...\u00a0...We can now use the following substitution....\u00a0...The integral is then,... ...This integral is similar to the first problem in this   set.\u00a0 Since we don\u2019t know how to   integrate inverse sine functions it seems likely that this will be our   substitution.\u00a0 If we use this as our   substitution we get,...\u00a0...So, the root in the integral will get taken care of in the   substitution process and this will eliminate all the ...\u2019s from the integral.\u00a0   Therefore this was the correct substitution....\u00a0...The integral is,...\u00a0...Over the last couple of sections we\u2019ve seen a lot of substitution rule examples.\u00a0 There are a couple of general rules that we will need to remember when doing these problems.\u00a0 First, when doing a substitution remember that when the substitution is done all the ...\u2019s in the integral (or whatever variable is being used for that particular integral) should all be substituted away.\u00a0 This includes the ... in the ....\u00a0 After the substitution only ...\u2019s should be left in the integral.\u00a0 Also, sometimes the correct substitution is a little tricky to find and more often than not there will need to be some manipulation of the differential or integrand in order to actually do the substitution....\u00a0...Also, many integrals will require us to break them up so we can do multiple substitutions so be on the lookout for those kinds of integrals/substitutions.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/SubstitutionRuleIndefinitePtII.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - More Substitution Rule", "subject": "math"}},

and end up   with an exponent of \u201c-7\u201d instead of the correct exponent of \u201c-5\u201d....\u00a0... ...This is here just to make sure we get the point about   integrating negative exponents....\u00a0... ...In this case there isn\u2019t a formula for explicitly dealing   with radicals or rational expressions.\u00a0   However, just like with derivatives we can write all these terms so   they are in the numerator and they all have an exponent.\u00a0\u00a0 This should always be your first step when   faced with this kind of integral just as it was when differentiating....\u00a0...When dealing with fractional exponents we usually don\u2019t   \u201cdivide by the new exponent\u201d.\u00a0 Doing   this is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of the new exponent and   so that is what we will usually do....\u00a0... ...Don\u2019t make this one harder than it is\u2026...\u00a0...In this case we are really just integrating a one!...\u00a0... ...We\u2019ve got a product here and as we noted in the previous   section there is no rule for dealing with products.\u00a0 However, in this case we don\u2019t need a   rule.\u00a0 All that we need to do is   multiply things out (taking care of the radicals at the same time of course)   and then we will be able to integrate....\u00a0... ...As with the previous part it\u2019s not really a problem that   we don\u2019t have a rule for quotients for this integral.\u00a0 In this case all we need to do is break up   the quotient and then integrate the individual terms....\u00a0...\u00a0...Be careful to not think of the third term as ... to a power for the purposes of   integration.\u00a0 Using that rule on the   third term will NOT work.\u00a0 The third   term is simply a logarithm.\u00a0 Also,   don\u2019t get excited about the 15.\u00a0 The 15   is just a constant and so it can be factored out of the integral.\u00a0 In other words, here is what we did to   integrate the third term....\u00a0...Always remember that you can\u2019t integrate products and quotients in the same way that we integrate sums and differences.\u00a0 At this point the only way to integrate products and quotients is to multiply the product out or break up the quotient.\u00a0 Eventually we\u2019ll see some other products and quotients that can be dealt with in other ways.\u00a0 However, there will never be a single rule that will work for all products and there will never be a single rule that will work for all quotients.\u00a0 Every product and quotient is different and will need to be worked on a case by case basis....\u00a0...The first set of examples focused almost exclusively on powers of ... (or whatever variable we used in each example).\u00a0 It\u2019s time to do some examples that involve other functions....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...   ...   ...Most of the problems in this example will simply use the   formulas from the beginning of this section.\u00a0   More complicated problems involving most of these functions will need   to wait until we reach the Substitution Rule....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...There isn\u2019t anything to this one other than using the   formulas.... ...Let\u2019s be a little careful with this one.\u00a0 First break it up into two integrals and   note the rewritten integrand on the second integral....\u00a0...Rewriting the second integrand will help a little with the   integration at this early stage.\u00a0 We   can think of the 6 in the denominator as a 1/6 out in front of the term and   then since this is a constant it can be factored out of the integral.\u00a0 The answer is then,...\u00a0...Note that we didn\u2019t factor the 2 out of the first integral   as we factored the 1/6 out of the second.\u00a0   In fact, we will generally not factor the 1/6 out either in later   problems.\u00a0 It was only done here to   make sure that you could follow what we were doing....\u00a0... ...In this one we\u2019ll just use the formulas from above and   don\u2019t get excited about the coefficients.\u00a0   They are just multiplicative constants and so can be ignored while we   integrate each term and then once we\u2019re done integrating a given term we   simply put the coefficients back in....\u00a0... ...Again, there really isn\u2019t a whole lot to do with this one   other than to use the appropriate formula from above....\u00a0... ...This one can be a little tricky if you aren\u2019t ready for   it.\u00a0 As discussed previously, at this   point the only way we have of dealing with quotients is to break it up....\u00a0...Notice that upon breaking the integral up we further   simplified the integrand by recalling the definition of cosecant.\u00a0 With this simplification we can do the   integral....\u00a0...As shown in the last part of this example we can do some fairly complicated looking quotients at this point if we remember to do simplifications when we see them.\u00a0 In fact, this is something that you should always keep in mind.\u00a0 In almost any problem that we\u2019re doing here don\u2019t forget to simplify where possible.\u00a0 In almost every case this can only help the problem and will rarely complicate the problem....\u00a0...In the next problem we\u2019re going to take a look at a product and this time we\u2019re not going to be able to just multiply the product out.\u00a0 However, if we recall the comment about simplifying a little this problem becomes fairly simple....\u00a0...Integrate   .......\u00a0...There are several ways to do this integral and most of   them require the next section.\u00a0   However, there is a way to do this integral using only the material   from this section.\u00a0 All that is   required is to remember the trig formula that we can use to simplify the   integrand up a little.\u00a0 Recall the   following double angle formula....\u00a0...A small rewrite of this formula gives,...\u00a0...If we now replace all the ...\u2019s with ...\u00a0we get,...\u00a0...Using this formula the integral becomes something we can   do....\u00a0...As noted earlier there is another method for doing this   integral.\u00a0 In fact there are two   alternate methods.\u00a0 To see all three   check out the section on ... in the Extras chapter but be aware that the other two do   require the material covered in the next section....\u00a0...The formula/simplification in the previous problem is a nice \u201ctrick\u201d to remember.\u00a0 It can be used on occasion to greatly simplify some problems....\u00a0...There is one more set of examples that we should do before moving out of this section....\u00a0...Given   the following information determine the function .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...In both of these we will need to remember that ...Also note that because we are giving values of the   function at specific points we are also going to be determining what the constant   of integration will be in these problems....\u00a0... ...The first step here is to integrate to determine the most   general possible .......\u00a0...Now we have a value of the function so let\u2019s plug in ...\u00a0and determine the value of the constant of   integration .......So, from this it looks like ....\u00a0 This means that the function is,...\u00a0... ...This one is a little different from the first one.\u00a0 In order to get the function we will need   the first derivative and we have the second derivative.\u00a0 We can however, use an integral to get the   first derivative from the second derivative, just as we used an integral to   get the function from the first derivative....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s first get the most general possible first   derivative....Don\u2019t forget the constant of integration!...\u00a0...We can now find the most general possible function....Do not get excited about integrating the ....\u00a0   It\u2019s just a constant and we know how to integrate constants.\u00a0 Also, there will be no reason to think the constants   of integration from the integration in each step will be the same and so   we\u2019ll need to call each constant of integration something different.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, plug in the two values of the function that we\u2019ve   got....\u00a0...This gives us a system of two equations in two unknowns   that we can solve....\u00a0...The function is then,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t remember how to solve systems?\u00a0 Check out the ... portion of   my Algebra/Trig Review....\u00a0...In this section we\u2019ve started the process of integration.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen how to do quite a few basic integrals and we also saw a quick application of integrals in the last example. ...\u00a0...There are many new formulas in this section that we\u2019ll now have to know.\u00a0 However, if you think about it, they aren\u2019t really new formulas.\u00a0 They are really nothing more than derivative formulas that we should already know written in terms of integrals.\u00a0 If you remember that you should find it easier to remember the formulas in this section....\u00a0...Always remember that integration is asking nothing more than what function did we differentiate to get the integrand.\u00a0 If you can remember that many of the basic integrals that we saw in this section and many of the integrals in the coming sections aren\u2019t too bad.

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to look at finding the area between two curves.\u00a0 There are actually two cases that we are going to be looking at....\u00a0...In the first case we want to determine the area between ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0on the interval [...].\u00a0 We are also going to assume that ....\u00a0 Take a look at the following sketch to get an idea of what we\u2019re initially going to look at....\u00a0...In the ... section of the Extras chapter we derived the following formula for the area in this case....The second case is almost identical to the first case.\u00a0 Here we are going to determine the area between ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0on the interval [...] with .......\u00a0...In this case the formula is,...\u00a0...Now ... and ... are perfectly serviceable formulas, however, it is sometimes easy to forget that these always require the first function to be the larger of the two functions.\u00a0 So, instead of these formulas we will instead use the following \u201cword\u201d formulas to make sure that we remember that the area is always the \u201clarger\u201d function minus the \u201csmaller\u201d function....\u00a0...In the first case we will use,...\u00a0...In the second case we will use,...\u00a0...Using these formulas will always force us to think about what is going on with each problem and to make sure that we\u2019ve got the correct order of functions when we go to use the formula....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work an example....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region enclosed by ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...First of all, just what do we mean by \u201carea enclosed   by\u201d.\u00a0 This means that the region we\u2019re   interested in must have one of the two curves on every boundary of the   region.\u00a0 So, here is a graph of the two   functions with the enclosed region shaded....Note that we don\u2019t take any part of the region to the   right of the intersection point of these two graphs.\u00a0 In this region there is no boundary on the   right side and so is not part of the enclosed area.\u00a0 Remember that one of the given functions   must be on the each boundary of the enclosed region....\u00a0...Also from this graph it\u2019s clear that the upper function   will be dependent on the range of ...\u2019s   that we use.\u00a0 Because of this you   should always sketch of a graph of the region.\u00a0 Without a sketch it\u2019s often easy to mistake   which of the two functions is the larger.\u00a0   In this case most would probably say that ...\u00a0is the upper function and they would be   right for the vast majority of the ...\u2019s.\u00a0 However, in this case it is the lower of   the two functions....\u00a0...The limits of integration for this will be the   intersection points of the two curves.\u00a0   In this case it\u2019s pretty easy to see that they will intersect at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0so these are the limits of integration....\u00a0...So, the integral that we\u2019ll need to compute to find the   area is,...\u00a0...Before moving on to the next example, there are a couple of important things to note.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, in almost all of these problems a graph is pretty much required.\u00a0 Often the bounding region, which will give the limits of integration, is difficult to determine without a graph.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, it can often be difficult to determine which of the functions is the upper function and which is the lower function without a graph.\u00a0 This is especially true in cases like the last example where the answer to that question actually depended upon the range of ...\u2019s that we were using....\u00a0...Finally, unlike the area under a curve that we looked at in the previous chapter the area between two curves will always be positive.\u00a0 If we get a negative number or zero we can be sure that we\u2019ve made a mistake somewhere and will need to go back and find it....\u00a0...Note as well that sometimes instead of saying region enclosed by we will say region bounded by.\u00a0 They mean the same thing....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region bounded by ...,   ...,   ...,   and the ...-axis....\u00a0...In this case the last two pieces of information, ...\u00a0and the ...-axis,   tell us the right and left boundaries of the region.\u00a0 Also, recall that the ...-axis is given by the line ....\u00a0 Here is the graph with the enclosed region   shaded in....\u00a0...Here, unlike the first example, the two curves don\u2019t meet.   \u00a0Instead we rely on two vertical lines   to bound the left and right sides of the region as we noted above...\u00a0...Here is the integral that will give the area....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region bounded by ...and .......\u00a0...In this case the intersection points (which we\u2019ll need   eventually) are not going to be easily identified from the graph so let\u2019s go   ahead and get them now.\u00a0 Note that for   most of these problems you\u2019ll not be able to accurately identify the   intersection points from the graph and so you\u2019ll need to be able to determine   them by hand.\u00a0 In this case we can get   the intersection points by setting the two equations equal....\u00a0...So it looks like the two curves will intersect at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 If we need them we can get the ... values corresponding to each of   these by plugging the values back into either of the equations.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that the   coordinates of the two intersection points on the graph are (-1,12) and   (3,28).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note as well that if you aren\u2019t good at graphing knowing   the intersection points can help in at least getting the graph started.\u00a0 Here is a graph of the region....\u00a0...With the graph we can now identify the upper and lower   function and so we can now find the enclosed area....\u00a0...Be careful with parenthesis in these problems.\u00a0 One of the more common mistakes students make with these problems is to neglect parenthesis on the second term....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region bounded by ...,   ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0...So, the functions used in this problem are identical to   the functions from the first problem.\u00a0   The difference is that we\u2019ve extended the bounded region out from the   intersection points.\u00a0 Since these are   the same functions we used in the previous example we won\u2019t bother finding   the intersection points again....\u00a0...Here is a graph of this region....\u00a0...Okay, we have a small problem here.\u00a0 Our formula requires that one function   always be the upper function and the other function always be the lower   function and we clearly do not have that here.\u00a0 However, this actually isn\u2019t the problem   that it might at first appear to be.\u00a0   There are three regions in which one function is always the upper   function and the other is always the lower function.\u00a0 So, all that we need to do is find the area   of each of the three regions, which we can do, and then add them all up....\u00a0...Here is the area....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region enclosed by ...,   ...,   ...,   and the ...-axis....\u00a0...First let\u2019s get a graph of the region....\u00a0...So, we have another situation where we will need to do two   integrals to get the area.\u00a0 The   intersection point will be where ...in the interval.\u00a0   We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that this will be ....\u00a0 The area is then,...\u00a0...We will need to be careful with this next example.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region enclosed by ...\u00a0and .......Don\u2019t let the first equation get you upset.\u00a0 We will have to deal with these kinds of   equations occasionally so we\u2019ll need to get used to dealing with them....\u00a0...As always, it will help if we have the intersection points   for the two curves.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll   get the intersection points by solving the second equation for ... and then setting them equal.\u00a0 Here is that work,...So, it looks like the two curves will intersect at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0or if we need the full coordinates they will   be : (-1,-2) and (5,4)....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the two curves....\u00a0...Now, we will have a serious problem at this point if we   aren\u2019t careful.\u00a0 To this point we\u2019ve   been using an upper function and a lower function.\u00a0 To do that here notice that there are   actually two portions of the region that will have different lower   functions.\u00a0 In the range [-2,-1] the   parabola is actually both the upper and the lower function....\u00a0...To use the formula that we\u2019ve been using to this point we   need to solve the parabola for ....\u00a0 This gives,...where the \u201c+\u201d gives the upper portion of the parabola and   the \u201c-\u201d gives the lower portion.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the complete area with each region   shaded that we\u2019d need if we were going to use the first formula....\u00a0...The integrals for the area would then be,...\u00a0...While these integrals aren\u2019t terribly difficult they are   more difficult than they need to be....\u00a0...Recall that there is another formula for determining the   area.\u00a0 It is,...and in our case we do have one function that is always on   the left and the other is always on the right.\u00a0 So, in this case this is definitely the way   to go.\u00a0 Note that we will need to   rewrite the equation of the line since it will need to be in the form ...\u00a0but that is easy enough to do.\u00a0 Here is the graph for using this formula....\u00a0...The area is,...\u00a0...This is the same that we got using the first formula and   this was definitely easier than the first method....\u00a0...So, in this last example we\u2019ve seen a case where we could use either formula to find the area.\u00a0 However, the second was definitely easier.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Students often come into a calculus class with the idea that the only easy way to work with functions is to use them in the form ....\u00a0 However, as we\u2019ve seen in this previous example there are definitely times when it will be easier to work with functions in the form ....\u00a0 In fact, there are going to be occasions when this will be the only way in which a problem can be worked so make sure that you can deal with functions in this form....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at one more example to make sure we can deal with functions in this form....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region bounded by ...\u00a0and .......First, we will need intersection points....\u00a0...The intersection points are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Here is a sketch of the region....This is definitely a region where the second area formula   will be easier.\u00a0 If we used the first   formula there would be three different regions that we\u2019d have to

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we need to address a couple of topics about the constant of integration.\u00a0 Throughout most calculus classes we play pretty fast and loose with it and because of that many students don\u2019t really understand it or how it can be important....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s address how we play fast and loose with it.\u00a0 Recall that technically when we integrate a sum or difference we are actually doing multiple integrals.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...Upon evaluating each of these integrals we should get a constant of integration for each integral since we really are doing two integrals....\u00a0...\u00a0...Since there is no reason to think that the constants of integration will be the same from each integral we use different constants for each integral....\u00a0...Now, both ... and ... are unknown constants and so the sum of two unknown constants is just an unknown constant and we acknowledge that by simply writing the sum as a .......\u00a0...So, the integral is then,...\u00a0...We also tend to play fast and loose with constants of integration in some substitution rule problems.\u00a0 Consider the following problem,...\u00a0...Technically when we integrate we should get,...\u00a0...Since the whole integral is multiplied by ..., the whole answer, including the constant of integration, should be multiplied by ....\u00a0 Upon multiplying the ...\u00a0through the answer we get,...\u00a0...However, since the constant of integration is an unknown constant dividing it by 2 isn\u2019t going to change that fact so we tend to just write the fraction as a .......\u00a0...In general, we don\u2019t really need to worry about how we\u2019ve played fast and loose with the constant of integration in either of the two examples above....\u00a0...The real problem however is that because we play fast and loose with these constants of integration most students don\u2019t really have a good grasp oF them and don\u2019t understand that there are times where the constants of integration are important and that we need to be careful with them....\u00a0...To see how a lack of understanding about the constant of integration can cause problems consider the following integral....\u00a0...This is a really simple integral.\u00a0 However, there are two ways (both simple) to integrate it and that is where the problem arises....\u00a0...The first integration method is to just break up the fraction and do the integral....\u00a0...The second way is to use the following substitution....\u00a0...Can you see the problem?\u00a0 We integrated the same function and got very different answers.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0 Integrating the same function should give us the same answer.\u00a0 We only used different methods to do the integral and both are perfectly legitimate integration methods.\u00a0 So, how can using different methods produce different answer?...\u00a0...The first thing that we should notice is that because we used a different method for each there is no reason to think that the constant of integration will in fact be the same number and so we really should use different letters for each.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...More appropriate answers would be,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take another look at the second answer.\u00a0 Using a property of logarithms we can write the answer to the second integral as follows,...\u00a0...Upon doing this we can see that the answers really aren\u2019t that different after all.\u00a0 In fact they only differ by a constant and we can even find a relationship between ... and ....\u00a0 It looks like,...\u00a0...So, without a proper understanding of the constant of integration, in particular using different integration techniques on the same integral will likely produce a different constant of integration, we might never figure out why we got \u201cdifferent\u201d answers for the integral....\u00a0...Note as well that getting answers that differ by a constant doesn\u2019t violate any principles of calculus.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve actually seen a fact that suggested that this might happen.\u00a0 We saw a fact in the ... section that said that if ...\u00a0then ....\u00a0 In other words, if two functions have the same derivative then they can differ by no more than a constant....\u00a0...This is exactly what we\u2019ve got here.\u00a0 The two functions,...have exactly the same derivative,...and as we\u2019ve shown they really only differ by a constant....\u00a0...There is another integral that also exhibits this behavior.\u00a0 Consider,...\u00a0...There are actually three different methods for doing this integral....\u00a0...This method uses a trig formula,...Using this formula (and a quick substitution) the integral becomes,...\u00a0...This method uses the substitution,...\u00a0...Here is another substitution that could be done here as well....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got three different answers each with a different constant of integration.\u00a0 However, according to the fact above these three answers should only differ by a constant since they all have the same derivative....\u00a0...In fact they do only differ by a constant.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need the following trig formulas to prove this....\u00a0...Start with the answer from the first method and use the double angle formula above....\u00a0...Now, from the second identity above we have,...so, plug this in,...This is then answer we got from the second method with a slightly different constant.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...We can do a similar manipulation to get the answer from the third method.\u00a0 Again, starting with the answer from the first method use the double angle formula and then substitute in for the cosine instead of the sine using,...\u00a0...Doing this gives,...which is the answer from the third method with a different constant and again we can relate the two constants by,...\u00a0...So, what have we learned here?\u00a0 Hopefully we\u2019ve seen that constants of integration are important and we can\u2019t forget about them.\u00a0 We often don\u2019t work with them in a Calculus I course, yet without a good understanding of them we would be hard pressed to understand how different integration methods and apparently produce different answers.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ConstantOfIntegration.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Constant of Integration",

There are lots of different kinds of problems and after working many problems you\u2019ll start to get a real feel for these problems and after you work enough of them you\u2019ll reach the point where you\u2019ll be able to do simple substitutions in your head without having to actually write anything down....\u00a0...As a final note we should point out that often (in fact in almost every case) the differential will not appear exactly in the integrand as it did in the example above and sometimes we\u2019ll need to do some manipulation of the integrand and/or the differential to get all the ...\u2019s to disappear in the substitution....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some examples so we can get a better idea on how the substitution rule works....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...   ...   ... ...In this case we know how to integrate just a cosine so   let\u2019s make the substitution the stuff that is inside the cosine....So, as with the first example we worked the stuff in front   of the cosine appears exactly in the differential.\u00a0 The integral is then,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget to go back to the original variable in the   problem....\u00a0... ...Again, we know how to integrate an exponential by itself   so it looks like the substitution for this problem should be,...Now, with the exception of the 3 the stuff in front of the   exponential appears exactly in the differential.\u00a0 Recall however that we can factor the 3 out   of the integral and so it won\u2019t cause any problems.\u00a0 The integral is then,...\u00a0... ...In this case it looks like the following should be the   substitution....Okay, now we have a small problem.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got an ... out in front of the parenthesis but we don\u2019t have a   \u201c-30\u201d.\u00a0 This is not really the problem   it might appear to be at first.\u00a0 We   will simply rewrite the differential as follows....With this we can now substitute the \u201c...\u201d away.\u00a0 In   the process we will pick up a constant, but that isn\u2019t a problem since it can   always be factored out of the integral....\u00a0...We can now do the integral....\u00a0...Note that in most problems when we pick up a constant as   we did in this example we will generally factor it out of the integral in the   same step that we substitute it in.\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...In this example don\u2019t forget to bring the root up to the   numerator and change it into fractional exponent form.\u00a0 Upon doing this we can see that the   substitution is,...The integral is then,...\u00a0...In the previous set of examples the substitution was generally pretty clear.\u00a0 There was exactly one term that had an \u201cinside function\u201d that we also couldn\u2019t integrate.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at some more complicated problems to make sure we don\u2019t come to expect all substitutions are like those in the previous set of examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...   ...   ... ...In this problem there are two \u201cinside functions\u201d.\u00a0 There is the ...\u00a0that is inside the two trig functions and   there is also the term that is raised to the 4... power.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are two ways to proceed with this problem.\u00a0 The first idea that many students have is   substitute the ...\u00a0away.\u00a0   There is nothing wrong with doing this but it doesn\u2019t eliminate the   problem of the term to the 4... power.\u00a0 That\u2019s still there and if we used this idea   we would then need to do a second substitution to deal with that....\u00a0...The second (and much easier) way of doing this problem is   to just deal with the stuff raised to the 4... power and see what   we get.\u00a0 The substitution in this case   would be,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Two things to   note here.\u00a0 First, don\u2019t forget to   correctly deal with the \u201c-\u201d.\u00a0 A common   mistake at this point is to lose it.\u00a0   Secondly, notice that the ...\u00a0turns out to not really be a problem after   all.\u00a0 Because the ...\u00a0was \u201cburied\u201d in the substitution that we   actually used it was also taken care of at the same time.\u00a0 The integral is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As seen in this   example sometimes there will seem to be two substitutions that will need to   be done however, if one of them is buried inside of another substitution then   we\u2019ll only really need to do one.\u00a0   Recognizing this can save a lot of time in working some of these   problems....\u00a0... ...This one is a little tricky at first.\u00a0 We can see the correct substitution by   recalling that,...\u00a0...Using this it looks like the correct substitution is,...\u00a0...Notice that we again had two apparent substitutions in   this integral but again the 3... is   buried in the substitution we\u2019re using and so we didn\u2019t need to worry about   it....Here is the integral....\u00a0...Note that the one third in front of the integral came   about from the substitution on the differential and we just factored it out   to the front of the integral.\u00a0 This is   what we will usually do with these constants....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...   ...\u00a0...The integral is   now,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The most important thing to remember in substitution problems is that after the substitution all the original variables need to disappear from the integral.\u00a0 After the substitution the only variables that should be present in the integral should be the new variable from the substitution (usually ...).\u00a0 Note as well that this includes the variables in the differential!...\u00a0...This next set of examples, while not particular difficult, can cause trouble if we aren\u2019t paying attention to what we\u2019re doing....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...We haven\u2019t seen a problem quite like this one yet.\u00a0 Let\u2019s notice that if we take the denominator   and differentiate it we get just a constant and the only thing that we have   in the numerator is also a constant.\u00a0   This is a pretty good indication that we can use the denominator for   our substitution so,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...The integral is   now,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Remember that   we can just factor the 3 in the numerator out of the integral and that makes   the integral a little clearer in this case....\u00a0... ...The integral is very similar to the previous one with a   couple of minor differences but notice that again if we differentiate the   denominator we get something that is different from the numerator by only a   multiplicative constant.\u00a0 Therefore   we\u2019ll again take the denominator as our substitution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The integral   is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...Now, this one is almost identical to the previous part   except we added a power onto the denominator.\u00a0   Notice however that if we ignore the power and differentiate what\u2019s   left we get the same thing as the previous example so we\u2019ll use the same   substitution here....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The integral in   this case is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Be careful in this case to not turn this into a   logarithm.\u00a0 After working problems like   the first two in this set a common error is to turn every rational expression   into a logarithm.\u00a0 If there is a power   on the whole denominator then there is a good chance that it isn\u2019t a   logarithm....\u00a0...The idea that we used in the last three parts to determine   the substitution is not a bad idea to remember.\u00a0 If we\u2019ve got a rational expression try   differentiating the denominator (ignoring any powers that are on the whole   denominator) and if the result is the numerator or only differs from the   numerator by a multiplicative constant then we can usually use that as our   substitution....\u00a0... ...Now, this part is completely different from the first   three and yet seems similar to them as well.\u00a0   In this case if we differentiate the denominator we get a ... that is not in the numerator and so   we can\u2019t use the denominator as our substitution.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In fact, because we have ... in the denominator and no ... in the numerator is an indication of how to work this problem.   This integral is going to be an inverse tangent when we are done.\u00a0 The key to seeing this is to recall the   following formula,...\u00a0...We clearly don\u2019t have exactly this but we do have   something that is similar.\u00a0 The   denominator has a squared term plus a constant and the numerator is just a   constant.\u00a0 So, with a little work and   the proper substitution we should be able to get our integral into a form   that will allow us to use this formula.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...There is one part of this formula that is really important   and that is the \u201c1+\u201d in the denominator.\u00a0   That must be there and we\u2019ve got a \u201c4+\u201d but it is easy enough to take   care of that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll just factor a 4   out of the denominator and at the same time we\u2019ll factor the 3 in the   numerator out of the integral as well.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Notice that in the last step we rewrote things a little in   the denominator.\u00a0 This will help us to   see what the substitution needs to be.\u00a0   In order to get this integral into the formula above we need to end up   with a ... in the   denominator.\u00a0 Our substitution will   then need to be something that upon squaring gives us ....\u00a0 With the rewrite we can see what that we\u2019ll   need to use the following substitution....\u00a0...Don\u2019t get excited about the root in the substitution, these   will show up on occasion.\u00a0 Upon   plugging our substitution in we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...After doing the   substitution, and factoring any constants out, we get exactly the integral   that gives an inverse tangent and so we know that we did the correct   substitution for this integral.\u00a0 The   integral is then,...\u00a0...In this last set of integrals we had four integrals that were similar to each other in many ways and yet all either yielded different answer using the same substitution or used a completely different substitution than one that was similar to it.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is a fairly common occurrence and so you will need to be able to deal with these kinds of issues.\u00a0 There are many integrals that on the surface look very similar and yet will use a completely different substitution or will yield a completely different answer when using the same substitution....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another set of examples to give us more practice in recognizing these kinds of issues.\u00a0 Note however that we won\u2019t be putting as much detail into these as we did with the previous examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...Clearly the derivative of the denominator, ignoring the   exponent, differs from the numerator only by a multiplicative constant and so   the substitution is,...\u00a0...After a little manipulation of the differential we get the   following integral....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...The only difference between this problem and the previous   one is the denominator.\u00a0 In the   previous problem the whole denominator is cubed and in this problem the   denominator has no power on it.\u00a0 The   same substitution will work in this problem but because we no longer have the   power the problem will be different....\u00a0...So, using the substitution from the previous example the   integral

before we start learning how to solve this is does this equation come up naturally anywhere?\u00a0 The answer is a very resounding yes!\u00a0 If we consider the 2-D heat equation,...\u00a0...\u00a0We can see that Laplace\u2019s equation would correspond to finding the equilibrium solution (... time independent solution) if there were not sources.\u00a0 So, this is an equation that can arise from physical situations....\u00a0...How we solve Laplace\u2019s equation will depend upon the geometry of the 2-D object we\u2019re solving it on.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start out by solving it on the rectangle

we will not have any initial conditions here.\u00a0 Both variables are spatial variables and each variable occurs in a 2... order derivative and so we\u2019ll need two boundary conditions for each variable....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s notice that while the partial differential equation is both linear and homogeneous the boundary conditions are only linear and are not homogeneous.\u00a0 This creates a problem because separation of variables requires homogeneous boundary conditions....\u00a0...To completely solve Laplace\u2019s equation we\u2019re in fact going to have to solve it four times.\u00a0 Each time we solve it only one of the four boundary conditions can be nonhomogeneous while the remaining three will be homogeneous.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The four problems are probably best shown with a quick sketch so let\u2019s consider the following sketch....\u00a0...Now, once we solve all four of these problems the solution to our original system, ..., will be,...\u00a0...Because we know that Laplace\u2019s equation is linear and homogeneous and each of the pieces is a solution to Laplace\u2019s equation then the sum will also be a solution.\u00a0 Also, this will satisfy each of

the place of the initial condition in the heat equation problems that we solved a couple of sections ago.\u00a0 We will apply separation of variables to the each problem and find a product solution

boundary condition to determine the value of the constant(s) that are left in the problem.\u00a0 The process is nearly identical in many ways to what we did when we were solving the heat

...\u00a0...However, this   is not really suited for dealing with the ...\u00a0boundary condition.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s also notice that the following is   also a solution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...You should   verify this by plugging this into the differential equation and checking that   it is in fact a solution.\u00a0 Applying the   lone boundary condition to this \u201cshifted\u201d solution gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The solution to   the first differential equation is now,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and this is all   the farther we can go with this because we only had a single boundary   condition.\u00a0 That is not really a   problem however because we now have enough information to form the product   solution for this partial differential equation....\u00a0...A product   solution for this partial differential equation is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The Principle   of Superposition then tells us that a solution to the partial differential   equation is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and this   solution will satisfy the three homogeneous boundary conditions....\u00a0...To determine   the constants all we need to do is apply the final boundary condition....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, in the   previous problems we\u2019ve done this has clearly been a Fourier series of some   kind and in fact it still is.\u00a0 The   difference here is that the coefficients of the Fourier sine series are now,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...instead of just   ....\u00a0 We might be a little more tempted to use   the orthogonality of the sines to derive formulas for the ...,   however we can still reuse the work that we\u2019ve done previously to get   formulas for the coefficients here....\u00a0...Remember that a   Fourier sine series is just a series of coefficients (depending on ...) times a sine.\u00a0 We still have that here, except the   \u201ccoefficients\u201d are a little messier this time that what we saw when we first   dealt with Fourier series.\u00a0 So, the   coefficients can be found using exactly the same formula from the ... section of a function on   ...\u00a0we just need to be careful with the   coefficients.\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The formulas   for the ...\u00a0are a little messy this time in comparison   to the other problems we\u2019ve done but they aren\u2019t really all that messy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s do one of the other problems here so we can make a couple of points....\u00a0...Find   a solution to the following partial differential equation....Okay, for the first time we\u2019ve hit a problem where we   haven\u2019t previous done the separation of variables so let\u2019s go through   that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll assume the solution is in   the form,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll apply   this to the homogeneous boundary conditions first since we\u2019ll need those once   we get reach the point of choosing the separation constant.\u00a0 We\u2019ll let you verify that the boundary   conditions become,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, we\u2019ll   plug the product solution into the differential equation....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, at this   point we need to choose a separation constant.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got two homogeneous boundary   conditions on ... so let\u2019s choose the   constant so that the differential equation for ... yields a familiar boundary value problem so we don\u2019t need to   redo any of that work.\u00a0 In this case,   unlike the ...\u00a0..., we\u2019ll need .......\u00a0...This is a good   problem in that is clearly illustrates that sometimes you need ...\u00a0as a separation constant and at other times   you need ....\u00a0 Not only that but sometimes all it takes is   a small change in the boundary conditions it force the change....\u00a0...So, after   adding in the separation constant we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and two   ordinary differential equations that we get from this case (along with their   boundary conditions) are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, as we   noted above when we were deciding which separation constant to work with   we\u2019ve already solved the first boundary value problem.\u00a0 So, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for   the first boundary value problem are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The second   differential equation is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Because the   coefficient of the ...\u00a0is positive we know that a solution to this   is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case,   unlike the previous example, we won\u2019t need to use a shifted version of the   solution because this will work just fine with the boundary condition we\u2019ve   got for this.\u00a0 So, applying the   boundary condition to this gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and this   solution becomes,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The product   solution for this case is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The solution to   this partial differential equation is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s apply the nonhomogeneous boundary condition   to get the coefficients for this solution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As we\u2019ve come   to expect this is again a Fourier sine (although it won\u2019t always be a sine)   series and so using previously done work instead of using the orthogonality   of the sines to we see that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve worked two of the four cases that would need to be solved in order to completely solve ....\u00a0 As we\u2019ve seen each case was very similar and yet also had some differences.\u00a0 We saw the use of both separation constants and that sometimes we need to use a \u201cshifted\u201d solution in order to deal with one of the boundary conditions....\u00a0...Before moving on let\u2019s note that we used prescribed temperature boundary conditions here, but we could just have easily used prescribed flux boundary conditions or a mix of the two.\u00a0 No matter what kind of boundary conditions we have they will work the same....\u00a0...As a final example in this section let\u2019s take a look at solving Laplace\u2019s equation on a disk of radius ... and a prescribed temperature on the boundary.\u00a0 Because we are now on a disk it makes sense that we should probably do this problem in polar coordinates and so the first thing we need to so do is write down Laplace\u2019s equation in terms of polar coordinates....\u00a0...Laplace\u2019s equation in terms of polar coordinates is,...\u00a0...Okay, this is a lot more complicated than the Cartesian form of Laplace\u2019s equation and it will add in a few complexities to the solution process, but it isn\u2019t as bad as it looks.\u00a0 The main problem that we\u2019ve got here really is that fact that we\u2019ve got a single boundary condition.\u00a0 Namely,...\u00a0...This specifies the temperature on the boundary of the disk.\u00a0 We are clearly going to need three more conditions however since we\u2019ve got a 2... derivative in both ... and ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...When we solved Laplace\u2019s equation on a rectangle we used conditions at the end points of the range of each variable and so it makes some sense here that we should probably need the same kind of conditions here as well.\u00a0 The range on our variables here are,...\u00a0...Note that the limits on ...\u00a0are somewhat arbitrary here and are chosen for convenience here.\u00a0 Any set of limits that covers the complete disk will work, however as we\u2019ll see with these limits we will get another familiar boundary value problem arising.\u00a0 The best choice here is often not known until the separation of variables is done.\u00a0 At that point you can go back and make your choices....\u00a0...Okay, we now need conditions for ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 First, note that Laplace\u2019s equation in terms of polar coordinates is singular at ...\u00a0(... we get division by zero).\u00a0 However, we know from physical considerations that the temperature must remain finite everywhere in the disk and so let\u2019s impose the condition that,...\u00a0...This may seem like an odd condition and it definitely doesn\u2019t conform to the other boundary conditions that we\u2019ve seen to this point, but it will work out for us as we\u2019ll see....\u00a0...Now, for boundary conditions for ...\u00a0we\u2019ll do something similar to what we did for the 1-D head equation on a ....\u00a0 The two limits on ...\u00a0are really just different sides of a line in the disk and so let\u2019s use the periodic conditions there.\u00a0 In other

quite as messy as when we were working on a rectangle above.\u00a0 We could once again use the orthogonality   of the sines and cosines to derive formulas for the ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0or we could

this example most of the separation of variable problems tended to look very similar and it is easy to fall in to the trap of expecting everything to look like what we\u2019d seen earlier.\u00a0 With this example we can see that the problems can definitely be different on occasion so don\u2019t get too locked into expecting them to always work in exactly the same way....\u00a0...Before we leave this section let\u2019s briefly talk about what you\u2019d need to do on a partial disk.\u00a0 The periodic boundary conditions above were only there because we had a whole disk.\u00a0 What if we only had a disk between say .... ...\u00a0...When we\u2019ve got a partial disk we now have two new boundaries that we not present in the whole disk and the periodic boundary conditions will no longer make sense.\u00a0 The periodic boundary conditions are only used when we have the two \u201cboundaries\u201d in contact with each other and that clearly won\u2019t be the case with a partial disk....\u00a0...So, if we stick with prescribed temperature boundary conditions we would then have the following conditions...\u00a0...Also note that in order to use separation of variables on these conditions we\u2019d need to have ...\u00a0to make sure they are homogeneous....\u00a0...As a final note we could just have easily used flux boundary conditions for the last two if we\u2019d wanted to.\u00a0 The boundary value problem would be different, but outside of that the problem would work in the same manner....\u00a0...We could also use a flux condition on the ...\u00a0boundary but we haven\u2019t really talked yet about how to apply that kind of condition to our solution.\u00a0 Recall that this is the condition that we apply to our solution to determine the coefficients.\u00a0 It\u2019s not difficult to use we just haven\u2019t talked about this kind of condition yet.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be doing that in the next section.", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Okay, it is finally time to at least start discussing one of the more common methods for solving basic partial differential equations.\u00a0 The method of ... cannot always be used and even when it can be used it will not always be possible to get much past the first step in the method.\u00a0 However, it can be used to easily solve the 1-D ... with no sources, the 1-D ..., and the 2-D version of Laplace\u2019s Equation, .......\u00a0...In order to use the method of separation of variables we must be working with a linear homogenous partial differential equations with linear homogeneous boundary conditions.\u00a0 At this point we\u2019re not going to worry about the initial condition(s) because the solution that we initially get will rarely satisfy the initial condition(s).\u00a0 As we\u2019ll see however there are ways to generate a solution that will satisfy initial condition(s) provided they meet some fairly simple requirements....\u00a0...The method of separation of variables relies upon the assumption that a function of the form,...will be a solution to a linear homogeneous partial differential equation in ... and ....\u00a0 This is called a ... and provided the boundary conditions are also linear and homogeneous this will also satisfy the boundary conditions.\u00a0 However, as noted above this will only rarely satisfy the initial condition, but that is something for us to worry about in the next section....\u00a0...Now, before we get started on some examples there is probably a question that we should ask at this point and that is : Why?\u00a0 Why did we choose this solution and how do we know that it will work?\u00a0 This seems like a very strange assumption to make.\u00a0 After all there really isn\u2019t any reason to believe that a solution to a partial differential equation will in fact be a product of a function of only ...\u2019s and a function of only ...\u2019s.\u00a0 This seems more like a hope than a good assumption/guess....\u00a0...Unfortunately the best answer is that we chose it because it will work.\u00a0 As we\u2019ll see it works because it will reduce our partial differential equation down to two ordinary differential equations and provided we can solve those then we\u2019re in business and the method will allow us to get a solution to the partial differential equations....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s do a couple of examples to see how this method will reduce a partial differential equation down to two ordinary differential equations....\u00a0...Use   Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation....So, we have the heat equation with no sources, fixed   temperature boundary conditions (that are also homogeneous) and an initial   condition.\u00a0 The initial condition is   only here because it belongs here, but we will be ignoring it until we get to   the next section....\u00a0...The method of separation of variables tells us to assume   that the solution will take the form of the product,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

get....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As shown above we can factor the ...\u00a0out of the time derivative and we can factor   the ...\u00a0out of the spatial derivative.\u00a0 Also notice that after we\u2019ve factored these   out we no longer have a partial derivative left in the problem.\u00a0 In the time derivative we are now   differentiating only ...\u00a0with respect to ... and this is now an ordinary derivative.\u00a0 Likewise, in the spatial derivative we are   now only differentiating ...\u00a0with respect to ... and so we again have an ordinary derivative....\u00a0...At this point it probably doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019ve done much   to simplify the problem.\u00a0 However, just   the fact that we\u2019ve gotten the partial derivatives down to ordinary   derivatives is liable to be good thing even if it still looks like we\u2019ve got   a mess to deal with....\u00a0...Speaking of that apparent (and yes I said apparent) mess,   is it really the mess that it looks like?\u00a0   The idea is to eventually get all the ...\u2019s on one side of the equation and all the ...\u2019s on the other side.\u00a0 In   other words we want to \u201cseparate the variables\u201d and hence the name of the   method.\u00a0 In this case let\u2019s notice that   if we divide both sides by ...\u00a0we get want we want and we should point out   that it won\u2019t always be as easy as just dividing by the product   solution.\u00a0 So, dividing out gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that we   also divided both sides by ....\u00a0 This was done only for convenience down the   road.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t have to be done and   nicely enough if it turns out to be a bad idea we can always come back to   this step and put it back on the right side.\u00a0   Likewise, if we don\u2019t do it and it turns out to maybe not be such a   bad thing we can always come back and divide it out.\u00a0 For the time being however, please accept   our word that this was a good thing to do for this problem.\u00a0 We will discuss the reasoning for this after   we\u2019re done with this example....\u00a0...Now, while we   said that this is what we wanted it still seems like we\u2019ve got a mess.\u00a0 Notice however that the left side is a   function of only ... and the right   side is a function only of ... as we   wanted.\u00a0 Also notice these two   functions must be equal....\u00a0...Let\u2019s think   about this for a minute.\u00a0 How is it   possible that a function of only ...\u2019s   can be equal to a function of only ...\u2019s   regardless of the choice of ...   and/or ... that we have?\u00a0 This may seem like an impossibility until   you realize that there is one way that this can be true.\u00a0 If both functions (... both sides of the equation) were in fact constant and not   only a constant, but the same constant then they can in fact be equal....\u00a0...So, we must   have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...where the ...\u00a0is called the ... and is arbitrary....\u00a0...The next   question that we should now address is why the minus sign?\u00a0 Again, much like the dividing out the ... above, the answer is because it will   be convenient down the road to have chosen this.\u00a0 The minus sign doesn\u2019t have to be there and   in fact there are times when we don\u2019t want it there....\u00a0...So how do we   know it should be there or not?\u00a0 The   answer to that is to proceed to the next step in the process (which we\u2019ll see   in the next section) and at that point we\u2019ll know if would be convenient to   have it or not and we can come back to this step and add it in or take it our   depending what we chose to do here....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s   proceed with the process.\u00a0 The next   step is to acknowledge that we can take the equation above and split it into   the following two ordinary differential equations....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Both of these are very simple differential equations,   however because we don\u2019t know what ...\u00a0is we actually can\u2019t solve the spatial one   yet.\u00a0 The time equation however could   be solved at this point if we wanted to, although that won\u2019t always be the   case.\u00a0 At this point we don\u2019t want to   actually think about solving either of these yet however....\u00a0...The last step in the process that we\u2019ll be doing in this   section is to also make sure that our product solution, ...,   satisfies the boundary conditions so let\u2019s plug it into both of those....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s consider   the first one for a second.\u00a0 We have   two options here.\u00a0 Either ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0for every ....\u00a0 However, if we have ...\u00a0for every ... then we\u2019ll also have ...,   ... the trivial solution, and as   we discussed in the previous section this is definitely a solution to any   linear homogeneous equation we would really like a non-trivial solution....\u00a0...Therefore we   will assume that in fact we must have ....\u00a0 Likewise, from the second boundary   condition we will get ...\u00a0to avoid the trivial solution.\u00a0 Note as well that we were only able to   reduce the boundary conditions down like this because they were homogeneous.\u00a0 Had they not been homogeneous we could not   have done this....\u00a0...So, after applying separation of variables to the given   partial differential equation we arrive at a 1... order   differential equation that we\u2019ll need to solve for ...\u00a0and a 2... order boundary value   problem that we\u2019ll need to solve for ....\u00a0 The point of this section however is just   to get to this point and we\u2019ll hold off solving these until the next section....\u00a0...Let\u2019s summarize everything up that we\u2019ve determined here....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and note that   we don\u2019t have a condition for the time differential equation and is not a   problem.\u00a0 Also note that we rewrote the   second one a little....\u00a0...Okay, so just what have we learned here?\u00a0 By using separation of variables we were able to reduce our linear homogeneous partial differential equation with linear homogeneous boundary conditions down to an ordinary differential equation for one of the functions in our product solution ..., ...\u00a0in this case, and a boundary value problem that we can solve for the other function, ...\u00a0in this case....\u00a0...Note as well that the boundary value problem is in fact an eigenvalue/eigenfunction problem.\u00a0 When we solve the boundary value problem we will be identifying the eigenvalues, ..., that will generate non-trivial solutions to their corresponding eigenfunctions.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, we\u2019ll look into this more in the next section.\u00a0 At this point all we want to do is identify the two ordinary differential equations that we need to solve to get a solution....\u00a0...Before we do a couple of other examples we should take a second to address the fact that we made two very arbitrary seeming decisions in the above work.\u00a0 We divided both sides of the equation by ... at one point and chose to use ...\u00a0instead of ...\u00a0as the separation constant.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Both of these decisions were made to simplify the solution to the boundary value problem we got from our work.\u00a0 The addition of the ... in the boundary value problem would just have complicated the solution process with another letter we\u2019d have to keep track of so we moved it into the time problem where it won\u2019t cause as many problems in the solution process.\u00a0 Likewise, we chose ...\u00a0because we\u2019ve already solved that particular boundary value problem (albeit with a specific ..., but the work will be nearly identical) when we first ... at finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\u00a0\u00a0 This by the way was the reason we rewrote the boundary value problem to make it a little clearer that we have in fact solved this one already....\u00a0...We can now at least partially answer the question of how do we know to make these decisions.\u00a0 We wait until we get the ordinary differential equations and then look at them and decide of moving things like the ... or which separation constant to use based on how it will affect the solution of the ordinary differential equations.\u00a0 There is also, of course, a fair amount of experience that comes into play at this stage.\u00a0 The more experience you have in solving these the easier it often is to make these decisions....\u00a0...Again, we need to make clear here that we\u2019re not going to go any farther in this section than getting things down to the two ordinary differential equations.\u00a0 Of course we will need to solve them in order to get a solution to the partial differential equation but that is the topic of the remaining sections in this chapter.\u00a0 All we\u2019ll say about it here is that we will need to first solve the boundary value problem, which will tell us what ...\u00a0must be and then we can solve the other differential equation.\u00a0 Once that is done we can then turn our attention to the initial condition....\u00a0...Okay, we need to work a couple of other examples and these will go a lot quicker because we won\u2019t need to put in all the explanations.\u00a0 After the first example this process always seems like a very long process but it really isn\u2019t.\u00a0 It just looked that way because of all the explanation that we had to put into it....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start off with a couple of more examples with the heat equation using different boundary conditions....\u00a0...Use   Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation....In this case we\u2019re looking at the heat equation with no   sources and perfectly insulated boundaries....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ll start off by again assuming that our product   solution will have the form,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and because the   differential equation itself hasn\u2019t changed here we will get the same result   from plugging this in as we did in the previous example so the two ordinary   differential equations that we\u2019ll need to solve are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, the point   of this example was really to deal with the boundary conditions so let\u2019s plug   the product solution into them to get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, just as   with the first example if we want to avoid the trivial solution and so we   can\u2019t have ...\u00a0for every ... and so we must have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a summary of what we get by applying separation of   variables to this problem....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s see what we get if use periodic boundary conditions with the heat equation....\u00a0...Use   Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation....First note that these boundary conditions really are   homogeneous boundary conditions.\u00a0 If we   rewrite them as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...it\u2019s a little   easier to see....\u00a0...Now, again we\u2019ve done this partial differential equation   so we\u2019ll start off with,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and the two   ordinary differential equations that we\u2019ll need to solve are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Plugging the   product solution into the rewritten boundary conditions gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and we can see   that we\u2019ll only get non-trivial solution if,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, here is what we get by applying separation of   variables to this problem....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a look at what we get by applying separation of variables to the wave equation with fixed boundaries....\u00a0...Use   Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation....Now, as with the heat equation the two initial conditions   are here only because they need to be here for the problem.\u00a0 We will not actually be doing anything with   them here and as mentioned previously the product solution will rarely   satisfy them.\u00a0 We will be dealing with   those in a later ... when we actually   go past this first step.\u00a0 Again, the   point of this example is only to get down to the two ordinary differential   equations that separation of variables gives....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get going on that and plug the product solution,   ...\u00a0(we switched the ... to an ... here to avoid   confusion with the ... in the second   initial condition) into the wave equation to get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we moved the ...\u00a0to the right side for the same reason we   moved the ... in the heat equation.\u00a0 It will make solving the boundary value   problem a little easier.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve gotten the equation separated into a   function of only ... on the left and   a function of only ... on the right   we can introduce a separation constant and again we\u2019ll use ...\u00a0so we can arrive at a boundary value problem   that we are familiar with.\u00a0 So, after   introducing the separation constant we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...   The two ordinary differential equations we get are then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The boundary conditions in this example are identical to   those from the first example and so plugging the product solution into the   boundary conditions gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying separation of variables to this problem gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s take a look at the 2-D Laplace\u2019s Equation....\u00a0...Use   Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation....This problem is a little (well actually quite a bit in   some ways) different from the heat and wave equations.\u00a0 First, we no longer really have a time   variable in the equation but instead we usually consider both variables to be   spatial variables and we\u2019ll be assuming that the two variables are in the   ranges shown above in the problems statement.\u00a0   Note that this also means that we no longer have initial conditions,   but instead we now have two sets of boundary conditions, one for ... and one for .......\u00a0...Also, we should point out that we have three of the   boundary conditions homogeneous and one nonhomogeneous for a reason.\u00a0 When we get around to actually solving this   Laplace\u2019s Equation we\u2019ll see that this is in fact required in order for us to   find a solution....\u00a0...For this problem we\u2019ll use the product solution,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It will often   be convenient to have the boundary conditions in hand that this product   solution gives before we take care of the differential equation.\u00a0 In this case we have three homogeneous   boundary conditions and so we\u2019ll need to convert all of them.\u00a0 Because we\u2019ve already converted these kind   of boundary conditions we\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that these will   become,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Plugging this   into the differential equation and separating

eigenvalue/eigenfunction problem as we pointed out in the discussion   after the first example.\u00a0 However, in   order to solve it we need two boundary conditions.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, for our   problem here we can see that we\u2019ve got two boundary conditions for ...\u00a0but only one for ...\u00a0and so we can see that the boundary value   problem that we\u2019ll have to solve will involve ...\u00a0and so we need to pick a separation constant   that will give use the boundary value problem we\u2019ve already solved.\u00a0 In this case that means that we need to   choose ...\u00a0for the separation constant.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not sure you believe that yet   hold on for a second and you\u2019ll soon see that it was in fact the correct   choice here....\u00a0...Putting the   separation constant gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The two ordinary   differential equations we get from Laplace\u2019s Equation are then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We can now see   that the second one does now look like one we\u2019ve already solved (with a small   change in letters of course, but that really doesn\u2019t change things)....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s summarize up here. ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve finally seen an example where the constant of separation didn\u2019t have a minus sign and again note that we chose it so that the boundary value problem we need to solve will match one we\u2019ve already seen how to solve so there won\u2019t be much work to there....\u00a0...All the examples worked in this section to this point are all problems that we\u2019ll continue in later sections to get full solutions for.\u00a0 Let\u2019s work one more however to illustrate a couple of other ideas.\u00a0 We will not however be doing any work with this in later sections however, it is only here to illustrate a couple of points....\u00a0...Use   Separation of Variables on the following partial differential equation....Note that this is a heat equation with the source term of ...\u00a0and is both linear and homogenous.\u00a0 Also note that for the first time we\u2019ve   mixed boundary condition types.\u00a0 At ...\u00a0we\u2019ve got a prescribed temperature and at ...\u00a0we\u2019ve got a Newton\u2019s law of cooling type   boundary condition.\u00a0 We should not come   away from the first few examples with the idea that the boundary conditions   at both boundaries always the same type.\u00a0   Having them the same type just makes the boundary value problem a   little easier to solve in many cases....\u00a0...So we\u2019ll start off with,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and plugging   this into the partial differential equation gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, the next   step is to divide by ...\u00a0and notice that upon doing that the second   term on the right will become a one and so can go on either side.\u00a0 Theoretically there is no reason that the   one can\u2019t be on either side, however from a practical standpoint we again   want to keep things a simple as possible so we\u2019ll move it to the ... side as this will guarantee that   we\u2019ll get a differential equation for the boundary value problem that we\u2019ve   seen before....\u00a0...So, separating   and introducing a separation constant gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

rewriting),...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s deal   with the boundary conditions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and we

...\u00a0...So, here is what we get by applying separation of   variables to this problem....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...On a quick side note we solved the boundary value problem in this example in ... of the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions section and that example illustrates why separation of variables is not always so easy to use.\u00a0 As we\u2019ll see in the next section to get a solution that will satisfy any sufficiently nice initial condition we really need to get our hands on all the eigenvalues for the boundary value problem.\u00a0 However, as the solution to this boundary value problem shows this is not always possible to do.\u00a0 There are ways (which we won\u2019t be going into here) to use the information here to at least get approximations to the solution but we won\u2019t ever be able to get a complete solution to this problem....\u00a0...Okay, that\u2019s it for this section.\u00a0 It is important to remember at this point that what we\u2019ve done here is really only the first step in the separation of variables method for solving partial differential equations.\u00a0 In the upcoming sections we\u2019ll be looking at what we need to do to finish out the solution process and in those sections we\u2019ll finish the solution to the partial differential equations we started in Example 1 ...\u00a0Example 5 above....\u00a0...Also, in the ... section the last two examples show pretty much the whole separation of variable process from defining the product solution to getting an actual solution.\u00a0 The only step that\u2019s missing from those two examples is the solving of a boundary value problem that will have been already solved at that point and so was not put into the solution given that they tend to be fairly lengthy to solve....\u00a0...We\u2019ll also see a worked example (without the boundary value problem work again) in the ... section.", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Before we get into actually solving partial differential equations and before we even start discussing the method of separation of variables we want to spend a little bit of time talking about the two main partial differential equations that we\u2019ll be solving later on in the chapter.\u00a0 We\u2019ll look at the first one in this section and the second one in the next section....\u00a0...The first partial differential equation that we\u2019ll be looking at once we get started with solving will be the heat equation, which governs the temperature distribution in an object.\u00a0 We are going to give several forms of the heat equation for reference purposes, but we will only be really solving one of them....\u00a0...We will start out by considering the temperature in a 1-D bar of length ....\u00a0 What this means is that we are going to assume that the bar starts off at ...\u00a0and ends when we reach ....\u00a0 We are also going to so assume that at any location, ... the temperature will be constant an every point in the cross section at that ....\u00a0 In other words, temperature will only vary in ... and we can hence consider the bar to be a 1-D bar.\u00a0 Note that with this assumption the actual shape of the cross section (... circular, rectangular, ...) doesn\u2019t matter....\u00a0...Note that the 1-D assumption is actually not all that bad of an assumption as it might seem at first glance.\u00a0 If we assume that the lateral surface of the bar is perfectly insulated (... no heat can flow through the lateral surface) then the only way heat can enter or leave the bar as at either end.\u00a0 This means that heat can only flow from left to right or right to left and thus creating a 1-D temperature distribution.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The assumption of the lateral surfaces being perfectly insulated is of course impossible, but it is possible to put enough insulation on the lateral surfaces that there will be very little heat flow through them and so, at least for a time, we can consider the lateral surfaces to be perfectly insulated....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s now get some definitions out of the way before we write down the first form of the heat equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...We should probably make a couple of comments about some of these quantities before proceeding.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The specific heat, ..., of a material is the amount of heat energy that it takes to raise one unit of mass of the material by one unit of temperature.\u00a0 As indicated we are going to assume, at least initially, that the specific heat may not be uniform throughout the bar.\u00a0 Note as well that in practice the specific heat depends upon the temperature.\u00a0 However, this will generally only be an issue for large temperature differences (which in turn depends on the material the bar is made out of) and so we\u2019re going to assume for the purposes of this discussion that the temperature differences are not large enough to affect our solution....\u00a0...The mass density, ..., is the mass per unit volume of the material.\u00a0 As with the specific heat we\u2019re going to initially assume that the mass density may not be uniform throughout the bar....\u00a0...The heat flux, ..., is the amount of thermal energy that flows to the right per unit surface area per unit time.\u00a0 The \u201cflows to the right\u201d bit simply tells us that if ...\u00a0for some ... and ... then the heat is flowing to the right at that point and time.\u00a0 Likewise if ...\u00a0then the heat will be flowing to the left at that point and time....\u00a0...The final quantity we defined above is ... ...\u00a0and this is used to represent any external sources or sinks (... heat energy taken out of the system) of heat energy.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0then heat energy is being added to the system at that location and time and if ...\u00a0then heat energy is being removed from the system at that location and time....\u00a0...With these quantities the heat equation is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...While this is a nice form of the heat equation it is not actually something we can solve.\u00a0 In this form there are two unknown functions, ... and ..., and so we need to get rid of one of them.\u00a0 With ... we can easily remove the heat flux from this equation....\u00a0...Fourier\u2019s law states that,...where ...\u00a0is the ... of the material and measures the ability of a given material to conduct heat.\u00a0 The better a material can conduct heat the larger ...\u00a0will be.\u00a0 As noted the thermal conductivity can vary with the location in the bar.\u00a0 Also, much like the specific heat the thermal conductivity can vary with temperature, but we will assume that the total temperature change is not so great that this will be an issue and so we will assume for the purposes here that the thermal conductivity will not vary with temperature....\u00a0...Fourier\u2019s law does a very good job of modeling what we know to be true about heat flow.\u00a0 First, we know that if the temperature in a region is constant, ..., then there is no heat flow.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, we know that if there is a temperature difference in a region we know the heat will flow from the hot portion to the cold portion of the region.\u00a0 For example, if it is hotter to the right then we know that the heat should flow to the left.\u00a0 When it is hotter to the right then we also know that ...\u00a0(... the temperature increases as we move to the right) and so we\u2019ll have ...\u00a0and so the heat will flow to the left as it should.\u00a0 Likewise, if ...\u00a0(... it is hotter to the left) then we\u2019ll have ...\u00a0and heat will flow to the right as it should....\u00a0...Finally, the greater the temperature difference in a region (... the larger ...\u00a0is) then the greater the heat flow....\u00a0...So, if we plug Fourier\u2019s law into ..., we get the following form of the heat equation,...\u00a0...Note that we factored the minus sign out of the derivative to cancel against the minus sign that was already there.\u00a0 We cannot however, factor the thermal conductivity out of the derivative since it is a function of ... and the derivative is with respect to .......\u00a0...Solving ... is quite difficult due to the non uniform nature of the thermal properties and the mass density.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s now assume that these properties are all constant, ...,...where ..., ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are now all fixed quantities.\u00a0 In this case we generally say that the material in the bar is ....\u00a0 Under these assumptions the heat equation becomes,...\u00a0...For a final simplification to the heat equation let\u2019s divide both sides by ...\u00a0and define the ... to be,...\u00a0...The heat equation is then,...\u00a0...To most people this is what they mean when they talk about the heat equation and in fact it will be the equation that we\u2019ll be solving.\u00a0 Well, actually we\u2019ll be solving ... with no external sources, ..., but we\u2019ll be considering this form when we start discussing separation of variables in a couple of sections.\u00a0 We\u2019ll only drop the sources term when we actually start solving the heat equation....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve got the 1-D heat equation taken care of we need to move into the initial and boundary conditions we\u2019ll also need in order to solve the problem.\u00a0 If you go back to any of our solutions of ordinary differential equations that we\u2019ve done in previous sections you can see that the number of conditions required always matched the highest order of the derivative in the equation.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In partial differential equations the same idea holds except now we have to pay attention to the variable we\u2019re differentiating with respect to as well.\u00a0 So, for the heat equation we\u2019ve got a first order time derivative and so we\u2019ll need one initial condition and a second order spatial derivative and so we\u2019ll need two boundary conditions....\u00a0...The initial condition that we\u2019ll use here is,...and we don\u2019t really need to say much about it here other than to note that this just tells us what the initial temperature distribution in the bar is....\u00a0...The boundary conditions will tell us something about what the temperature and/or heat flow is doing at the boundaries of the bar.\u00a0 There are four of them that are fairly common boundary conditions....\u00a0...The first type of boundary conditions that we can have would be the ... boundary conditions, also called ....\u00a0 The prescribed temperature boundary conditions are,...\u00a0...The next type of boundary conditions are ..., also called ....\u00a0 Using Fourier\u2019s law these can be written as,...\u00a0...If either of the boundaries are ... ... there is no heat flow out of them then these boundary conditions reduce to,...and note that we will often just call these particular boundary conditions ... boundaries and drop the \u201cperfectly\u201d part....\u00a0...The third type of boundary conditions use ... and are sometimes called ....\u00a0 These are usually used when the bar is in a moving fluid and note we can consider air to be a fluid for this purpose.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here are the equations for this kind of boundary condition....where ... is a positive quantity that is experimentally determined and ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0give the temperature of the surrounding fluid at the respective boundaries....\u00a0...Note that the two conditions do vary slightly depending on which boundary we are at.\u00a0 At ...\u00a0we have a minus sign on the right side while we don\u2019t at ....\u00a0 To see why this is let\u2019s first assume that at ...\u00a0we have ....\u00a0 In other words the bar is hotter than the surrounding fluid and so at ...\u00a0the heat flow (as given by the left side of the equation) must be to the left, or negative since the heat will flow from the hotter bar into the cooler surrounding liquid.\u00a0 If the heat flow is negative then we need to have a minus sign on the right side of the equation to make sure that it has the proper sign....\u00a0...If the bar is cooler than the surrounding fluid at ..., ... ...\u00a0we can make a similar argument to justify the minus sign.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify this....\u00a0...If we now look at the other end, ..., and again assume that the bar is hotter than the surrounding fluid or, ....\u00a0 In this case the heat flow must be to the right, or be positive, and so in this case we can\u2019t have a minus sign.\u00a0 Finally, we\u2019ll again leave it to you to verify that we can\u2019t have the minus sign at ...\u00a0is the bar is cooler than the surrounding fluid as well....\u00a0...Note that we are not actually going to be looking at any of these kinds of boundary conditions here.\u00a0 These types of boundary conditions tend to lead to boundary value problems such as ... in the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions section of the previous chapter.\u00a0 As we saw in that example it is often very difficult to get our hands on the eigenvalues and as we\u2019ll eventually see we will need them.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It is important to note at this point that we can also mix and match these boundary conditions so to speak.\u00a0 There is nothing wrong with having a prescribed temperature at one boundary and a prescribed flux at the other boundary for example so don\u2019t always expect the same boundary condition to show up at both ends.\u00a0 This warning is more important that it might seem at this point because once we get into solving the heat equation we are going to have the same kind of condition on each end to simplify the problem somewhat....\u00a0...The final type of boundary conditions that we\u2019ll need here are ...boundary conditions.\u00a0 Periodic boundary conditions are,...\u00a0...Note that for these kinds of boundary conditions the left boundary tends to be ...\u00a0instead of ...\u00a0as we were using in the previous types of boundary conditions.\u00a0 The periodic boundary conditions will arise very naturally from a couple of particular geometries that we\u2019ll be looking at down the road....\u00a0...We will now close out this section with a quick look at the 2-D and 3-D version of the heat equation.\u00a0 However, before we jump into that we need to introduce a little bit of notation first.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The ... operator is defined to be,...depending on whether we are in 2 or 3 dimensions.\u00a0 Think of the del operator as a function that takes functions as arguments (instead of numbers as we\u2019re used to).\u00a0 Whatever function we \u201cplug\u201d into the operator gets put into the partial derivatives....\u00a0...So, for example in 3-D we would have,...This of course is also the gradient of the function .......\u00a0...The del operator also allows us to quickly write down the divergence of a function.\u00a0 So, again using 3-D as an example the divergence of ...\u00a0can be written as the dot product of the del operator and the function.\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...Finally, we will also see the following show up in the our work,...\u00a0...This is usually denoted as,...and is called the ....\u00a0 The 2-D version of course simply doesn\u2019t have the third term....\u00a0...Okay, we can now look into the 2-D and 3-D version of the heat equation and where ever the del operator and or Laplacian appears assume that it is the appropriate dimensional version....\u00a0...The higher dimensional version of ... is,...and note that the specific heat, ..., and mass density, ..., are may not be uniform and so may be functions of the spatial variables.\u00a0 Likewise, the external sources term, ..., may also be a function of both the spatial variables and time....\u00a0...Next, the higher dimensional version of Fourier\u2019s law is,...where the thermal conductivity, ..., is again assumed to be a function of the spatial variables....\u00a0...If we plug this into ... we get the heat equation for a non uniform bar (... the thermal properties may be functions of the spatial variables) with external sources/sinks,...\u00a0...If we now assume that the specific heat, mass density and thermal conductivity are constant (... the bar is uniform) the heat equation becomes,...where we divided both sides by ...\u00a0to get the thermal diffusivity, ... in front of the Laplacian....\u00a0...The initial condition for the 2-D or 3-D heat equation is,...depending upon the dimension we\u2019re in....\u00a0...The prescribed temperature boundary condition becomes,...where ...\u00a0or ..., depending upon the dimension we\u2019re in, will range over the portion of the boundary in which we are prescribing the temperature....\u00a0...The prescribed heat flux condition becomes,...where the left side is only being evaluated at points along the boundary and ...\u00a0is the outward unit normal on the surface....\u00a0...Newton\u2019s law of cooling will become,...where ... is a positive quantity that is experimentally determine,\u00a0 ...\u00a0is the temperature of the fluid at the boundary and again it is assumed that this is only being evaluated at points along the boundary....\u00a0...We don\u2019t have periodic boundary conditions here as they will only arise from specific 1-D geometries....\u00a0...We should probably also acknowledge at this point that we\u2019ll not actually be solving ... at any point, but we will be solving a special case of it in the ... section.",

...and we plug   this into the partial differential equation and boundary conditions.\u00a0 We separate the equation to get a function   of only ... on one side and a   function of only ... on the other   side and then introduce a separation constant.\u00a0 This leaves us with two ordinary   differential equations....\u00a0...We did all of   this in ...   of the previous section and the two ordinary differential equations

have an   infinite number of possible values here....\u00a0...This is a   simple linear (and separable for that matter) 1... order   differential equation and so we\u2019ll let you verify that the

...\u00a0...Okay, now that   we\u2019ve gotten both of the ordinary differential equations solved we can   finally write down a solution.\u00a0 Note   however that we have in fact found infinitely many solutions since there are   infinitely many solutions (...   eigenfunctions) to the spatial problem....\u00a0...Our product   solution are then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ve denoted   the product solution ...\u00a0to acknowledge that each value of ... will yield a different   solution.\u00a0 Also note that we\u2019ve changed   the ... in the solution to the time   problem to ...\u00a0to denote the fact that it will probably be   different for each value of ... as   well and because had we kept the ...\u00a0with the eigenfunction we\u2019d have absorbed it   into the ... to get a single constant   in our solution....\u00a0...So, there we have it.\u00a0 The function above will satisfy the heat equation and the boundary condition of zero temperature on the ends of the bar.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The problem with this solution is that it simply will not satisfy almost every possible initial condition we could possibly want to use.\u00a0 That does not mean however, that there aren\u2019t at least a few that it will satisfy as the next example illustrates....\u00a0...Solve   the following heat problem for the given initial conditions.... This is   actually easier than it looks like.\u00a0   All we need to do is choose ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0in the product solution above to get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and we\u2019ve got   the solution we need.\u00a0 This is a   product solution for the first example and so satisfies the partial   differential equation and boundary conditions and will satisfy the initial   condition since plugging in ...\u00a0will drop out the exponential....\u00a0... This is almost as simple as the   first part.\u00a0 Recall from the ... that if we have two solutions to a linear homogeneous   differential equation (which we\u2019ve got here) then their sum is also a   solution.\u00a0 So, all we need to do is   choose ... and ...\u00a0as we did in the first part to get a   solution that satisfies each part of the initial condition and then add them   up.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave it   to you to verify that this does in fact satisfy the initial condition and the   boundary conditions....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve seen that our solution from the first example will satisfy at least a small number of highly specific initial conditions.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s extend the idea out that we used in the second part of the previous example a little to see how we can get a solution that will satisfy any sufficiently nice initial condition.\u00a0 The Principle of Superposition is, of course, not restricted to only two solutions.\u00a0 For instance the following is also a solution to the partial differential equation....and notice that this solution will not only satisfy the boundary conditions but it will also satisfy the initial condition,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s extend this out even further and take the limit as ....\u00a0 Doing this our solution now becomes,...\u00a0...This solution will satisfy any initial condition that can be written in the form,...\u00a0...This may still seem to be very restrictive, but the series on the right should look awful familiar to you after the previous chapter.\u00a0 The series on the left is exactly the ... we looked at in that chapter.\u00a0 Also recall that when we can write down the Fourier sine series for any ... function on .......\u00a0...So, provided our initial condition is piecewise smooth after applying the initial condition to our solution we can determine the ...\u00a0as if we were finding the Fourier sine series of initial condition.\u00a0 So we can either proceed as we did in that section and use the orthogonality of the sines to derive them or we can acknowledge that we\u2019ve already done that work and know that coefficients\u00a0 are given by,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we finally can completely solve a partial differential equation....\u00a0...Solve   the following BVP....There isn\u2019t really all that much to do here as we\u2019ve done   most of it in the examples and discussion above....\u00a0...First, the solution is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The   coefficients are given by,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If we plug these in we get the solution,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...That almost seems anti-climactic.\u00a0 This was a very short problem.\u00a0 Of course some of that came about because we had a really simple constant initial condition and so the integral was very simple.\u00a0 However, don\u2019t forget all the work that we had to put into discussing Fourier sine series, solving boundary value problems, applying separation of variables and then putting all of that together to reach this point....\u00a0...While the example itself was very simple, it was only simple because of all the work that we had to put into developing the ideas that even allowed us to do this.\u00a0 Because of how \u201csimple\u201d it will often be to actually get these solutions we\u2019re not actually going to do anymore with specific initial conditions.\u00a0 We will instead concentrate on simply developing the formulas that we\u2019d be required to evaluate in order to get an actual solution....\u00a0...So, having said that let\u2019s move onto the next example.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019re going to again look at the temperature distribution in a bar with ... boundaries.\u00a0 We are also no longer going to go in steps.\u00a0 We will do the full solution as a single example and end up with a solution that will satisfy any piecewise smooth initial condition....\u00a0...Find   a solution to the following partial differential equation....We applied separation of variables to this problem in ... of the   previous section. \u00a0So, after assuming   that our solution is in the form,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and applying   separation of variables we get the following two ordinary differential   equations that we need to solve....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We solved the   boundary value problem in ... of the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions section of the previous chapter   for ...\u00a0so as with the first example in this section   we\u2019re not going to put a lot of explanation into the work here.\u00a0 If you need a reminder on how this works go   back to the previous chapter and review the example we worked there.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get going on the three cases

...\u00a0...The last example that we\u2019re going to work in this section is a little different from the first two.\u00a0 We are going to consider the temperature distribution in a thin circular ring.\u00a0 We will consider the lateral surfaces to be perfectly insulated and we are also going to assume that the ring is thin enough so that the temperature does not vary with distance from the center of the ring....\u00a0...So, what does that leave us with?\u00a0 Let\u2019s set ...\u00a0as shown below and then let ... be the arc length of the ring as measured from this point.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will measure ... as positive if we move to the right and negative if we move to the left of ....\u00a0 This means that at the top of the ring we\u2019ll meet where ...\u00a0(if we move to the right) and ...\u00a0(if we move to the left).\u00a0 By doing this we can consider this ring to be a bar of length 2... and the heat equation that we ... earlier in this chapter will still hold....\u00a0...At the point of the ring we consider the two \u201cends\u201d to be in ....\u00a0 This means that at the two ends both the temperature and the heat flux must be equal.\u00a0 In other words we must have,...\u00a0...If you recall from the ... in which we derived the heat equation we called these periodic boundary conditions.\u00a0 So, the problem we need to solve to get the temperature distribution in this case is,...\u00a0...Find   a solution to the following partial differential equation....We applied separation of variables to this problem in ... of the   previous section. \u00a0So, if we assume the   solution is in the form,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

seen   with the previous two problems we\u2019ve already solved a boundary value problem   like this one back in the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions section of the   previous chapter, ... to   be exact with ....\u00a0 So, if you need a little more explanation   of what\u2019s going on here go back to this example and you can see a little more   explanation....\u00a0...We again have   three cases to deal with here....\u00a0...The general solution   to the differential equation is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying the   first boundary condition and recalling that cosine is an even function and   sine is an odd function gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...At this stage   we can\u2019t really say anything as either ...\u00a0or sine could be zero.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s apply the second boundary   condition and see what we get....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We get   something similar.\u00a0 However notice that   if ...\u00a0then we would be forced to have ...\u00a0and this would give us the trivial solution   which we don\u2019t want....\u00a0...This means   therefore that we must have ...\u00a0which in turn means (from work in our   previous examples) that the positive eigenvalues for this problem are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, there is   no reason to believe that ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 All we know is that they both can\u2019t be zero   and so that means that we in fact have two sets of eigenfunctions for this   problem corresponding to positive eigenvalues.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

We will start off with the convergence of a Fourier series and once we have that taken care of the convergence of Fourier Sine/Cosine series will follow as a direct consequence.\u00a0 Here then is the theorem giving the convergence of a Fourier series....\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a piecewise smooth on the interval ....\u00a0 The Fourier series of ...\u00a0will then converge to,...\u00a0...The first thing to note about this is that on the interval ...\u00a0both the function and the periodic extension are equal and so where the function is continuous on ...\u00a0the periodic extension will also be continuous and hence at these points the Fourier series will in fact converge to the function.\u00a0 The only points in the interval ...\u00a0where the Fourier series will not converge to the function is where the function has a jump discontinuity....\u00a0...Let\u2019s again consider ... of the previous section.\u00a0 In that section we found that the Fourier series of,...on ...to be,...\u00a0...We now know that in the intervals ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0the function and hence the periodic extension are both continuous and so on these two intervals the Fourier series will converge to the periodic extension and hence will converge to the function itself....\u00a0...At the point ...\u00a0the function has a jump discontinuity and so the periodic extension will also have a jump discontinuity at this point.\u00a0 That means that at ...\u00a0the Fourier series will converge to,...\u00a0...At the two endpoints of the interval, ...\u00a0and ..., we can see from the sketch of the periodic extension above that the periodic extension has a jump discontinuity here and so the Fourier series will not converge to the function there but instead the averages of the limits....\u00a0...So, at ...\u00a0the Fourier series will converge to,...and at ...\u00a0the Fourier series will converge to,...\u00a0...Now that we have addressed the convergence of a Fourier series we can briefly turn our attention to the convergence of Fourier sine/cosine series.\u00a0 First, as noted in the previous section the Fourier sine series of an odd function on ...\u00a0and the Fourier cosine series of an even function on ...\u00a0are both just special cases of a Fourier series we now know that both of these will have the same convergence as a Fourier series....\u00a0...Next, if we look at the Fourier sine series of any function, ..., on ...\u00a0then we know that this is just the Fourier series of the odd extension of ...\u00a0restricted down to the interval ....\u00a0 Therefore we know that the Fourier series will converge to the odd extension on ...\u00a0where it is continuous and the average of the limits where the odd extension has a jump discontinuity.\u00a0 However, on ...\u00a0we know that ...\u00a0and the odd extension are equal and so we can again see that the Fourier sine series will have the same convergence as the Fourier series....\u00a0...Likewise, we can go through a similar argument for the Fourier cosine series using even extensions to see that Fourier cosine series for a function on ...\u00a0will also have the same convergence as a Fourier series....\u00a0...The next topic that we want to briefly discuss here is when will a Fourier series be continuous.\u00a0 From the theorem on the convergence of Fourier series we know that where the function is continuous the Fourier series will converge to the function and hence be continuous at these points.\u00a0 The only places where the Fourier series may not be continuous is if there is a jump discontinuity on the interval ...\u00a0and potentially at the endpoints as we saw that the periodic extension may introduce a jump discontinuity there....\u00a0...So, if we\u2019re going to want the Fourier series to be continuous everywhere we\u2019ll need to make sure that the function does not have any discontinuities in ....\u00a0 Also, in order to avoid having the periodic extension introduce a jump discontinuity we\u2019ll need to require that ....\u00a0 By doing this the two ends of the graph will match up when we form the periodic extension and hence we will avoid a jump discontinuity at the end points....\u00a0...Here is a summary of these ideas for a Fourier series....\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a piecewise smooth on the interval ....\u00a0 The Fourier series of ...\u00a0will be continuous and will converge to ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0provided ...\u00a0is continuous on ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Now, how can we use this to get similar statements about Fourier sine/cosine series on ...?\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with a Fourier cosine series.\u00a0 The first thing that we do is form the even extension of ...\u00a0on ....\u00a0 For the purposes of this discussion let\u2019s call the even extension ...\u00a0\u00a0As we ... when we sketched several even extensions in the Fourier cosine series section that in order for the sketch to be the even extension of the function we must have both,...\u00a0...If one or both of these aren\u2019t true then ...\u00a0will not be an even extension of .......\u00a0...So, in forming the even extension we do not introduce any jump discontinuities at ...\u00a0and we get for free that ....\u00a0 If we now apply the above theorem to the even extension we see that the Fourier series of the even extension is continuous on ....\u00a0 However, because the even extension and the function itself are the same on ...\u00a0then the Fourier cosine series of ...\u00a0must also be continuous on .......\u00a0...Here is a summary of this discussion for the Fourier cosine series....\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a piecewise smooth on the interval ....\u00a0 The Fourier cosine series of ...\u00a0will be continuous and will converge to ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0provided ...\u00a0is continuous on .......\u00a0...Note that we don\u2019t need any requirements on the end points here because they are trivially satisfied when we convert over to the even extension....\u00a0...For a Fourier sine series we need to be a little more careful.\u00a0 Again, the first thing that we need to do is form the odd extension on ...\u00a0and let\u2019s call it ....\u00a0 We know that in order for it to be the odd extension then we know that at all points in ...\u00a0it must satisfy ...\u00a0and that is what can lead to problems....\u00a0...As we ... in the Fourier sine series section it is very easy to introduce a jump discontinuity at ...\u00a0when we form the odd extension.\u00a0 In fact, the only way to avoid forming a jump discontinuity at this point is to require that .......\u00a0...Next, the requirement that at the endpoints we must have ...\u00a0will practically guarantee that we\u2019ll introduce a jump discontinuity here as well when we form the odd extension.\u00a0 Again, the only way to avoid doing this is to require .......\u00a0...So, with these two requirements we will get an odd extension that is continuous and so we know that the Fourier series of the odd extension on ...\u00a0will be continuous and hence the Fourier sine series will be continuous on ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a summary of all this for the Fourier sine series. ...\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a piecewise smooth on the interval ....\u00a0 The Fourier sine series of ...\u00a0will be continuous and will converge to ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0provided ...\u00a0is continuous on ...,   ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...The next topic of discussion here is differentiation and integration of Fourier series.\u00a0 In particular we want to know if we can differentiate a Fourier series term by term and have the result be the Fourier series of the derivative of the function.\u00a0 Likewise we want to know if we can integrate a Fourier series term by term and arrive at the Fourier series of the integral of the function. ...\u00a0...Note that we\u2019ll not be doing much discussion of the details here.\u00a0 All we\u2019re really going to be doing is giving the theorems that govern the ideas here so that we can say we\u2019ve given them....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with the theorem for term by term differentiation of a Fourier series. ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Given a function ...\u00a0if the derivative, ...,   is piecewise smooth and the Fourier series of ...\u00a0is continuous then the Fourier series can be   differentiated term by term.\u00a0 The   result of the differentiation is the Fourier series of the derivative, .......\u00a0...One of the main condition of this theorem is that the Fourier series be continuous and from above we also know the conditions on the function that will give this.\u00a0 So, if we add this into the theorem to get this form of the theorem, ...\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a continuous function, its derivative ...\u00a0is piecewise smooth and ...\u00a0then the Fourier series of the function can   be differentiated term by term and the result is the Fourier series of the   derivative....\u00a0...For Fourier cosine/sine series the basic theorem is the same as for Fourier series.\u00a0 All that\u2019s required is that the Fourier cosine/sine series be continuous and then you can differentiate term by term.\u00a0 The theorems that we\u2019ll give here will merge the conditions for the Fourier cosine/sine series to be continuous into the theorem....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the Fourier cosine series. ...\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a continuous function and its derivative ...\u00a0is piecewise smooth then the Fourier cosine   series of the function can be differentiated term by term and the result is   the Fourier sine series of the derivative....\u00a0...Next the theorem for Fourier sine series. ...\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a continuous function, its derivative ...\u00a0is piecewise smooth, ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0then the Fourier sine series of the function   can be differentiated term by term and the result is the Fourier cosine   series of the derivative....\u00a0...The theorem for integration of Fourier series term by term is simple so there it is. ...\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is piecewise smooth then the Fourier sine   series of the function can be integrated term by term and the result is a   convergent infinite series that will converge to the integral of .......\u00a0...Note however that the new series that results from term by term integration may not be the Fourier series for the integral of the function.", "url":

example there is often quite a bit of work involved in computing the integrals involved here....\u00a0...The next couple of examples are here so we can make a nice observation about some Fourier series and their relation to Fourier sine/cosine series...\u00a0...Find   the Fourier series for ...\u00a0on .......Let\u2019s start with the integrals for

integrating an odd function (... is odd and cosine is even so the product is odd) over the   interval ...\u00a0and so we know that both of these integrals   will be zero....\u00a0...Next here is   the integral for ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case we\u2019re integrating an even function (... and sine are both odd so the product   is even) on the interval ...\u00a0and so we can \u201csimplify\u201d the integral as   shown above.\u00a0 The reason for doing this   here is not actually to simplify the integral however.\u00a0 It is instead done so that we can note that   we did this integral ... in the   Fourier sine series section and so don\u2019t need to redo it in this   section.\u00a0 Using the previous result we   get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case   the Fourier series is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...If you go back and take a look at ... in the Fourier sine series section, the same example we used to get the integral out of, you will see that in that example we were finding the Fourier sine series for\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0on ....\u00a0 The important thing to note here is that the answer that we got in that example is identical to the answer we got here....\u00a0...If you think about it however, this should not be too surprising. In both cases we were using an odd function on ...\u00a0and because we know that we had an odd function the coefficients of the cosines in the Fourier series, ..., will involve integrating and odd function over a symmetric interval, ..., and so will be zero.\u00a0 So, in these cases the Fourier sine series of an odd function on ...\u00a0is really just a special case of a Fourier series.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note however that when we moved over to doing the Fourier sine series of any function on ...\u00a0we should no longer expect to get the same results.\u00a0 You can see this by comparing Example 1 above with ... in the Fourier sine series section.\u00a0 In both examples we are finding the series for ...\u00a0and yet got very different answers. ...\u00a0...So, why did we get different answers in this case?\u00a0 Recall that when we find the Fourier sine series of a function on ...\u00a0we are really finding the Fourier sine series of the odd extension of the function on ...\u00a0and then just restricting the result down to ....\u00a0 For a Fourier series we are actually using the whole function on ...\u00a0instead of its odd extension.\u00a0 We should therefore not expect to get the same results since we are really using different functions (at least on part of the interval) in each case....\u00a0...So, if the Fourier sine series of an odd function is just a special case of a Fourier series it makes some sense that the Fourier cosine series of an even function should also be a special case of a Fourier series.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do a quick example to verify this....\u00a0...Find   the Fourier series for ...\u00a0on .......Here are the integrals for the ...\u00a0and in this case because both the function   and cosine are even we\u2019ll be integrating an even function and so can   \u201csimplify\u201d the integral....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the previous example both of these integrals were   done in ... in the Fourier cosine series section and so we\u2019ll not bother redoing   them here.\u00a0 The coefficients are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next here is   the integral for the ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case   the function is even and sine is odd so the product is odd and we\u2019re   integrating over ...\u00a0and so the integral is zero....\u00a0...The Fourier   series is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...As suggested before we started this example the result here is identical to the result from ... in the Fourier cosine series section and so we can see that the Fourier cosine series of an even function is just a special case a Fourier series.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/FourierSeries.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Differential Equations - Fourier Series", "subject": "math"}},

by,...\u00a0...Finally, before we work an example, let\u2019s notice that because both ...\u00a0and the cosines are even the integrand in both of the integrals above is even and so we can write the formulas for the ...\u2019s as follows,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Find   the Fourier cosine series for ...\u00a0on .......We clearly have an even function here and so all we really   need to do is compute the coefficients and they are liable to be a little   messy because we\u2019ll need to do integration by parts twice.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave most of the actual integration   details to you to

we\u2019ve done here because   it will almost always be different from the other coefficients and it allows   us to actually plug the coefficients into the series....\u00a0...Now, just as we did in the previous section let\u2019s ask what we need to do in order to find the Fourier cosine series of a function that is not even.\u00a0 As with Fourier sine series when we make this change we\u2019ll need to move onto the interval ...\u00a0now instead of ...\u00a0and again we\u2019ll assume that the series will converge to ...\u00a0at this point and leave the discussion of the convergence of this

redo all the work above to get formulas for the coefficients let\u2019s instead go straight to the second method of finding the coefficients....\u00a0...In this case, before we actually proceed with this we\u2019ll need to define the even extension of a function, ...\u00a0on ....\u00a0 So, given a function ...\u00a0we\u2019ll define the even extension of the function as,...\u00a0...Showing that this is an even function is simple enough....and we can see that ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0and if ...\u00a0is already an even function we get ...\u00a0on .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some

function ...\u00a0on .......\u00a0...So, given a function ...\u00a0we\u2019ll let ...\u00a0be the even extension as defined above.\u00a0 Now, ...\u00a0is an even function on ...\u00a0and so we can write down its Fourier cosine series.\u00a0 This is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...and note that we\u2019ll use the second form of the integrals to compute the constants....\u00a0...Now, because we know that on

separately....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Putting these   together

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Before we start off this section we need to make it very clear that we are only going to scratch the surface of the topic of boundary value problems.\u00a0 There is enough material in the topic of boundary value problems that we could devote a whole class to it.\u00a0 The intent of this section is to give a brief (and we mean very brief) look at the idea of boundary value problems and to give enough information to allow us to do some basic partial differential equations in the next chapter....\u00a0...Now, with that out of the way, the first thing that we need to do is to define just what we mean by a boundary value problem (BVP for short).\u00a0 With initial value problems we had a differential equation and we specified the value of the solution and an appropriate number of derivatives at the same point (collectively called initial conditions).\u00a0 For instance for a second order differential equation the initial conditions are,...\u00a0...With boundary value problems we will have a differential equation and we will specify the function and/or derivatives at ... points, which we\u2019ll call boundary values.\u00a0 For second order differential equations, which will be looking at pretty much exclusively here, any of the following can, and will, be used for boundary conditions....\u00a0...\u00a0...As mentioned above we\u2019ll be looking pretty much exclusively at second order differential equations.\u00a0 We will also be restricting ourselves down to linear differential equations.\u00a0 So, for the purposes of our discussion here we\u2019ll be looking almost exclusively at differential equations in the form,...along with one of the sets of boundary conditions given in ... ...\u00a0....\u00a0 We will, on occasion, look at some different boundary conditions but the differential equation will always be on that can be written in this form....\u00a0...As we\u2019ll soon see much of what we know about initial value problems will not hold here.\u00a0 We can, of course, solve ... provided the coefficients are constant and for a few cases in which they aren\u2019t.\u00a0 None of that will change.\u00a0 The changes (and perhaps the problems) arise when we move from initial conditions to boundary conditions....\u00a0...One of the first changes is a definition that we saw all the time in the earlier chapters.\u00a0 In the earlier chapters we said that a differential equation was homogeneous if ...\u00a0for all ....\u00a0 Here we will say that a boundary value problem is ... if in addition to ...\u00a0we also have ...\u00a0and ...(regardless of the boundary conditions we use).\u00a0 If any of these are not zero we will call the BVP ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It is important to now remember that when we say homogeneous (or nonhomogeneous) we are saying something not only about the differential equation itself but also about the boundary conditions as well.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The biggest change that we\u2019re going to see here comes when we go to solve the boundary value problem.\u00a0 When solving linear initial value problems a unique solution will be guaranteed under very mild conditions.\u00a0 We only looked at this idea for first order IVP\u2019s but the idea does extend to higher order IVP\u2019s.\u00a0 In that ... we saw that all we needed to guarantee a unique solution was some basic continuity conditions.\u00a0 With boundary value problems we will often have no solution or infinitely many solutions even for very nice differential equations that would yield a unique solution if we had initial conditions instead of boundary conditions....\u00a0...Before we get into solving some of these let\u2019s next address the question of why we\u2019re even talking about these in the first place.\u00a0 As we\u2019ll see in the next chapter in the process of solving some partial differential equations we will run into boundary value problems that will need to be solved as well.\u00a0 In fact, a large part of the solution process there will be in dealing with the solution to the BVP.\u00a0 In these cases the boundary conditions will represent things like the temperature at either end of a bar, or the heat flow into/out of either end of a bar.\u00a0 Or maybe they will represent the location of ends of a vibrating string.\u00a0 So, the boundary conditions there will really be conditions on the boundary of some process....\u00a0...So, with some of basic stuff out of the way let\u2019s find some solutions to a few boundary value problems.\u00a0 Note as well that there really isn\u2019t anything new here yet.\u00a0 We ... how to solve the differential equation and we know how to find the constants by applying the conditions.\u00a0 The only difference is that here we\u2019ll be applying boundary conditions instead of initial conditions....\u00a0...Solve   the following BVP....Okay, this is a simple differential equation so solve and   so we\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that the general solution to this is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now all that we   need to do is apply the boundary conditions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

...\u00a0...We mentioned above that some boundary value problems can have no solutions or infinite solutions we had better do a couple of examples of those as well here.\u00a0 This next set of examples will also show just how small of a change to the BVP it takes to move into these other possibilities....\u00a0...Solve   the following BVP....We\u2019re working with the same differential equation as the   first example so we still have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Upon applying   the boundary conditions we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So in this   case, unlike previous example, both boundary conditions tell us that we have   to have ...\u00a0and neither one of them tell us anything   about ....\u00a0 Remember however that all we\u2019re asking for   is a solution to the differential equation that satisfies the two given   boundary conditions and the following function will do that,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In other words,   regardless of the value of ...\u00a0we get a solution and so, in this case we   get infinitely many solutions to the boundary value problem....\u00a0...Solve   the following BVP....Again, we have the following general solution,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This time the   boundary conditions give us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case we   have a set of boundary conditions each of which requires a different value of   ...\u00a0in order to be satisfied.\u00a0 This, however, is not possible and so in   this case have .......\u00a0...So, with Examples 2 and 3 we can see that only a small change to the boundary conditions, in relation to each other and to Example 1, can completely change the nature of the solution.\u00a0 All three of these examples used the same differential equation and yet a different set of initial conditions yielded, no solutions, one solution, or infinitely many solutions....\u00a0...Note that this kind of behavior is not always unpredictable however.\u00a0 If we use the conditions ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0the only way we\u2019ll ever get a solution to the boundary value problem is if we have,...for any value of ....\u00a0 Also, note that if we do have these boundary conditions we\u2019ll in fact get infinitely many solutions....\u00a0...All the examples we\u2019ve worked to this point involved the same differential equation and the same type of boundary conditions so let\u2019s work a couple more just to make sure that we\u2019ve got some more examples here.\u00a0 Also, note that with each of these we could tweak the boundary conditions a little to get any of the possible solution behaviors to show up (... zero, one or infinitely many solutions)....\u00a0...Solve   the following BVP....The general solution for this differential equation

we generally prefer solutions to be non-trivial.\u00a0 This will be a major idea in the next section. ...\u00a0...Before we leave this section an important point needs to be made.\u00a0 In each of the examples, with one exception, the differential equation that we solved was in the form,...\u00a0...The one exception to this still solved this differential equation except it was not a homogeneous differential equation and so we were still solving this basic differential equation in some manner....\u00a0...So, there are probably several natural questions that can arise at this point.\u00a0 Do all BVP\u2019s involve this differential equation and if not why did we spend so much time solving this one to the exclusion of all the other possible differential equations?...\u00a0...The answers to these questions are fairly simple.\u00a0 First, this differential equation is most definitely not the only one used in boundary value problems.\u00a0 It does however exhibit all of the behavior that we wanted to talk about here and has the added bonus of being very easy to solve.\u00a0 So, by using this differential equation almost exclusively we can see and discuss the important behavior that we need to discuss and frees us up from lots of potentially messy solution details and or messy solutions.\u00a0 We will, on occasion, look at other differential equations in the rest of this chapter, but we will still be working almost exclusively with this one....\u00a0...There is another important reason for looking at this differential equation.\u00a0 When we get to the next chapter and take a brief look at solving partial differential equations we will see that almost every one of the examples that we\u2019ll work there come down to exactly this differential equation.\u00a0 Also, in those problems we will be working some \u201creal\u201d problems that are actually solved in places and so are not just \u201cmade up\u201d problems for the purposes of examples.\u00a0 Admittedly they will have some simplifications in them, but they do come close to realistic problem in some cases.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/BoundaryValueProblem.aspx", "media": "text", "title":

will alternate in   sign.\u00a0 Next notice that we can turn the   denominator into a factorial, ...\u00a0to be exact, if we multiply top and bottom   by the numbers that are already in the numerator and so this will turn these   numbers into squares.\u00a0 Next notice that   the product in the top will start at 1 and increase by 4 until we reach ....\u00a0 So, taking all of this into account we

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to start taking a look at Fourier series.\u00a0 We should point out that this is a subject that can span a whole class and what we\u2019ll be doing in this section (as well as the next couple of sections) is intended to be nothing more than a very brief look at the subject.\u00a0 The point here is to do just enough to allow us to do some basic solutions to partial differential equations in the next chapter.\u00a0 There are many topics in the study of Fourier series that we\u2019ll not even touch upon here....\u00a0...So, with that out of the way let\u2019s get started, although we\u2019re not going to start off with Fourier series.\u00a0 Let\u2019s instead think back to our Calculus class where we looked at .... \u00a0With Taylor Series we wrote a series representation of a function, ..., as a series whose terms were powers of ...\u00a0for some ....\u00a0 With some conditions we were able to

that derivatives of all orders exist at ....\u00a0 Or in other words ...\u00a0exists for ...\u00a0\u00a0Also for some functions the value of ... may end up being quite small....\u00a0...These two issues (along with a couple of others) mean that this is not always the best way of writing a series representation for a function.\u00a0 In many cases it works fine and there will be no reason to need a different kind of series. \u00a0There are times however where another type of series is either preferable or required....\u00a0...We\u2019re going to build up an alternative series representation for a function over the course of the next couple of sections.\u00a0 The ultimate goal for the rest of this chapter will be to write down a series representation for a function in terms of sines and cosines....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start things off by assuming that the function, ..., we want to write a series representation for is an odd function (... ...).\u00a0 Because ...\u00a0is odd it makes some sense that should be able to write a series representation for this in terms of sines only (since they are also odd functions)....\u00a0...What we\u2019ll try to do here is write ...\u00a0as the following series representation, called a ..., on .......There are a couple of issues to note here.\u00a0 First, at this point, we are going to assume that the series representation will converge to ...\u00a0on ....\u00a0 We will be looking into whether or not it will actually converge in a later ....\u00a0 However, assuming that the series does converge to ...\u00a0it is interesting to note that, unlike Taylor Series, this representation will always converge on the same interval and that the interval does not depend upon the function....\u00a0...Second, the series representation will not involve powers of sine (again contrasting this with Taylor Series) but instead will involve sines with different arguments....\u00a0...Finally, the argument of the sines, ..., may seem like an odd choice that was arbitrarily chosen and in some ways it was.\u00a0 For Fourier sine series the argument doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be this but there are several reasons for the choice here.\u00a0 First, this is the argument that will naturally arise in the next chapter when we use Fourier series (in general and not necessarily Fourier sine series) to help us solve some basic partial differential equations.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The next reason for using this argument is that fact that the set of functions that we chose to work with, ...in this case, need to be ... on the given interval, ...\u00a0in this case, and note that in the last section we ... that in fact they are.\u00a0 In other words, the choice of functions we\u2019re going to be working with and the interval we\u2019re working on will be tied together in some way.\u00a0 We can use a different argument, but will need to also choose an interval on which we can prove that the sines (with the different argument) are orthogonal....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start off by assuming that given an odd function, ..., we can in fact find a Fourier sine series, of the form given above, to represent the function on ....\u00a0 This means we will have,...\u00a0...As noted above we\u2019ll discuss whether or not this even can be done and if the series representation does in fact converge to the function in later section.\u00a0 At this point we\u2019re simply going to assume that it can be done.\u00a0 The question now is how to determine the coefficients, ..., in the series....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the series above and multiply both sides by ...\u00a0\u00a0where ... is a fixed integer in the range ....\u00a0 In other words we multiply both sides by any of the sines in the set of sines that we\u2019re working with here.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s integrate both sides of this from ...\u00a0to .......\u00a0...At this point we\u2019ve got a small issue to deal with.\u00a0 We know from Calculus that an integral of a finite series (more commonly called a finite sum\u2026.) is nothing more than the (finite) sum of the integrals of the pieces.\u00a0 In other words for finite series we can interchange an integral and a series.\u00a0 For infinite series however, we cannot always do this.\u00a0 For some integrals of infinite series we cannot interchange an integral and a series.\u00a0 Luckily enough for us we actually can interchange the integral and the series in this case.\u00a0 Doing this and factoring the constant, ..., out of the integral gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, recall from the last section we ... that ...\u00a0is orthogonal on ...and that,...\u00a0...So, what does this mean for us.\u00a0 As we work through the various values of ... in the series and compute the value of the integrals all but one of the integrals will be zero.\u00a0 The only non-zero integral will come when we have ..., in which case the integral has the value of ....\u00a0 Therefore, the only non-zero term in the series will come when we have ...\u00a0and our equation becomes,...\u00a0...Finally all we need to do is divide by ... and we now have an equation for each of the coefficients....\u00a0...Next, note that because we\u2019re integrating two odd functions the integrand of this integral is even and so we also know that,...\u00a0...Summarizing all this work up the Fourier sine series of an odd function ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0is given by,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example....\u00a0...Find   the Fourier sine series for ...\u00a0on .......First note that the function we\u2019re working with is in fact   an odd function and so this is something we can do.\u00a0 There really isn\u2019t much to do here other   than to compute the coefficients for .......\u00a0...Here is that work and note that we\u2019re going to leave the   integration by parts details to you to verify.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget that ..., ..., and ...\u00a0are constants!...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...These integrals   can, on occasion, be somewhat messy especially when we use a general ... for the endpoints of the interval   instead of a specific number....\u00a0...Now, taking   advantage of the fact that ... is an   integer we know that ...\u00a0and that ....\u00a0\u00a0 We therefore have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The Fourier   sine

...\u00a0...\u00a0...At this point we should probably point out that we\u2019ll be doing most, if not all, of our work here on a general interval (... or ...) instead of intervals with specific numbers for the endpoints.\u00a0 There are a couple of reasons for this.\u00a0 First, it gives a much more general formula that will work for any interval of that form which is always nice.\u00a0 Secondly, when we run into this kind of work in the next chapter it will also be on general intervals so we may as well get used to them now....\u00a0...Now, finding the Fourier sine series of an odd function is fine and good but what if, for some reason, we wanted to find the Fourier sine series for a function that is not odd?\u00a0 To see how to do this we\u2019re going to have to make a change.\u00a0 The above work was done on the interval ....\u00a0 In the case of a function that is not odd we\u2019ll be working on the interval ....\u00a0 The reason for this will be made apparent in a bit....\u00a0...So, we are now going to do is to try to find a series representation for ...\u00a0on the interval ...\u00a0that is in the form,...or in other words,...\u00a0...As we did with the Fourier sine series on ...\u00a0we are going to assume that the series will in fact converge to ...\u00a0and we\u2019ll hold off discussing the convergence of the series for a later ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are two methods of generating formulas for the coefficients, ..., although we\u2019ll see in a bit that they really the same way, just looked at from different perspectives....\u00a0...The first method is to just ignore the fact that ...\u00a0is not odd and proceed in the same manner that we did above only this time we\u2019ll take advantage of the fact that we ... in the previous section that ...\u00a0also forms an orthogonal set on ...\u00a0and that,...\u00a0...So, if we do this then all we need to do is multiply both sides of our series by ..., integrate from 0 to ... and interchange the integral and series to get,...\u00a0...Now, plugging in for the integral we arrive at,...\u00a0...Upon solving for the coefficient we arrive at,...\u00a0...Note that this is identical to the second form of the coefficients that we arrived at above by assuming ...\u00a0was odd and working on the interval ....\u00a0 The fact that we arrived at essentially the same coefficients is not actually all the surprising as we\u2019ll see once we\u2019ve looked the second method of generating the coefficients....\u00a0...Before we look at the second method of generating the coefficients we need to take a brief look at another concept.\u00a0 Given a function, ..., we define the ... of ...\u00a0to be the new function,...\u00a0...It\u2019s pretty easy to see that this is an odd function....and we can also know that on ...\u00a0we have that ....\u00a0 Also note that if ...\u00a0is already an odd function then we in fact get ...\u00a0on .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at a couple of odd extensions before we proceed any further....\u00a0...Sketch   the odd extension of each of the given functions....\u00a0on ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0on ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Not much to do with these other than to define the odd   extension and then sketch it....\u00a0... ...\u00a0on ...Here is the odd extension of this function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Below is the graph of both the function and its odd   extension.\u00a0 Note that we\u2019ve put the   \u201cextension\u201d in with a dashed line to make it clear the portion of the   function that is being added to allow us to get the odd extension....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0on ...First note that this is clearly an even function.\u00a0 That does not however mean that we can\u2019t   define the odd extension for it.\u00a0 The   odd extension for this function is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The sketch of the original function and its odd extension   are ,...\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s first write down the odd extension for this   function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The sketch of   the original function and its odd extension are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...With the definition of the odd extension (and a couple of examples) out of the way we can now take a look at the second method for getting formulas for the coefficients of the Fourier sine series for a function ...\u00a0on .... First, given such a function define its odd extension as above. At this point, because ...\u00a0is an odd function, we know that on ...\u00a0the Fourier sine series for ...\u00a0(and NOT ...\u00a0yet)\u00a0 is,...\u00a0...However, because we know that ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0we can also see that as long as we are on ...\u00a0we have,...\u00a0...So, exactly the same formula for the coefficients regardless of how we arrived at the formula and the second method justifies why they are the same here as they were when we derived them for the Fourier sine series for an odd function....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s find the Fourier sine series for each of the functions that we looked at in Example 2.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that again we are working on general intervals here instead of specific numbers for the right endpoint to get a more general formula for any interval of this form and because again this is the kind of work we\u2019ll be doing in the next chapter....\u00a0...Also, we\u2019ll again be leaving the actually integration details up to you to verify.\u00a0 In most cases it will involve some fairly simple integration by parts complicated by all the constants (..., ..., ..., etc.) that show up in the integral....\u00a0...Find   the Fourier sine series for ...\u00a0on .......There really isn\u2019t much to do here other than computing   the coefficients so here they are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the   simplification process don\u2019t forget that ...   is an integer....\u00a0...So, with the   coefficients we get the following Fourier sine series for this function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...In the next example it is interesting to note that while we started out this section looking only at odd functions we\u2019re now going to be finding the Fourier sine series of an even function on ....\u00a0 Recall however that we\u2019re really finding the Fourier sine series of the odd extension of this function and so we\u2019re okay.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Find   the Fourier sine series for ...\u00a0on .......In this case the coefficients are liable to be somewhat messy   given the fact that the integrals will involve integration by parts   twice.\u00a0 Here is the work for the   coefficients....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As noted above   the coefficients are not the most pleasant ones, but there they are.\u00a0 The Fourier sine series for this function   is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...In the last example of this section we\u2019ll be finding the Fourier sine series of a piecewise function and can definitely complicate the integrals a little but they do show up on occasion and so we need to be able to deal with them....\u00a0...Find   the Fourier sine series for ...\u00a0on .......Here is the integral for the coefficients....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we   need to split the integral up because of the piecewise nature of the original   function.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do the two integrals   separately ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Putting all of   this together gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...   ...\u00a0...So, the Fourier   sine series for this function is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...   ...\u00a0...\u00a0...As the previous two examples has shown the coefficients for these can be quite messy but that will often be the case and so we shouldn\u2019t let that get us too excited.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/FourierSineSeries.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Differential Equations - Fourier Sine Series", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "This is going to be a short section.\u00a0 We just need to have a brief discussion about a couple of ideas that we\u2019ll be dealing with on occasion as we move into the next topic of this chapter....\u00a0...The first topic we need to discuss is that of a periodic function.\u00a0 A function is said to be ... with ... if the following is true,...\u00a0...The following is a nice little fact about periodic functions....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0 and ...   are both periodic functions with period ...   then so is ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...This is easy enough to prove so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...The two periodic functions that most of us are familiar are sine and cosine and in fact we\u2019ll be using these two functions regularly in the remaining sections of this chapter.\u00a0 So, having said that let\u2019s close off this discussion of periodic functions with the following fact,...\u00a0...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are periodic functions with period .......\u00a0...The next quick idea that we need to discuss is that of even and odd functions....\u00a0...Recall that a function is said to be ... if,...and a function is said to be ... if,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The standard examples of even functions are ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0while the standard examples of odd functions are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The following fact about certain integrals of even/odd functions will be useful in some of our work....\u00a0...If   ...\u00a0is an even function then,...   ...   ...If\u00a0 ...\u00a0is an odd function then,...\u00a0...Note that this fact is only valid on a \u201csymmetric\u201d interval, ... an interval in the form ....\u00a0 If we aren\u2019t integrating on a \u201csymmetric\u201d interval then the fact may or may not be true....\u00a0...The final topic that we need to discuss here is that of orthogonal functions.\u00a0 This idea will be integral to what we\u2019ll be doing in the remainder of this chapter and in the next chapter as we discuss one of the basic solution methods for partial differential equations....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first get the definition of orthogonal functions out of the way....\u00a0...Two   non-zero functions, ...\u00a0and ...,   are said to be ... on ...\u00a0if,...   ...   ...A   set of non-zero functions, ...,   is said to be ...   on ...\u00a0(or just an ... if we\u2019re being lazy) if ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are orthogonal for every ....\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...Note that in the case of ...\u00a0for the second definition we know that we\u2019ll get a positive value from the integral because,...\u00a0...Recall that when we integrate a positive function we know the result will be positive as well....\u00a0...Also note that the non-zero requirement is important because otherwise the integral would be trivially zero regardless of the other function we were using....\u00a0...Before we work some examples there are a nice set of trig formulas that we\u2019ll need to help us with some of the integrals....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s work some examples that we\u2019ll need over the course of the next couple of sections....\u00a0...Show   that ...\u00a0is mutually orthogonal on .......This is not too difficult to do.\u00a0 All we really need to do is evaluate the   following integral....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before we start evaluating this integral let\u2019s notice that   the integrand is the product of two even functions and so must also be   even.\u00a0 This means that we can use Fact   3 above to write the integral as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are two   reasons for doing this.\u00a0 First having a   limit of zero will often make the evaluation step a little easier and that   will be the case here.\u00a0 We\u2019ll discuss   the second reason after we\u2019re done with the example....\u00a0...Now, in order to do this integral we\u2019ll actually need to   consider three cases....\u00a0...In this case the integral is very easy and is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This integral   is a little harder than the first case, but not by much (provided we recall a   simple trig formula).\u00a0 The integral for   this case is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, at the point we need to recall that ... is an integer and so ...\u00a0and our final value for the is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first two   cases are really just showing that if ...\u00a0the integral is not zero (as it shouldn\u2019t   be) and depending upon the value of ...   (and hence ...) we get different values   of the integral.\u00a0 Now we need to do the   third case and this, in some ways, is the important case since we must get   zero out of this integral in order to know that the set is an orthogonal set.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take care of the final case....\u00a0...This integral is the \u201cmessiest\u201d of the three that we\u2019ve   had to do here.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just start off   by writing the integral down....\u00a0...In this case we   can\u2019t combine/simplify as we did in the previous two cases.\u00a0 We can however, acknowledge that we\u2019ve got   a product of two cosines with different arguments and so we can use one of   the trig formulas above to break up the product as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we know   that ... and ... are both integers and so ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are also integers and so both of the sines   above must be zero and all together we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve shown   that if ...\u00a0the integral is zero and if ...\u00a0the value of the integral is a positive   constant and so the set is mutually orthogonal....\u00a0...In all of the work above we kept both forms of the integral at every step.\u00a0 Let\u2019s discuss why we did this a little bit.\u00a0 By keeping both forms of the integral around we were able to show that not only is ...\u00a0mutually orthogonal on ...\u00a0but it is also mutually orthogonal on ....\u00a0 The only difference is the value of the integral when ...and we can get those values from the work above....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example....\u00a0...Show   that ...\u00a0is mutually orthogonal on ...\u00a0and on .......First we\u2019ll acknowledge from the start this time that   we\u2019ll be showing orthogonality on both of the intervals.\u00a0 Second, we need to start this set at ...\u00a0because if we used ...\u00a0the first function would be zero and we   don\u2019t want the zero function to show up on our list....\u00a0...As with the first example all we really need to do is   evaluate the following integral....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case integrand is the product of two odd functions   and so must be even.\u00a0 This means that   we can again use Fact 3 above to write the integral as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We only have   two cases to do for the integral here....\u00a0...Not much to   this integral.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty similar to   the previous examples second case....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Summarizing up we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the previous example this can be a little messier   but it is also nearly identical to the third case from the previous example   so we\u2019ll not show a lot of the

integral is zero and if ...\u00a0the value of the integral is a positive   constant and so the set is mutually orthogonal....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now shown that ...\u00a0mutually orthogonal on ...\u00a0and on .......\u00a0...We need to work one more example in this section....\u00a0...Show   that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are mutually orthogonal on .......This example is a little different from the previous two   examples.\u00a0 Here we want to show that   together both sets are mutually orthogonal on ....\u00a0 To show this we need to show three   things.\u00a0 First (and second actually) we   need to show that individually each set is mutually orthogonal and we\u2019ve   already done that in the previous two examples.\u00a0 The third (and only) thing we need to show   here is that if we take one function from one set and another function from   the other set and we integrate them we\u2019ll get zero....\u00a0...Also, note that this time we really do only want to do the   one interval as the two sets, taken together, are not mutually orthogonal on ....\u00a0 You might want to do the integral on this   interval to verify that it won\u2019t always be zero....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s take care of the one integral that we need to do   here and there isn\u2019t a lot to do.\u00a0 Here   is the integral....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The integrand in this case is the product of an odd   function (the sine) and an even function (the cosine) and so the integrand is   an odd function.\u00a0 Therefore, since the   integral is on a symmetric interval, ...   ...,   and so by Fact 3 above we know the integral must be zero or,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in previous   examples we\u2019ve shown that on the interval ...\u00a0the two sets are mutually orthogonal   individually and here we\u2019ve shown that integrating a product of a sine and a   cosine gives zero.\u00a0 Therefore, as a   combined set they are also mutually orthogonal....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now worked three examples here dealing with orthogonality and we should note that these were not just pulled out of the air as random examples to work.\u00a0 In the following sections (and following chapter) we\u2019ll need the results from these examples.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s summarize those results up here....\u00a0...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are mutually orthogonal on ...\u00a0as individual sets and as a combined set....   ...   ...   ...\u00a0is mutually orthogonal on .......   ...   ...   ...\u00a0\u00a0is   mutually orthogonal on .......\u00a0...We will also be needing the results of the integrals themselves, both on ...\u00a0and on ...\u00a0so let\u2019s also summarize those up here as well so we can refer to them when we need to....\u00a0...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...\u00a0...With this summary we\u2019ll leave this

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we want to take a brief look at systems of differential equations that are larger than 2 x 2.\u00a0 The problem here is that unlike the first few sections where we looked at ... order differential equations we can\u2019t really come up with a set of formulas that will always work for every system.\u00a0 So, with that in mind we\u2019re going to look at all possible cases for a 3 x 3 system (leaving some details for you to verify at times) and then a couple of quick comments about 4 x 4 systems to illustrate how to extend things out to even larger systems and then we\u2019ll leave it to you to actually extend things out if you\u2019d like to....\u00a0...We will also not be doing any actual examples in this section.\u00a0 The point of this section is just to show how to extend out what we know about 2 x 2 systems to larger systems....\u00a0...Initially the process is identical regardless of the size of the system.\u00a0 So, for a system of 3 differential equations with 3 unknown functions we first put the system into matrix form,...where the coefficient matrix, ..., is a 3 x 3 matrix.\u00a0 We next need to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for ... and because ... is a 3 x 3 matrix we know that there will be 3 eigenvalues (including repeated eigenvalues if there are any).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is where the process from the 2 x 2 systems starts to vary.\u00a0 We will need a total of 3 linearly independent solutions to form the general solution.\u00a0 Some of what we know from the 2 x 2 systems can be brought forward to this point.\u00a0 For instance, we know that solutions corresponding to simple eigenvalues (... they only occur once in the list of eigenvalues) will be linearly independent.\u00a0 We know that solutions from a set of complex conjugate eigenvalues will be linearly independent.\u00a0 We also know how to get a set of linearly independent solutions from a double eigenvalue with a single eigenvector....\u00a0...There are also a couple of facts about eigenvalues/eigenvectors that we need to review here as well.\u00a0 First, provided ... has only real entries (which it always will here) all complex eigenvalues will occur in conjugate pairs (...) and their associated eigenvectors will also be complex conjugates of each other.\u00a0 Next, if an eigenvalue has multiplicity ...\u00a0(... occurs at least twice in the list of eigenvalues) then there will be anywhere from 1 to ... linearly independent eigenvectors for the eigenvalue....\u00a0...With all these ideas in mind let\u2019s start going through all the possible combinations of eigenvalues that we can possibly have for a 3 x 3 case.\u00a0 Let\u2019s also note that for a 3 x 3 system it is impossible to have only 2 real distinct eigenvalues.\u00a0 The only possibilities are to have 1 or 3 real distinct eigenvalues....\u00a0...Here are all the possible cases....\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ll have the real, distinct eigenvalues ...\u00a0and their associated eigenvectors, ..., ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are guaranteed to be linearly independent and so the three linearly independent solutions we get from this case are,...\u00a0...From the real eigenvalue/eigenvector pair, ...\u00a0and ..., we get one solution,...\u00a0...We get the other two solutions in the same manner that we did with the ....\u00a0 If the eigenvalues are ...\u00a0with eigenvectors ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we can get two real-valued solution by using ... to expand,...into its real and imaginary parts, ....\u00a0 The final two real valued solutions we need are then,...\u00a0...From the real eigenvalue/eigenvector pair, ...\u00a0and ..., we get one solution,...\u00a0...From our work in the 2 x 2 systems we ... that from the double eigenvalue ...\u00a0with single eigenvector, ..., we get the following two solutions,...where ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0must satisfy the following equations,...\u00a0...Note that the first equation simply tells us that ...\u00a0must be the single eigenvector for this eigenvalue, ..., and we usually just say that the second solution we get from the double root case is,...\u00a0...We didn\u2019t look at this case back when we were examining the 2 x 2 systems but it is easy enough to deal with.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll have a single real distinct eigenvalue/eigenvector pair, ...\u00a0and ..., as well as a double eigenvalue ...\u00a0and the double eigenvalue has two linearly independent eigenvectors, ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...In this case all three eigenvectors are linearly independent and so we get the following three linearly independent solutions,...\u00a0...We are now out of the cases that compare to those that we did with 2 x 2 systems and we now need to move into the brand new case that we pick up for 3 x 3 systems.\u00a0 This new case involves eigenvalues with multiplicity of 3.\u00a0 As we noted above we can have 1, 2, or 3 linearly independent eigenvectors and so we actually have 3 sub cases to deal with here.\u00a0 So let\u2019s go through these final 3 cases for a 3 x 3 system....\u00a0...The eigenvalue/eigenvector pair in this case are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Because the eigenvalue is real we know that the first solution we need is,...\u00a0...We can use the work from the double eigenvalue with one eigenvector to get that a second solution is,...\u00a0...For a third solution we can take a clue from how we dealt with ... order differential equations with roots multiplicity 3.\u00a0 In those cases we multiplied the original solution by a ....\u00a0 However, just as with the double eigenvalue case that won\u2019t be enough to get us a solution.\u00a0 In this case the third solution will be,...where ..., ..., and ...\u00a0must satisfy,...\u00a0...You can verify that this is a solution and the conditions by taking a derivative and plugging into the system....\u00a0...Now, the first condition simply tells us that ...\u00a0because we only have a single eigenvector here and so we can reduce this third solution to,...where ..., and ...\u00a0must satisfy,...and finally notice that we would have solved the new first condition in determining the second solution above and so all we really need to do here is solve the final condition....\u00a0...As a final note in this case, the ...\u00a0is in the solution solely to keep any extra constants from appearing in the conditions which in turn allows us to reuse previous results. ...\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ll have the eigenvalue ...\u00a0with the two linearly independent eigenvectors ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0so we get the following two linearly independent solutions,...\u00a0...We now need a third solution.\u00a0 The third solution will be in the form,...where ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0must satisfy the following equations,...We\u2019ve already verified that this will be a solution with these conditions in the double eigenvalue case (that work only required a repeated eigenvalue, not necessarily a double one).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...However, unlike the previous times we\u2019ve seen this we can\u2019t just say that ...\u00a0is an eigenvalue.\u00a0 In all the previous cases in which we\u2019ve seen this condition we had a single eigenvalue and this time we have two linearly independent eigenvalues.\u00a0 This means that the most general possible solution to the first condition is,...\u00a0...This creates problems in solving the second condition.\u00a0 The second condition will not have solutions for every choice of ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and the choice that we use will be dependent upon the eigenvectors.\u00a0 So upon solving the first condition we would need to plug the general solution into the second condition and then proceed to determine conditions on ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0that would allow us to solve the second condition. ...\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ll have the eigenvalue ...\u00a0with the three linearly independent eigenvectors ..., ..., and ...\u00a0so we get the following three linearly independent solutions,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ll close this section out with a couple of comments about 4 x 4 systems.\u00a0 In these cases we will have 4 eigenvalues and will need 4 linearly independent solutions in order to get a general solution.\u00a0 The vast majority of the cases here are natural extensions of what 3 x 3 systems cases and in fact will use a vast majority of that work.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here are a couple of new cases that we should comment briefly on however.\u00a0 With 4 x 4 systems it will now be possible to have two different sets of double eigenvalues and two different sets of complex conjugate eigenvalues.\u00a0 In either of these cases we can treat each one as a separate case and use our previous knowledge about double eigenvalues and complex eigenvalues to get the solutions we need....\u00a0...It is also now possible to have a \u201cdouble\u201d complex eigenvalue.\u00a0 In other words we can have ...\u00a0each occur twice in the list of eigenvalues.\u00a0 The solutions for this case aren\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 We get two solutions in the normal way of dealing with complex eigenvalues.\u00a0 The remaining two solutions will come from the work we did for a double eigenvalue.\u00a0 The work we did in that case did not require that the eigenvalue/eigenvector pair to be real.\u00a0 Therefore if the eigenvector associated with ...\u00a0is ...\u00a0then the second solution will be,...and once we\u2019ve determined ...\u00a0we can again split this up into its real and imaginary parts using Euler\u2019s formula to get two new real valued solutions....\u00a0...Finally with 4 x 4 systems we can now have eigenvalues with multiplicity of 4.\u00a0 In these cases we can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 linearly independent eigenvectors and we can use our work with 3 x 3 systems to see how to generate solutions for these cases.\u00a0 The one issue that you\u2019ll need to pay attention to is the conditions for the 2 and 3 eigenvector cases will have the same complications that the 2 eigenvector case has in the 3 x 3 systems....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve discussed some of the issues involved in systems larger than 2 x 2 and it is hopefully clear that when we move into larger systems the work can be become vastly more complicated.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/HOSystems.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online

...\u00a0...As with the   previous example we again know that ...\u00a0and so ....\u00a0 Therefore we must have .......\u00a0...So, for this   BVP we again have no negative eigenvalues....\u00a0...In summary then we will have the following   eigenvalues/eigenfunctions for this BVP....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice as well   that we can actually combine these if we allow the list of ...\u2019s for the first one to start at zero   instead of one.\u00a0 This will often not   happen, but when it does we\u2019ll take advantage of it.\u00a0 So the \u201cofficial\u201d list of   eigenvalues/eigenfunctions for this BVP is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in the previous two examples we saw that we generally need to consider different cases for ...\u00a0as different values will often lead to different general solutions.\u00a0 Do not get too locked into the cases we did here.\u00a0 We will mostly be solving this particular differential equation and so it will be tempting to assume that these are always the cases that we\u2019ll be looking at, but there are BVP\u2019s that will require other/different cases....\u00a0...Also, as we saw in the two examples sometimes one or more of the cases will not yield any eigenvalues.\u00a0 This will often happen, but again we shouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that we didn\u2019t have negative eigenvalues for either of these two BVP\u2019s.\u00a0 There are BVP\u2019s that will have negative eigenvalues....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example with a very different set of boundary conditions.\u00a0 These are not the traditional boundary conditions that we\u2019ve been looking at to this point, but we\u2019ll see in the next chapter how these can arise from certain physical problems....\u00a0...Find   all the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the following BVP....So, in this example we aren\u2019t actually going to specify   the solution or its derivative at the boundaries.\u00a0 Instead we\u2019ll simply specify that the   solution must be the same at the two boundaries and the derivative of the solution   must also be the same at the two boundaries.\u00a0   Also, this type of boundary condition will typically be on an interval   of the form [-L,L] instead of [0,L] as we\u2019ve been working on to this point....\u00a0...As mentioned above these kind of boundary conditions arise   very naturally in certain physical problems and we\u2019ll see that in the next   chapter....\u00a0...As with the previous two examples we still have the   standard three cases to look at....\u00a0...The general   solution for this case is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying the   first boundary condition and using the fact that cosine is an even function (...) and that sine is an odd function (... ...).\u00a0\u00a0   gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This time,   unlike the previous two examples this doesn\u2019t really tell us anything.\u00a0 We could have ...\u00a0but it is also completely possible, at this   point in the problem anyway, for us to have ...\u00a0as well....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s go   ahead and apply the second boundary condition and see if we get anything out   of that....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we get   something very similar to what we got after applying the first boundary   condition.\u00a0 Since we are assuming that ...\u00a0this tells us that either ...\u00a0or .......\u00a0...Note however   that if ...\u00a0then we will have to have ...\u00a0and we\u2019ll get the trivial solution.\u00a0 We therefore need to require that ...\u00a0and so just as we\u2019ve done for the previous   two examples we can now get the eigenvalues,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Recalling that ...\u00a0and we can see that we do need to start the   list of possible ...\u2019s at one instead   of zero....\u00a0...So, we now know   the eigenvalues for this case, but what about the eigenfunctions.\u00a0 The solution for a given eigenvalue is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and we\u2019ve got   no reason to believe that either of the two constants are zero or non-zero   for that matter.\u00a0 In cases like these   we get two sets of eigenfunctions, one corresponding to each constant.\u00a0 The two sets of eigenfunctions for this   case are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now the second   case. ...\u00a0...The general   solution is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying the   first boundary condition gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Using this the   general solution is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and note that   this will trivially satisfy the second boundary condition just as we saw in   the second example above.\u00a0 Therefore we   again have ...\u00a0as an eigenvalue for this BVP and the   eigenfunctions corresponding to this eigenvalue is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally let\u2019s   take care of the third case....\u00a0...The general   solution here is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying the   first boundary condition and using the fact that hyperbolic cosine is even   and hyperbolic sine is odd gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, in this   case we are assuming that ...\u00a0and so we know that ...\u00a0which in turn tells us that ....\u00a0 We therefore must have .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s now apply   the second boundary condition to get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...By our   assumption on ...\u00a0we again have no choice here but to have .......\u00a0...Therefore, in   this case the only solution is the trivial solution and so, for this BVP we   again have no negative eigenvalues....\u00a0...In summary then we will have the following   eigenvalues/eigenfunctions for this BVP....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we\u2019ve   acknowledged that for ...\u00a0we had two sets of eigenfunctions by listing   them each separately.\u00a0 Also, we can   again combine the last two into one set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\u00a0 Doing so gives the following set of   eigenvalues and eigenfunctions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Once again we\u2019ve got an example with no negative eigenvalues.\u00a0 We can\u2019t stress enough that this is more a function of the differential equation we\u2019re working with than anything and there will be examples in which we may get negative eigenvalues....\u00a0...Now, to this point we\u2019ve only worked with one differential equation so let\u2019s work an example with a different differential equation just to make sure that we don\u2019t get too locked into this one differential equation.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before working this example let\u2019s note that we will still be working the vast majority of our examples with the one differential equation we\u2019ve been using to this point.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with this other differential equation just to make sure that we don\u2019t get too locked into using one single differential equation....\u00a0...Find   all the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the following BVP....This is an ...\u00a0 and so we know that we\u2019ll   need to find the roots of the following quadratic....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The roots to   this quadratic are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we are going to again have some cases to work with   here, however they won\u2019t be the same as the previous examples.\u00a0 The solution will depend on whether or not   the roots are real distinct, double or complex and these cases will depend   upon the sign/value of ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s go through the cases....\u00a0...In this case   the roots will be complex and we\u2019ll need to write them as follows in order to   write down the solution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...By writing the   roots in this fashion we know that ...\u00a0and so ...\u00a0is now a real number, which we need in order   to write the following solution,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying the   first boundary condition gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The second   boundary condition gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In order to   avoid the trivial solution for this case we\u2019ll require,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is much   more complicated of a condition than we\u2019ve seen to this point, but other than   that we do the same thing.\u00a0 So, solving   for ...\u00a0gives us the following set of eigenvalues   for this case....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we   need to start the list of ...\u2019s off   at one and not zero to make sure that we have ...\u00a0as we\u2019re assuming for this case....\u00a0...The   eigenfunctions that correspond to these eigenvalues are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now the second   case. ...\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case we   get a double root of ...\u00a0and so the solution is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying the   first boundary condition

we\u2019ve now worked an example using a differential equation other than the \u201cstandard\u201d one we\u2019ve been using to this point.\u00a0 As we saw in the work however, the basic process was pretty much the same.\u00a0 We determined that there were a number of cases (three here, but it won\u2019t always be three) that gave different solutions.\u00a0 We examined each case to determine if non-trivial solutions were possible and if so found the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to that case....\u00a0...We need to work one last example in this section before we leave this section for some new topics.\u00a0 The four examples that we\u2019ve worked to this point were all fairly simple (with simple being relative of course\u2026), however we don\u2019t want to leave without acknowledging that many eigenvalue/eigenfunctions problems are so easy....\u00a0...In many examples it is not even possible to get a complete list of all possible eigenvalues for a BVP.\u00a0 Often the equations that we need to solve to get the eigenvalues are difficult if not impossible to solve exactly.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at one example like this to see what kinds of things can be done to at least get an idea of what the eigenvalues look like in these kinds of cases....\u00a0...Find   all the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the following BVP....The boundary conditions for this BVP are fairly different   from those that we\u2019ve worked with to this point.\u00a0 However, the basic process is the   same.\u00a0 So let\u2019s start off with the   first case....\u00a0...The general   solution to the differential equation is identical to the first few examples   and so we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Applying the   first boundary condition gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

...\u00a0...So, if we let ...\u00a0we\u2019ll get the trivial solution and so in   order to satisfy this boundary condition we\u2019ll need to require instead that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, this   equation has solutions but we\u2019ll need to use some numerical techniques in   order to get them.\u00a0 In order to see   what\u2019s going on here let\u2019s graph ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0on the same graph.\u00a0 Here is that graph and note that the   horizontal axis really is values of ...\u00a0as that will make things a little easier to   see and relate to values that we\u2019re familiar with....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, eigenvalues   for this case will occur where the two curves intersect.\u00a0 We\u2019ve shown the first five on the graph and   again what is showing on the graph is really the square root of the actual   eigenvalue as we\u2019ve noted....\u00a0...The interesting   thing to note here is that the farther out on the graph the closer the   eigenvalues come to the asymptotes of tangent and so we\u2019ll take advantage of   that and say that for large enough ...   we can approximate the eigenvalues with the (very well known) locations of   the\u00a0 asymptotes of tangent. ...\u00a0...How large the   value of ... is before we start using   the approximation will depend on how much accuracy we want, but since we know   the location of the asymptotes and as ...   increases the accuracy of the approximation will increase so it will be easy   enough to check for a given accuracy....\u00a0...For the   purposes of this example we found the first five numerically and then we\u2019ll   use the approximation of the remaining eigenvalues.\u00a0 Here are those values/approximations....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The number in   parenthesis after the first five is the approximate value of the   asymptote.\u00a0 As we can see they are a   little off, but by the time we get to ...\u00a0the error in the approximation is   0.9862%.\u00a0 So less than 1% error by the   time we get to ...\u00a0and it will only get better for larger value   of .......\u00a0...The   eigenfunctions for this case are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...where the   values of ...\u00a0are given above....\u00a0...So, now that   all that work is out of the way let\u2019s take a look at the second case. ...\u00a0...The general   solution

In 2... order differential equations each differential equation could only involve one of these cases.\u00a0 Now, however, that will not necessarily be the case.\u00a0 We could very easily have differential equations that contain each of these cases.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...For instance suppose that we have an 9... order differential equation.\u00a0 The complete list of roots could have 3 roots which only occur once in the list (... real distinct roots), a root with multiplicity 4 (... occurs 4 times in the list) and a set of complex conjugate roots (recall that because the coefficients are all real complex roots will always occur in conjugate pairs)....\u00a0...So, for each ... order differential equation we\u2019ll need to form a set of ... linearly independent functions (... a fundamental set of solutions) in order to get a general solution.\u00a0 In the work that follows we\u2019ll discuss the solutions that we get from each case but we will leave it to you to verify that when we put everything together to form a general solution that we do indeed get a fundamental set of solutions.\u00a0 Recall that in order to this we need to verify that the ... is not zero....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started with the work here.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off by assuming that in the list of roots of the characteristic equation we have ...\u00a0and they only occur once in the list.\u00a0 The solution from each of these will then be,...\u00a0...There\u2019s nothing really new here for real distinct roots....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at repeated roots.\u00a0 The result here is a natural extension of the work we ... in the 2... order case.\u00a0 Let\u2019s suppose that ... is a root of multiplicity ...

(... they occur ... times in the list of roots).\u00a0 In this case we can use the work from the repeated roots above to get the following set of 2... complex-valued solutions,...\u00a0...The problem here of course is that we really want real-valued solutions.\u00a0 So, recall that in the case where they occurred once all we had to do was use ... on the first one and then take the real and imaginary part to get two real valued solutions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do the same thing here and use Euler\u2019s formula on the first set of complex-valued solutions above, split each one into its real and imaginary parts to arrive at the following set of 2... real-valued solutions....\u00a0...\u00a0...Once again we\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that these do in fact form a fundamental set of solutions....\u00a0...Before we work a couple of quick examples here we should point out that the characteristic polynomial is now going to be at least a 3... degree polynomial and finding the roots of these by hand is often a very difficult and time consuming process and in many cases if the roots are not rational (... in the form ...) it can be almost impossible to find them all by hand.\u00a0 To see a process for determining all the rational roots of a polynomial check out the ... page in my Algebra notes.\u00a0 In practice however, we usually use some form of computation aid such as Maple or Mathematica to find all the roots....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s work a couple of example here to illustrate at least some of the ideas discussed here....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....The characteristic equation is,...\u00a0...So we have three real distinct roots here and so the   general solution is,...\u00a0...Differentiating a couple of times and applying the initial   conditions gives the following system of equations that we\u2019ll need to solve   in order to find the coefficients....\u00a0...The actual solution is then,...\u00a0...So, outside of needing to solve a cubic polynomial (which we left the details to you to verify) and needing to solve a system of 3 equations to find the coefficients (which we also left to you to fill in the details) the work here is pretty much identical to the work we did in solving a 2... order IVP. ...\u00a0...Because the initial condition work is identical to work that we should be very familiar with to this point with the exception that it involved solving larger systems we\u2019re going to not bother with solving IVP\u2019s for the rest of the examples.\u00a0 The main point of this section is the new ideas involved in finding the general solution to the differential equation anyway and so we\u2019ll concentrate on that for the remaining examples.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also note that we\u2019ll not be showing very much work in solving the characteristic polynomial.\u00a0 We are using computational aids here and would encourage you to do the same here.\u00a0 Solving these higher degree polynomials is just too much work and would obscure the point of these examples....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s move into a couple of examples where we have more than one case involved in the solution....\u00a0...Solve   the following differential equation....The characteristic equation is,...\u00a0...So, we have two roots here, ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0which is multiplicity of 3.\u00a0 Remember that we\u2019ll get three solutions for   the second root and after the first one we add ...\u2019s only the solution until we reach three solutions....\u00a0...The general solution is then,...\u00a0...Solve   the following differential equation....The characteristic equation is,...\u00a0...So, we have one real root ...\u00a0and a pair of complex roots ...\u00a0each with multiplicity 2.\u00a0 So, the solution for the real root is easy   and for the complex roots we\u2019ll get a total of 4 solutions, 2 will be the ... solutions and two will be the   normal solution each multiplied by t....\u00a0...The general solution is,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now work an example that contains all three of the basic cases just to say that we that we\u2019ve got one work here....\u00a0...Solve   the following differential equation....The characteristic equation is...\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ve got one real distinct root, ...,   and double root, ...,   and a pair of complex roots, ...\u00a0that only occur once....\u00a0...The general solution is then,...\u00a0...We\u2019ve got one final example to work here that on the surface at least seems almost too easy.\u00a0 The problem here will be finding the roots as well see....\u00a0...Solve   the following differential equation....The characteristic equation is...\u00a0...So, a really simple characteristic equation.\u00a0 However, in order to find the roots we need   to compute the fourth root of -16 and that is something that most people   haven\u2019t done at this point in their mathematical career. We\u2019ll just give the   formula here for finding them, but if you\u2019re interested in seeing a little   more about this you might want to check out the ... section of   my .......\u00a0...The 4 (and yes there are 4!) 4... roots of -16   can be found by evaluating the following,...\u00a0\u00a0 ...   ...\u00a0...Note that each   value of ... will give a distinct 4...   root of -16.\u00a0 Also, note that for the 4...   root (and ONLY the 4... root) of any negative number all we need to   do is replace the 16 in the above formula with the absolute value of the   number in question and this formula will work for those as well....\u00a0...Here are the 4...   roots of -16....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we have two sets of complex roots : ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The general solution is,...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve worked a handful of examples here of higher order differential equations that should give you a feel for how these work in most cases.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are of course a great many different kinds of combinations of the basic cases than what we did here and of course we didn\u2019t work any case involving 6... order or higher, but once you\u2019ve got an idea on how these work it\u2019s pretty easy to see that they all work pretty in pretty much the same manner.\u00a0 The biggest problem with the higher order differential equations is that the work in solving the characteristic polynomial and the system for the coefficients on the solution can be quite involved.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/HOHomogeneousDE.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Differential Equations - Homogeneous Differential Equations", "subject": "math"}},

This number is called the .......\u00a0...Determining the radius of convergence for most power series is usually quite simple if we use the ratio test....\u00a0...Given a power series compute,...then,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at how this can be used to determine the radius of convergence....\u00a0...Determine   the radius of convergence for the following power series....So, in this case we have,...Remember that to compute ... all we do is replace all the ...\u2019s in ...   with ...1.\u00a0 Using the ratio test then gives,...\u00a0...Now we know that the series will converge if,...and the series will diverge if,...\u00a0...In other words, the radius of the convergence for this   series is,...\u00a0...As this last example has shown, the radius of convergence is found almost immediately upon using the ratio test....\u00a0...So, why are we worried about the convergence of power series?\u00a0 Well in order for a series solution to a differential equation to exist at a particular ... it will need to be convergent at that ....\u00a0 If it\u2019s not convergent at a given ... then the series solution won\u2019t exist at that ....\u00a0 So, the convergence of power series is fairly important....\u00a0...Next we need to do a quick review of some of the basics of manipulating series.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with addition and subtraction.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There really isn\u2019t a whole lot to addition and subtraction.\u00a0 All that we need to worry about is that the two series start at the same place and both have the same exponent of the ....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If they do then we can perform addition and/or subtraction as follows,...\u00a0...In other words all we do is add or subtract the coefficients and we get the new series....\u00a0...One of the rules that we\u2019re going to have when we get around to finding series solutions to differential equations is that the only ... that we want in a series is the ... that sits in ....\u00a0\u00a0 This means that we will need to be able to deal with series of the form,...where ... is some constant.\u00a0 These are actually quite easy to deal with....\u00a0...So, all we need to do is to multiply the term in front into the series and add exponents.\u00a0 Also note that in order to do this both the coefficient in front of the series and the term inside the series must be in the form ....\u00a0 If they are not the same we can\u2019t do this, we will eventually see how to deal with terms that aren\u2019t in this form....\u00a0...Next we need to talk about differentiation of a power series.\u00a0 By looking at ... it should be fairly easy to see how we will differentiate a power series.\u00a0 Since a series is just a giant summation all we need to do is differentiate the individual terms.\u00a0 The derivative of a power series will be,...\u00a0...So, all we need to do is just differentiate the term inside the series and we\u2019re done.\u00a0 Notice as well that there are in fact two forms of the derivative.\u00a0 Since the ... term of the derivative is zero it won\u2019t change the value of the series and so we can include it or not as we need to.\u00a0 In our work we will usually want the derivative to start at ..., however there will be the occasional problem were it would be more convenient to start it at .......\u00a0...Following how we found the first derivative it should make sense that the second derivative is,...\u00a0...In this case since the ... and ... terms are both zero we can start at any of three possible starting points as determined by the problem that we\u2019re working....\u00a0...Next we need to talk about ....\u00a0 As we will see eventually we are going to want our power series written in terms of ...\u00a0and they often won\u2019t, initially at least, be in that form.\u00a0 To get them into the form we need we will need to perform an index shift....\u00a0...Index shifts themselves really aren\u2019t concerned with the exponent on the ... term, they instead are concerned with where the series starts as the following example shows....\u00a0...Write   the following as a series that starts at ...   instead of .......An index shift is a fairly simple manipulation to   perform.\u00a0 First we will notice that if   we define ... then when ... we will have ....\u00a0 So what we\u2019ll do is   rewrite the series in terms of ...   instead of ....\u00a0 We can do this by noting that ....\u00a0   So, everywhere we see an ...   in the actual series term we will replace it with an ....\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The upper limit won\u2019t change in this process since   infinity minus three is still infinity....\u00a0...The final step is to realize that the letter we use for   the index doesn\u2019t matter and so we can just switch back to ...\u2019s....\u00a0...Now, we usually don\u2019t go through this process to do an index shift.\u00a0 All we do is notice that we dropped the starting point in the series by 3 and everywhere else we saw an ... in the series we increased it by 3.\u00a0 In other words, all the ...\u2019s in the series move in the opposite direction that we moved the starting point....\u00a0...Write   the following as a series that starts at ...   instead of .......To start the series to start at ... all we need to do is notice that this means we will increase   the starting point by 2 and so all the other ...\u2019s will need to decrease by 2.\u00a0   Doing this for the series in the previous example would give,...\u00a0...Now, as we noted when we started this discussion about index shift the whole point is to get our series into terms of ....\u00a0 We can see in the previous example that we did exactly that with an index shift.\u00a0 The original exponent on the ... was ....\u00a0 To get this down to an ... we needed to decrease the exponent by 2.\u00a0 This can be done with an index that increases the starting point by 2....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of more examples of this....\u00a0...Write   each of the following as a single series in terms of .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, notice that there are two series here and the   instructions clearly ask for only a single series.\u00a0 So, we will need to subtract the two series   at some point in time.\u00a0 The vast   majority of our work will be to get the two series prepared for the   subtraction.\u00a0 This means that the two   series can\u2019t have any coefficients in front of them (other than one of   course\u2026), they will need to start at the same value of ... and they will need the same exponent on the ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll almost always want to take care of any coefficients   first.\u00a0 So, we have one in front of the   first series so let\u2019s multiply that into the first series.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Now, the instructions specify that the new series must be   in terms of ...,   so that\u2019s the next thing that we\u2019ve got to take care of.\u00a0 We will do this by an index shift on each   of the series.\u00a0 The exponent on the   first series needs to go up by two so we\u2019ll shift the first series down by   2.\u00a0 On the second series will need to   shift up by 1 to get the exponent to move down by 1.\u00a0 Performing the index shifts gives us the   following,...\u00a0...Finally, in order to subtract the two series we\u2019ll need to   get them to start at the same value of ....\u00a0 Depending on the series in the problem we   can do this in a variety of ways.\u00a0 In   this case let\u2019s notice that since there is an ... in the second series we can in fact start the second series   at ... without changing its   value.\u00a0 Also note that in doing so we   will get both of the series to start at ...   and so we can do the subtraction.\u00a0 Our   final answer is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this part the main issue is the fact that we can\u2019t just   multiply the coefficient into the series this time since the coefficient   doesn\u2019t have the same form as the term inside the series.\u00a0 Therefore, the first thing that we\u2019ll need   to do is correct the coefficient so that we can bring it into the   series.\u00a0 We do this as follows,...\u00a0...We can now move the coefficient into the series, but in   the process of we managed to pick up a second series.\u00a0 This will happen so get used to it.\u00a0 Moving the coefficients of both series in   gives,...\u00a0...We now need to get the exponent in both series to be an ....\u00a0   This will mean shifting the first series up by 4 and the second series   up by 3.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...In this case we can\u2019t just start the first series at ... because there is not an ... sitting in that series to make the   ... term zero.\u00a0 So, we won\u2019t be able to do this part as we   did in the first part of this example....\u00a0...What we\u2019ll need to do in this part is strip out the ... from the second series so they   will both start at ....\u00a0 We will then be able to add the two series   together.\u00a0 Stripping out the ... term from the second series gives,...\u00a0...We can now add the two series together....\u00a0...This is what we\u2019re looking for.\u00a0 We won\u2019t worry about the extra term sitting   in front of the series.\u00a0 When we   finally get around to finding series solutions to differential equations we   will see how to deal with that term there....\u00a0...There is one final fact that we need take care of before moving on.\u00a0 Before giving this fact for power series let\u2019s notice that the only way for...to be zero for all ... is to have .... ...\u00a0...We\u2019ve got a similar fact for power series....\u00a0...If,...for all ...

write both portions as a power series.\u00a0 This is also our solution.\u00a0 We are done....\u00a0...Before working another problem let\u2019s take a look at the solution to the previous example.\u00a0 First, we started out by saying that we wanted a series solution of the form,...and we didn\u2019t get that.\u00a0 We got a solution that contained two different power series.\u00a0 Also, each of the solutions had an unknown constant in them.\u00a0 This is not a problem.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s what we want to have happen.\u00a0 From our ... with second order constant coefficient differential equations we know that the solution to the differential equation in the last example is,...\u00a0...Solutions to second order differential equations consist of two separate functions each with an unknown constant in front of them that are found by applying any initial conditions.\u00a0 So, the form of our solution in the last example is exactly what we want to get.\u00a0 Also recall that the following ... series,...\u00a0...Recalling these we very quickly see that what we got from the series solution method was exactly the solution we got from first principles, with the exception that the functions were the ... series for the actual functions instead of the actual functions themselves....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s work an example with nonconstant coefficients since that is where series solutions are most useful....\u00a0...Find   a series solution around ...\u00a0for the following differential equation....As with the first example ... and so again for this differential equation every point is   an ordinary point.\u00a0 Now we\u2019ll start   this one out just as we did the first example.\u00a0 Let\u2019s write down the form of the solution   and get its derivatives....\u00a0...Plugging into the differential equation gives,...\u00a0...Unlike the first example we first need to get all the   coefficients moved into the series....\u00a0...Now we will need to shift the first series down by 2 and   the second series up by 1 to get both of the series in terms of .......\u00a0...Next we need to get the two series starting at the same   value of ....\u00a0 The only way to do that for this problem is   to strip out the ... term....\u00a0...We now need to set all the coefficients equal to   zero.\u00a0 We will need to be careful with   this however.\u00a0 The ... coefficient is in front of the series and the ... are all in the series. \u00a0So, setting coefficient equal to zero gives,...\u00a0...Solving the first as well as the

there is nothing from the first   example that can be reused here.\u00a0   Changing to ...\u00a0completely changes the problem.\u00a0 In this case our solution will be,...The derivatives of the solution are,...\u00a0...Plug these into the differential equation....\u00a0...We now run into our first real difference between this   example and the previous example.\u00a0 In   this case we can\u2019t just multiply the ...   into the second series since in order to combine with the series it must be ....\u00a0   Therefore we will first need to modify the coefficient of the second   series before multiplying it into the series....\u00a0...We now have three series to work with.\u00a0 This will often occur in these kinds of   problems.\u00a0 Now we will need to shift   the first series down by 2 and the second series up by 1 the get common   exponents in all the series....\u00a0...In order to combine the series we will need to strip out   the ... terms from both the first   and third series....\u00a0...Setting coefficients equal to zero gives,...\u00a0...We now need to solve both of these.\u00a0 In the first case there are two options, we   can solve for ... or we   can solve for ....\u00a0 Out of habit I\u2019ll solve for ....\u00a0 In the recurrence relation we\u2019ll solve for   the term with the largest subscript as in previous examples....Notice that in this example we won\u2019t be having every third   term drop out as we did in the previous example....\u00a0...At this point we\u2019ll also acknowledge that the instructions   for this problem are different as well.\u00a0   We aren\u2019t going to get a general formula for the ...\u2019s this time so we\u2019ll have to be satisfied with just   getting the first couple of terms for each portion of the solution.\u00a0 This is often the case for series   solutions.\u00a0 Getting general formulas   for the ...\u2019s is the   exception rather than the rule in these kinds of problems....\u00a0...To get the first four terms we\u2019ll just start plugging in   terms until we\u2019ve got the required number of terms.\u00a0 Note that we will already be starting with an   ...

we need....\u00a0...Now, all that we need to do is plug into our solution....\u00a0...Finally collect all the terms up with the same coefficient   and factor out the coefficient to get,...\u00a0...That\u2019s the solution for this problem as far as we\u2019re   concerned.\u00a0 Notice that this solution   looks nothing like the solution to the previous example.\u00a0 It\u2019s the same differential equation, but   changing ... completely   changed the solution....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one final problem....\u00a0...Find   the first four terms in each portion of the series solution around ...\u00a0for the following differential equation....We finally have a differential equation that doesn\u2019t have   a constant coefficient for the second derivative....\u00a0...So

the first term into two so we can multiply   the coefficient into the series and multiply the coefficients of the second   and third series in as well....\u00a0...We will only need to shift the second series down by two   to get all the exponents the same in all the series....\u00a0...At this point we could strip out some terms to get all the   series starting at ..., but that\u2019s   actually more work than is needed.\u00a0   Let\u2019s instead note that we could start the third series at ... if we wanted to because that term   is just zero.\u00a0 Likewise the terms in   the first series

zero.\u00a0 In this case both of the series   in the solution will terminate.\u00a0 This   won\u2019t always happen, and often only one of them will terminate....\u00a0...The solution in this case

one direction   before turning around and moving off into the other direction.\u00a0 The directions in which they move are   opposite depending on which side of the trajectory corresponding to the   eigenvector we are on.\u00a0 Also, as the   trajectories move away from the origin it should start becoming parallel to   the trajectory corresponding to the eigenvector....\u00a0...So, how do we determine the direction?\u00a0 We can do the same thing that we did in the   complex case.\u00a0 We\u2019ll plug in (1,0) into   the system and see which direction the trajectories are moving at that   point.\u00a0 Since this point is directly to   the right of the origin the trajectory at that point must have already turned   around and so this will give the direction that it will traveling after   turning around....\u00a0...Doing that for this problem to check our phase portrait   gives,...\u00a0...This vector will point down into the fourth quadrant and   so the trajectory must be moving into

example....\u00a0...Two   1000 liter tanks are with salt water.\u00a0   Tank 1 contains 800 liters of water initially containing 20 grams of   salt dissolved in it and tank 2 contains 1000 liters of water and initially   has 80 grams of salt dissolved in it.\u00a0   Salt water with a concentration of ...\u00a0gram/liter of salt enters tank 1 at a rate   of 4 liters/hour.\u00a0 Fresh water enters   tank 2 at a rate of 7 liters/hour.\u00a0   Through a connecting pipe water flows from tank 2 into tank 1 at a   rate of 10 liters/hour.\u00a0 Through a   different connecting pipe 14 liters/hour flows out of tank 1 and 11   liters/hour are drained out of the pipe (and hence out of the system completely)   and only 3 liters/hour flows back into tank 2.\u00a0 Set up the system that will give the amount   of salt in each tank at any given time.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, let ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0be the amount of salt in tank 1 and tank 2   at any time ... respectively.\u00a0 Now all we need to do is set up a   differential equation for each tank just as we did back when we had a single   tank.\u00a0 The only difference is that we   now need to deal with the fact that we\u2019ve got a second inflow to each tank   and the concentration of the second inflow will be the concentration of the   other tank....\u00a0...Recall that the basic differential equation is the rate of   change of salt (...) equals the rate at which salt   enters minus the rate at salt leaves.\u00a0   Each entering/leaving rate is found by multiplying the flow rate times   the concentration....\u00a0...Here is the differential equation for tank 1....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this differential equation the first pair of numbers is   the salt entering from the external inflow.\u00a0   The second set of numbers is the salt that entering into the tank from   the water flowing in from tank 2.\u00a0 The   third set is the salt leaving tank as water flows out....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the second differential equation....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that because the external inflow into tank 2 is fresh   water the concentration of salt in this is zero....\u00a0...In summary here is the system we\u2019d need to solve,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is a   nonhomogeneous system because of the first term in the first differential equation.\u00a0 If we had fresh water flowing into both of   these we would in fact have a homogeneous system....\u00a0...The next type of problem to look at is the population problem.\u00a0 Back in the first order ... section we looked at some population problems.\u00a0 In those problems we looked at a single population and often included some form of predation.\u00a0 The problem in that section was we assumed that the amount of predation would be constant.\u00a0 This however clearly won\u2019t be the case in most situations.\u00a0 The amount of predation will depend upon the population of the predators and the population of the predators will depend, as least partially, upon the population of the prey....\u00a0...So, in order to more accurately (well at least more accurate than what we originally did) we really need to set up a model that will cover both populations, both the predator and the prey.\u00a0 These types of problems are usually called ... problems.\u00a0 Here are the assumptions that we\u2019ll make when we build up this model....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, given these assumptions let\u2019s write down the system for this case....\u00a0...Write   down the system of differential equations for the population of predators and   prey using the assumptions above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll start off by letting ... represent the population of the predators and ... represent the population of the   prey....\u00a0...Now, the first assumption tells us that, in the absence of   predators, the prey will grow at a rate of ...\u00a0where ....\u00a0 Likewise the second assumption tells us   that, in the absence of prey, the predators will decrease at a rate of ...\u00a0where .......\u00a0...Next, the third and fourth assumptions tell us how the   population is affected by encounters between predators and prey.\u00a0 So, with each encounter the population of   the predators will increase at a rate of ...\u00a0and the population of the prey will decrease   at a rate of ...\u00a0where ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Putting all of this together we arrive at the following   system....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that this   is a nonlinear system and we\u2019ve not (nor will we here) discuss how to solve   this kind of system.\u00a0 We simply wanted   to give a \u201cbetter\u201d model for some population problems and to point out that   not all systems will be nice and simple linear systems....\u00a0...When we first looked at ... we looked at a single mass hanging on a spring with the possibility of both a damper and/or an external force acting on the mass.\u00a0 Here we want to look at the following situation....\u00a0...In the figure above we are assuming that the system is at rest.\u00a0 In other words all three springs are currently at their natural lengths and are not exerting any forces on either of the two masses and that there are no currently any external forces acting on either mass....\u00a0...We will use the following assumptions about this situation once we start the system in motion....\u00a0...\u00a0...Before writing down the system for this case recall that the force exerted by the spring on the each mass is the spring constant times the amount that the spring has been compressed or stretched and we\u2019ll need to be careful with signs to make sure that the force is acting in the correct direction....\u00a0...Write   down the system of differential equations for the spring and mass system   above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To help us out let\u2019s first take a quick look at a   situation in which both of the masses have been moved.\u00a0 This is shown below....\u00a0...Before   proceeding let\u2019s note that this is only a representation of a typical case,   but most definitely not all possible cases.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...In this case   we\u2019re assuming that both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are positive and that ...,   or in other words, both masses have been moved to the right of their   respective equilibrium points and that ...\u00a0has been moved farther than ....\u00a0 So, under these assumption on\u00a0 ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we know that the spring on the left (with   spring constant ...) has been stretched past it\u2019s   natural length while the middle spring (spring constant ...) and the right spring (spring   constant ...) are both under compression....\u00a0...Also, we\u2019ve   shown the external forces, ...\u00a0and ...,   as present and acting in the positive direction.\u00a0 They do not, in practice, need to be   present in every situation in which case we will assume that ...\u00a0and/or ....\u00a0 Likewise, if the forces are in fact acting   in the negative direction we will then assume that ...\u00a0and/or .......\u00a0...Before   proceeding we need to talk a little bit about how the middle spring will   behave as the masses move.\u00a0 Here are   all the possibilities that we can have and the affect each will have on ....\u00a0 Note that in each case the amount of   compression/stretch in the spring is given by ...\u00a0although we won\u2019t be using the absolute   value bars when we set up the differential equations....\u00a0...1. If both mass move the same amount   in the same direction then the middle spring will not have changed length and   we\u2019ll have ....\u00a0 ...   ...   ...2. If both masses move in the   positive direction then the sign of ...\u00a0will tell us which has moved more. If ...\u00a0moves more than ...\u00a0then the spring will be in compression and ....\u00a0 Likewise, if ...\u00a0moves more than ...\u00a0then the spring will have been stretched and   .......   ...   ...3. If both masses move in the   negative direction we\u2019ll have pretty much the opposite behavior as #2.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0moves more than ...\u00a0then the spring will have been stretched and   ....\u00a0 Likewise, if ...\u00a0moves more than ...\u00a0then the spring will be in compression and .......   ...   ...4. If ...\u00a0moves in the positive direction and ...\u00a0moves in the negative direction then the   spring will be in compression and .......   ...   ...5. Finally, if\u00a0 ...\u00a0moves in the negative direction and ...\u00a0moves in the positive direction then the   spring will have been stretched and .......\u00a0...Now, we\u2019ll use   the figure above to help us develop the differential equations (the figure   corresponds to case 2 above\u2026) and then make sure that they will also hold for   the other cases as well....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off   by getting the differential equation for the forces acting on ....\u00a0 Here is a quick sketch of the forces acting   on ...\u00a0for the figure above....In this case ...\u00a0and so the first spring has been stretched   and so will exert a negative (...   to the left) force on the mass.\u00a0 The   force from the first spring is then ...\u00a0and the \u201c-\u201d is needed because the force is   negative but both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are positive....\u00a0...Next, because   we\u2019re assuming that ...\u00a0has moved more than ...\u00a0and both have moved in the positive   direction we also know that ....\u00a0 Because ...\u00a0has moved more than ...\u00a0we know that the second spring will be under   compression and so the force should be acting in the negative direction on ...\u00a0and so the force will be ....\u00a0 Note that because ...\u00a0is positive and ...\u00a0is negative this force will have the correct   sign (... negative)....\u00a0...The   differential equation for ...\u00a0is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that this   will also hold for all the other cases.\u00a0   If ...\u00a0has been moved in the negative direction the   force form the spring on the right that acts on the mass will be positive and   ...\u00a0will be a positive quantity in this   case.\u00a0 Next, if the middle is has been   stretched (... ...) then the force from this spring on ...\u00a0will be in the positive direction and ...\u00a0will be a positive quantity in this   case.\u00a0 Therefore, this differential   equation holds for all cases not just the one we illustrated at the start of   this problem....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now write   down the differential equation for all the forces that are acting on ....\u00a0 Here is a sketch of the forces acting on   this mass for the situation sketched out in the figure above....In this case ...\u00a0is positive and so the spring on the right   is under compression and will exert a negative force on ...\u00a0and so this force should be ...,   where the \u201c-\u201d is required because both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are positive.\u00a0 Also, the middle spring is still under   compression but the force that it exerts on this mass is now a positive   force, unlike in the case of ...,   and so is given by ....\u00a0 The \u201c-\u201d on this force is required because ...\u00a0is negative and the force must be positive....\u00a0...The   differential equation for ...\u00a0is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave it   to you to verify that this differential equation does in fact hold for all   the other cases....\u00a0...Putting all of   this together and doing a little rewriting will then give the following   system of differential equations for this situation....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is a   system to two linear second order differential equations that may or may not   be nonhomogeneous depending whether there are any external forces, ...\u00a0and ...,   acting on the masses.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We have not talked about how to solve systems of second order differential equations.\u00a0 However, it can be converted to a system of first order differential equations as the next example shows and in many cases we could solve that....\u00a0...Convert   the system from the previous example to a system of 1... order   differential equations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This isn\u2019t too   hard to do.\u00a0 ... that we did this for   single higher order differential equations earlier in the chapter when we   first started to look at systems.\u00a0 To   convert this to a system of first order differential equations we can make   the following definitions....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We can then   convert each of the differential equations as we did earlier in the chapter....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Eliminating the   \u201cmiddle\u201d step we get the following system of first order differential   equations....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The matrix form   of this system would be,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...While we never   discussed how to solve systems of more than two linear first order   differential equations we know most of what we need to solve this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In an earlier ... we discussed briefly solving   nonhomogeneous systems and all of that information is still valid here.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...For the   homogenous system, that we\u2019d still need to solve for the general solution to   the nonhomogeneous system, we know most of what we need to know in order to   solve this.\u00a0 The only issues that we   haven\u2019t dealt with are what to do with repeated complex eigenvalues (which   are now a possibility) and what to do with eigenvalues of multiplicity   greater than 2 (which are again now a possibility).", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/SystemsModeling.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "It\u2019s now time to start solving systems of differential equations.\u00a0 We\u2019ve ... that solutions to the system,...will be of the

..., where the determinant of the matrix,...is nonzero....\u00a0...We are going to start by looking at the case where our two eigenvalues, ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are real and distinct.\u00a0 In other words they will be real, simple eigenvalues.\u00a0 ... as well that the eigenvectors for simple eigenvalues are linearly independent.\u00a0 This means that the solutions we get from these will also be linearly independent.\u00a0 If the solutions are linearly independent the matrix ... must be nonsingular and hence these two solutions will be a fundamental set of solutions.\u00a0 The general solution in this case will then be,...\u00a0...Note that each of our examples will actually be broken into two examples.\u00a0 The first example will be solving the system and the second example will be sketching the phase portrait for the system.\u00a0 Phase portraits are not always taught in a differential equations course and so we\u2019ll strip those out of the solution process so that if you haven\u2019t covered them in your class you can ignore the phase portrait example for the system....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....So, the first thing that we need to do is find the   eigenvalues for the matrix....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s find the eigenvectors for each of these....\u00a0...\u00a0:...We\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...The eigenvector in this case is,...\u00a0:...We\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...The eigenvector in this case is,...\u00a0...Then general solution is then,...\u00a0...Now, we need to find the constants.\u00a0 To do this we simply need to apply the   initial conditions....\u00a0...All we need to do now is multiply the constants through   and we then get two equations (one for each row) that we can solve for the   constants.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...The solution is then,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at the phase portrait for the system....\u00a0...Sketch   the phase portrait for the following system....From the last example we know that the eigenvalues and   eigenvectors for this system are,...\u00a0...It turns out that this is all the information that we will   need to sketch the direction field.\u00a0 We   will relate things back to our solution however so that we can see that   things are going correctly....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start by sketching lines that follow the direction of   the two eigenvectors.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...Now, from the first example our general solution is...If we have ...   = 0 then the solution is an exponential times a vector and all that the   exponential does is affect the magnitude of the vector and the constant ... will affect both the   sign and the magnitude of the vector.\u00a0   In other words, the trajectory in this case will be a straight line   that is parallel to the vector, ....\u00a0 Also notice that as ... increases the exponential will get smaller and smaller and   hence the trajectory will be moving in towards the origin.\u00a0 If ...   the trajectory will be in Quadrant II and if ... the trajectory will be in Quadrant IV....\u00a0...So the line in the graph above marked with ...\u00a0will be a sketch of the trajectory   corresponding to ... = 0   and this trajectory will approach the origin as ... increases. ...\u00a0...If we now turn things around and look at the solution   corresponding to having ...   = 0 we will have a trajectory that is parallel to ....\u00a0 Also, since the exponential will increase   as ... increases and so in this case   the trajectory will now move away from the origin as ... increases.\u00a0 We will   denote this with arrows on the lines in the graph above....\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that we could have gotten this information with   actually going to the solution.\u00a0 All we   really need to do is look at the eigenvalues. \u00a0Eigenvalues that are negative will   correspond to solutions that will move towards the origin as ... increases in a direction that is   parallel to its eigenvector.\u00a0 Likewise,   eigenvalues that are positive move away from the origin as ... increases in a direction that will   be parallel to its eigenvector....\u00a0...If both constants are in the solution we will have a   combination of these behaviors.\u00a0 For   large negative ...\u2019s the solution   will be dominated by the portion that has the negative eigenvalue since in   these cases the exponent will be large and positive.\u00a0 Trajectories for large negative ...\u2019s will be parallel to ...\u00a0and moving in the same direction.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Solutions for large positive ...\u2019s will be dominated by the portion with the positive   eigenvalue.\u00a0 Trajectories in this case   will be parallel to ...\u00a0and moving in the same direction....\u00a0...In general, it looks like trajectories will start \u201cnear\u201d ...,   move in towards the origin and then as they get closer to the origin they   will start moving towards ...\u00a0and then continue up along this vector.\u00a0 Sketching some of these in will give the   following phase portrait.\u00a0 Here is a   sketch of this with the trajectories corresponding to the eigenvectors marked   in blue....\u00a0...In this case the equilibrium solution (0,0) is called a ... and is unstable.\u00a0 In this case unstable means that solutions move away from it as ... increases....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve solved a system in matrix form, but remember that we started out without the systems in matrix form.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s take a quick look at an example of a system that isn\u2019t in matrix form initially....\u00a0...Find   the solution to the following system....We first need to convert this into matrix form.\u00a0 This is easy enough.\u00a0 Here is the matrix form of the system....\u00a0...This is just the system from the first example and so   we\u2019ve already got the solution to this system.\u00a0 Here it is....\u00a0...Now, since we want the solution to the system not in matrix   form let\u2019s go one step farther here.\u00a0   Let\u2019s multiply the constants and exponentials into the vectors and   then add up the two vectors....\u00a0...Now, recall,...\u00a0...So, the solution to the system is then,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another example....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....So, the first thing that we need to do is find the   eigenvalues for the matrix....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s find the eigenvectors for each of these....\u00a0...\u00a0:...We\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...The eigenvector in this case is,...\u00a0:...We\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...The eigenvector in this case is,...\u00a0...Then general solution is then,...\u00a0...Now, we need to find the constants.\u00a0 To do this we simply need to apply the   initial conditions....\u00a0...Now solve the system for the constants....\u00a0...The solution is then,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s find the phase portrait for this system....\u00a0...Sketch   the phase portrait for the following system....\u00a0...From the last example we know that the eigenvalues and   eigenvectors for this system are,...\u00a0...This one is a little different from the first one.\u00a0 However it starts in the same way.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first sketch the trajectories   corresponding to the eigenvectors.\u00a0   Notice as well that both of the eigenvalues are negative and so   trajectories for these will move in towards the origin as ... increases.\u00a0 When we sketch the trajectories we\u2019ll add   in arrows to denote the direction they take as ... increases.\u00a0 Here is the   sketch of these trajectories....Now, here is where the slight difference from the first   phase portrait comes up.\u00a0 All of the   trajectories will move in towards the origin as ... increases since both of the eigenvalues are negative.\u00a0 The issue that we need to decide upon is   just how they do this.\u00a0 This is   actually easier than it might appear to be at first....\u00a0...The second eigenvalue is larger than the first.\u00a0 For large and positive ...\u2019s this means that the solution for this eigenvalue will be   smaller than the solution for the first eigenvalue.\u00a0 Therefore, as ... increases the trajectory will move in towards the origin and do   so parallel to ....\u00a0 Likewise, since the second eigenvalue is   larger than the first this solution will dominate for large and negative ...\u2019s.\u00a0   Therefore, as we decrease ...   the trajectory will move away from the origin and do so parallel to .......\u00a0...Adding in some trajectories gives the following sketch....\u00a0...In these cases we call the equilibrium solution (0,0) a ... and it is asymptotically   stable.\u00a0 Equilibrium solutions are   asymptotically stable if all the trajectories move in towards it as ... increases....\u00a0...Note that nodes can also be unstable.\u00a0 In the last example if both of the eigenvalues had been positive all the trajectories would have moved away from the origin and in this case the equilibrium solution would have been unstable....\u00a0...Before moving on to the next section we need to do one more example.\u00a0 When we first started talking about systems it was mentioned that we can convert a higher order differential equation into a system.\u00a0 We need to do an example like this so we can see how to solve higher order differential equations using systems....\u00a0...Convert   the following differential equation into a system, solve the system and use   this solution to get the solution to the original differential equation....So, we first need to convert this into a system.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the change of variables,...\u00a0...The system is then,...where,...\u00a0...Now we need to find the eigenvalues for the matrix....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s find the eigenvectors....\u00a0...\u00a0:...We\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...The eigenvector in this case is,...\u00a0...:...We\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...The eigenvector in this case is,...\u00a0...The general solution is then,...\u00a0...Apply the initial condition....\u00a0...This gives the system of equations that we can solve for   the constants....\u00a0...The actual solution to the system is then,...\u00a0...Now recalling that,...we can see that the solution to the original differential   equation is just the top row of the solution to the matrix system.\u00a0 The solution to the original differential   equation is then,...\u00a0...Notice that as a check, in this case, the bottom row   should be the derivative of the top row.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/RealEigenvalues.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Differential

However, there are some problems where this approach won\u2019t easily work.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at one of those kinds of problems....\u00a0...A   tank in the shape of an inverted cone has a height of 15 meters and a base   radius of 4 meters and is filled with water to a depth of 12 meters.\u00a0 Determine the amount of work needed to pump   all of the water to the top of the tank.\u00a0   Assume that the density of the water is 1000 kg/m.......\u00a0...Okay, in this case we cannot just determine a force   function, ...\u00a0that will work for us.\u00a0 So, we are going to need to approach this   from a different standpoint.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s first set ...\u00a0to be the lower end of the tank/cone and ...\u00a0to be the top of the tank/cone.\u00a0 With this ... of our ...\u2019s   we can now see that the water in the tank will correspond to the interval .......\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start off by dividing ...\u00a0into ...   subintervals each of width ...\u00a0and let\u2019s also let ...\u00a0be any point from the ... subinterval where ....\u00a0 Now, for each subinterval we will   approximate the water in the tank corresponding to that interval as a   cylinder of radius ...\u00a0and height .......\u00a0...Here is a quick sketch of the tank.\u00a0 Note that the sketch really isn\u2019t to scale   and we are looking at the tank from directly in

because we   are approximating the water in the ...   subinterval as a cylinder we can easily approximate the volume, ...,\u00a0 and hence the mass of the water in the ... subinterval....\u00a0...The

of water we need to overcome the force of gravity that is acting on   the volume and that is, ...,   where ...\u00a0is the gravitational acceleration.\u00a0 The force to raise the volume of water in

...\u00a0...Next, in order   to reach to the top of the tank the water in the ... subinterval will need to travel approximately ...\u00a0to reach the top of the tank.\u00a0 Because the volume of the

rings or disks, found the cross-sectional area and then used the following formulas to find the volume of the solid....\u00a0...In the previous section we only used cross sections that were in the shape of a disk or a ring.\u00a0 This however does not always need to be the case.\u00a0 We can use any shape for the cross sections as long as it can be expanded or contracted to completely cover the solid we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 This is a good thing because as our first example will show us we can\u2019t always use rings/disks....\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by ...and the ...-axis about the ...-axis....\u00a0...As we did in the previous section, let\u2019s first graph the   bounded region and solid.\u00a0 Note that   the bounded region here is the shaded portion shown.\u00a0 The curve is extended out a little past   this for the purposes of illustrating what the curve looks like....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve basically got something that\u2019s roughly doughnut   shaped.\u00a0 If we were to use rings on   this solid here is what a typical ring would look like....\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...This leads to several problems.\u00a0 First, both the inner and outer radius are   defined by the same function.\u00a0 This, in   itself, can be dealt with on occasion as we saw in a example in the ...   section.\u00a0 However, this usually means   more work than other methods so it\u2019s often not the best approach....\u00a0...This leads to the second problem we got here.\u00a0 In order to use rings we would need to put   this function into the form ....\u00a0   That is NOT easy in general for a cubic polynomial and in other cases   may not even be possible to do.\u00a0\u00a0 Even   when it is possible to do this the resulting equation is often significantly   messier than the original which can also cause problems....\u00a0...The last problem with rings in this case is not so much a   problem as it's just added work.\u00a0 If we   were to use rings the limit would be ...   limits and this means that we will need to know how high the graph goes.\u00a0 To this point the limits of integration   have always been intersection points that were fairly easy to find.\u00a0 However, in this case the highest point is   not an intersection point, but instead a relative maximum.\u00a0\u00a0 We spent several sections in the   Applications of Derivatives chapter talking about how to find maximum values   of functions.\u00a0 However, finding them   can, on occasion, take some work....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve seen three problems with rings in this case that   will either increase our work load or outright prevent us from using rings....\u00a0...What we need to do is to find a different way to cut the   solid that will give us a cross-sectional area that we can work with.\u00a0 One way to do this is to think of our solid   as a lump of cookie dough and instead of cutting it perpendicular to the axis   of rotation we could instead center a cylindrical cookie cutter on the axis   of rotation and push this down into the solid.\u00a0 Doing this would give the following   picture,...\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Doing this gives us a cylinder or shell in the object and   we can easily find its surface area.\u00a0   The surface area of this cylinder is,...Notice as well that as we increase the radius of the   cylinder we will completely cover the solid and so we can use this in our   formula to find the volume of this solid.\u00a0   All we need are limits of integration.\u00a0   The first cylinder will cut into the solid at ...\u00a0and as we increase ... to ...\u00a0we will completely cover both sides of the   solid since expanding the cylinder in one direction will automatically expand   it in the other direction as well....\u00a0...The volume of this solid is then,...\u00a0...The method used in the last example is called the ... or ....\u00a0 The formula for the area in all cases will be,...\u00a0...There are a couple of important differences between this method and the method of rings/disks that we should note before moving on.\u00a0 First, rotation about a vertical axis will give an area that is a function of ... and rotation about a horizontal axis will give an area that is a function of ....\u00a0 This is exactly opposite of the method of rings/disks....\u00a0...Second, we don\u2019t take the complete range of ... or ... for the limits of integration as we did in the previous section.\u00a0 Instead we take a range of ... or ... that will cover one side of the solid.\u00a0 As we noted in the first example if we expand out the radius to cover one side we will automatically expand in the other direction as well to cover the other side....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example....\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by ...,   ...\u00a0and the ...-axis   about the ...-axis....\u00a0...First let\u2019s get a graph of the bounded region and the solid....\u00a0 ...Okay, we are rotating about a horizontal axis.\u00a0 This means that the area will be a function   of ... and so our equation will also   need to be written in ...\u00a0form....\u00a0...As we did in the ring/disk section let\u2019s take a couple of   looks at a typical cylinder.\u00a0 The   sketch on the left shows a typical cylinder with the back half of the object   also in the sketch to give the right sketch some context.\u00a0 The sketch on the right contains a typical   cylinder and only the curves that define the edge of the solid....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case the width of the cylinder is not the function   value as it was in the previous example.\u00a0   In this case the function value is the distance between the edge of   the cylinder and the ...-axis.\u00a0 The distance from the edge out to the   line is ...\u00a0and so the width is then ....\u00a0\u00a0 The cross sectional area in this case is,...\u00a0...The first cylinder will cut into the solid at ...\u00a0and the final cylinder will cut in at ...\u00a0and so these are our limits of integration....\u00a0...The volume of this solid is,...\u00a0...The remaining examples in this section will have axis of rotation about axis other than the ... and ...-axis.\u00a0 As with the method of rings/disks we will need to be a little careful with these....\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0about the line .......\u00a0...Here\u2019s a graph of the bounded region and solid....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder.\u00a0 Again, the sketch on the left is here to   provide some context for the sketch on the right....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, there is a lot going on in the sketch to the   left.\u00a0 First notice that the radius is   not just an ... or ... as it was in the previous two   cases.\u00a0 In this case ... is the distance from the ...-axis to the edge of the cylinder and   we need the distance from the axis of rotation to the edge of the   cylinder.\u00a0 That means that the radius   of this cylinder is .......\u00a0...Secondly, the height of the cylinder is the difference of   the two functions in this case....\u00a0...The cross sectional area is then,...\u00a0...Now the first cylinder will cut into the solid at ...\u00a0and the final cylinder will cut into the   solid at ... so there are our limits....\u00a0...Here is the volume....\u00a0...The integration of the last term is a little tricky so   let\u2019s do that here.\u00a0 It will use the   substitution,...\u00a0...We saw one of these kinds of substitutions back in the ... section....\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0about the line .......\u00a0...We should first get the intersection points there....\u00a0...So, the two curves will intersect at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Here is a sketch of the bounded region and   the solid....\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here are our sketches of a typical cylinder.\u00a0 The sketch on the left is here to provide   some context for the sketch on the right....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the cross sectional area for this cylinder....\u00a0...The first cylinder will cut into the solid at ...\u00a0and the final cylinder will cut in at ....\u00a0 The volume is then,", "url":

So, the first two proofs are really to be read at that point.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The third proof will work for any real number ....\u00a0 However, it does assume that you\u2019ve read most of the Derivatives chapter and so should only be read after you\u2019ve gone through the whole chapter....\u00a0...In this case as noted above we need to assume that ... is a positive integer.\u00a0 We\u2019ll use the definition of the derivative   and the Binomial Theorem in this theorem.\u00a0   The Binomial Theorem tells us that,...where,...are called the binomial coefficients and ...\u00a0is the factorial....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s go through the details of this proof.\u00a0 First, plug ...\u00a0into the definition of the derivative and   use the Binomial Theorem to expand out the first term....Now, notice that we can cancel an ...\u00a0and then each term in the numerator will   have an ... in them that can be   factored out and then canceled against the ... in the denominator.\u00a0 At   this point we can evaluate the limit....\u00a0...\u00a0...For this proof we\u2019ll again need to restrict ... to be a positive integer.\u00a0 In this case if we define ...\u00a0we know from the alternate limit form of the   definition of the derivative that the derivative ...\u00a0is given by,...\u00a0...Now we have the following formula,...You can verify this if you\u2019d like by simply multiplying   the two factors together.\u00a0 Also, notice   that there are a total of ... terms   in the second factor (this will be important in a bit)....\u00a0...If we plug this into the formula for the derivative we see   that we can cancel the ...\u00a0and then compute the limit....\u00a0...After combining the exponents in each term we can see that   we get the same term.\u00a0 So, then   recalling that there are ... terms in   second factor we can see that we get what we claimed it would be.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To completely finish this off we simply replace the ... with an ... to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...In this proof we no longer need to restrict ... to be a positive integer.\u00a0 It can now be any real number.\u00a0 However, this proof also assumes that   you\u2019ve read all the way through the Derivative chapter.\u00a0 In particular it needs both ... and ....\u00a0 If you\u2019ve not   read, and understand, these sections then this proof will not make any sense   to you. ...\u00a0...So, to get set up for logarithmic differentiation let\u2019s   first define ...\u00a0then take the log of both sides, simplify   the right side using logarithm properties and then differentiate using   implicit differentiation....\u00a0...Finally, all we need to do is solve for ...\u00a0and then substitute in for .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Before moving onto the next proof, let\u2019s notice that in all three proofs we did require that the exponent, ..., be a number (integer in the first two, any real number in the third).\u00a0 In the first proof we couldn\u2019t have used the Binomial Theorem if the exponent wasn\u2019t a positive integer.\u00a0 In the second proof we couldn\u2019t have factored ...\u00a0if the exponent hadn\u2019t been a positive integer.\u00a0 Finally, in the third proof we would have gotten a much different derivative if ... had not been a constant....\u00a0...This is important because people will often misuse the power rule and use it even when the exponent is not a number and/or the base is not a variable....\u00a0...\u00a0...As with the Power Rule above, the Product Rule can be proved either by using the definition of the derivative or it can be proved using Logarithmic Differentiation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll show both proofs here....\u00a0...This proof can be a little tricky when you first see it so   let\u2019s be a little careful here.\u00a0 We\u2019ll   first use the definition of the derivative on the product....\u00a0...On the surface this appears to do nothing for us.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first need to manipulate things a   little to get the proof going.\u00a0 What   we\u2019ll do is subtract out and add in ...\u00a0to the numerator.\u00a0 Note that we\u2019re really just adding in a   zero here since these two terms will cancel.\u00a0   This will give us,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that we added the two terms into the middle of the   numerator.\u00a0 As written we can break up   the limit into two pieces.\u00a0 From the   first piece we can factor a ...\u00a0out and we can factor a ...\u00a0out of the second piece.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...At this point we can use limit properties to write,...\u00a0...The individual limits in here are,...\u00a0...The two limits on the left are nothing more than the   definition the derivative for ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0respectively.\u00a0 The upper limit on the right seems a little   tricky, but remember that the limit of a constant is just the constant.\u00a0 In this case since the limit is only   concerned with allowing ... to go to   zero.\u00a0 The key here is to recognize   that changing ... will not change ... and so as far as this limit is   concerned ...\u00a0is a constant.\u00a0 Note that the function is probably not a   constant, however as far as the limit is concerned the function can be   treated as a constant.\u00a0 We get the   lower limit on the right we get simply by plugging ...\u00a0into the function...\u00a0...Plugging all these into the last step gives us,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is a much quicker proof but does presuppose that   you\u2019ve read and understood the ... and ...   sections.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t then this   proof will not make a lot of sense to you....\u00a0...First write call the product ... and take the log of both sides and use a property of logarithms   on the right side....\u00a0...Next, we take the derivative of both sides and solve for .......\u00a0...Finally, all we need to do is plug in for ... and then multiply this through the   parenthesis and we get the Product Rule....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Again, we can do this using the definition of the derivative or with Logarithmic Definition....\u00a0...First plug the quotient into the definition of the   derivative and rewrite the quotient a little....\u00a0...To make our life a little easier we moved the ... in the denominator of the first step   out to the front as a ....\u00a0 We also wrote the numerator as a single   rational expression.\u00a0 This step is   required to make this proof work....\u00a0...Now, for the next step will need to subtract out and add in   ...\u00a0to the numerator....\u00a0...\u00a0...The next step is to rewrite things a little,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that all we did was interchange the two   denominators.\u00a0 Since we are multiplying   the fractions we can do this....\u00a0...Next, the larger fraction can be broken up as follows....\u00a0...In the first fraction we will factor a ...\u00a0out and in the second we will factor a ...\u00a0out.\u00a0   This gives,...\u00a0...We can now use the basic properties of limits to write   this as,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The individual limits are,...\u00a0...The first two limits in each row are nothing more than the   definition the derivative for ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0respectively.\u00a0 The middle limit in the top row we get   simply by plugging in ....\u00a0 The final limit in each row may seem a   little tricky.\u00a0 Recall that the limit   of a constant is just the constant.\u00a0   Well since the limit is only concerned with allowing ... to go to zero as far as its   concerned ...\u00a0and ...are constants since changing ... will not change ....\u00a0 Note that the function   is probably not a constant, however as far as the limit is concerned the   function can be treated as a constant.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Plugging in the limits and doing some rearranging gives,...There\u2019s the quotient rule....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s do the proof using Logarithmic   Differentiation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first call the   quotient ..., take the log of both   sides and use a property of logs on the right side....\u00a0...Next, we take the derivative of both sides and solve for .......\u00a0...Next, plug in ...   and do some simplification to get the quotient rule....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...If ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are both differentiable functions and we   define ...\u00a0then the derivative of ... is .......\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll start off the proof

something   similar.\u00a0 However, we\u2019re going to use a   different set of letters/variables here for reasons that will be apparent in   a bit.\u00a0 So,

road....\u00a0...Okay, to this   point it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ve really done anything that gets us even close   to proving the chain rule.\u00a0 The work   above will turn out to be very important in our proof however so let\u2019s get   going on the proof....\u00a0...What we need to   do here is use the definition of the derivative and evaluate the following

that even   though the notation is more than a little messy if we use ...\u00a0instead of ... we need to remind ourselves here that ... really is a function of .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s now use ...   to rewrite the ...\u00a0and yes the notation is going to be   unpleasant but we\u2019re going to have to deal with it.\u00a0 By using ...,   the numerator in the limit above

...   to further write this as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that we were able to cancel a ...\u00a0to simplify things up a little.\u00a0 Also, note that the ...\u00a0was intentionally left that way to keep the   mess to a minimum here, just remember that ...\u00a0here as that will be important here in a   bit.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now go back and remember   that all this was the numerator of our limit, ....\u00a0 Plugging this into ...

be solids of revolution as we looked at in the previous two sections.\u00a0 There are many solids out there that cannot be generated as solids of revolution, or at least not easily and so we need to take a look at how to do some of these problems....\u00a0...Now, having said that these will not be solids of revolutions they will still be worked in pretty much the same manner.\u00a0 For each solid we\u2019ll need to determine the cross-sectional area, either ...\u00a0or ..., and they use the formulas we used in the previous two sections,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The \u201chard\u201d part of these problems will be determining what the cross-sectional area for each solid is.\u00a0 Each problem will be different and so each cross-sectional area will be determined by different means....\u00a0...Also, before we proceed with any examples we need to acknowledge that the integrals in this section might look a little tricky at first.\u00a0 There are going to be very few numbers in these problems.\u00a0 All of the examples in this section are going to be more general derivation of volume formulas for certain solids.\u00a0 As such we\u2019ll be working with things like circles of radius ... and we\u2019ll not be giving a specific value of ... and we\u2019ll have heights of ... instead of specific heights, .......\u00a0...All the letters in the integrals are going to make the integrals look a little tricky, but all you have to remember is that the ...\u2019s and the ...\u2019s are just letters being used to represent a fixed quantity for the problem, ... it is a constant.\u00a0 So when we integrate we only need to worry about the letter in the differential as that is the variable we\u2019re actually integrating with respect to.\u00a0 All other letters in the integral should be thought of as constants.\u00a0 If you have trouble doing that, just think about what you\u2019d do if the ... was a 2 or the ... was a 3 for example....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with a simple example that we don\u2019t actually need to do an integral that will illustrate how these problems work in general and will get us used to seeing multiple letters in integrals....\u00a0...Find   the volume of a cylinder of radius ...   and height .......\u00a0...Now, as we mentioned before starting this example we   really don\u2019t need to use an integral to find this volume, but it is a good   example to illustrate the method we\u2019ll need to use for these types of   problems....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start off with the sketch of the cylinder below....We\u2019ll center the cylinder on the ...-axis and the cylinder will start at ...\u00a0and end at ...\u00a0as shown.\u00a0   Note that we\u2019re only choosing this particular set up to get an   integral in terms of ... and to make   the limits nice to deal with.\u00a0 There   are many other orientations that we could use....\u00a0...What we need here is to get a formula for the   cross-sectional area at any ....\u00a0 In this case the cross-sectional area is   constant and will be a disk of radius ....\u00a0 Therefore, for any ... we\u2019ll have the following cross-sectional area,...\u00a0...Next the limits for the integral will be ...\u00a0since that is the range of ... in which the cylinder lives.\u00a0 Here is the integral for the volume,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we get the   expected formula.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, recall we   are using ... to represent the radius   of the cylinder.\u00a0 While ... can clearly take different values it   will never change once we start the problem.\u00a0   Cylinders do not change their radius in the middle of a problem and so   as we move along the center of the cylinder (... the ...-axis) ... is a fixed number and won\u2019t   change.\u00a0 In other words it is a   constant that will not change as we change the ....\u00a0 Therefore, because we   integrated with respect to ... the ... will be a constant as far as the   integral is concerned.\u00a0 The ... can then be pulled out of the   integral as shown (although that\u2019s not required, we just did it to make the   point).\u00a0 At this point we\u2019re just   integrating ... and we know how to   do that....\u00a0...When we   evaluate the integral remember that the limits are ... values and so we plug into the ... and NOT the ....\u00a0 Again, remember that ... is just a letter that is being used to represent the radius of the cylinder and, once we start the integration, is   assumed to be a fixed constant.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As noted before   we started this example if you\u2019re having trouble with the ... just think of what you\u2019d do if there   was a 2 there instead of an ....\u00a0 In this problem, because we\u2019re integrating   with respect to ..., both the 2 and   the ... will behave in the same   manner.\u00a0 Note however that you should   NEVER actually replace the ... with a   2 as that WILL lead to a wrong answer.\u00a0   You should just think of what you would do IF the ... was a 2....\u00a0...So, to work these problems we\u2019ll first need to get a sketch of the solid with a set of ... and ... axes to help us see what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 At the very least we\u2019ll need the sketch to get the limits of the integral, but we will often need it to see just what the cross-sectional area is.\u00a0 Once we have the sketch we\u2019ll need to determine a formula for the cross-sectional area and then do the integral....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of more complicated examples.\u00a0 In these examples the main issue is going to be determining what the cross-sectional areas are. ...\u00a0...Find   the volume of a pyramid whose base is a square with sides of length ... and whose height is .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with a sketch of the pyramid.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll center the pyramid on   the ...-axis and to make the   equations easier we are going to position the point of the pyramid at the   origin. ...\u00a0...Now, as shown here the cross-sectional area will be a   function of ... and it will also be a   square with sides of length ....\u00a0 The area of the square is easy, but we\u2019ll   need to get the length of the side in terms of ....\u00a0 To determine this   consider the figure on the right above.\u00a0   If we look at the pyramid directly from the front we\u2019ll see that we   have two similar triangles and we know that the ratio of any two sides of   similar triangles must be equal.\u00a0 In   other words, we know that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

...\u00a0...Again, do not get excited about the ... and the ... in the   integral.\u00a0 Once we start the problem if   we change ... they will not change   and so they are constants as far as the integral is concerned and can get   pulled out of the integral.\u00a0 Also,   remember that when we evaluate will only plug the limits into the variable we   integrated with respect to, ... in   this case....\u00a0...Before we proceed with some more complicated examples we should once again remind you to not get excited about the other letters in the integrals.\u00a0 If we\u2019re integrating with respect to ... or ... then all other letters in the formula that represent fixed quantities (... radius, height, length of a side, ...) are just constants and can be treated as such when doing the integral....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s do some more examples....\u00a0...For   a sphere of radius ... find the   volume of the cap of height .......\u00a0...A sketch is probably best to illustrate what we\u2019re after   here....\u00a0...We are after the top portion of the sphere and the height   of this is portion is ....\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll use a cross-sectional   area that starts at the bottom of the cap, which is at ...,   and moves up towards the top, which is at ....\u00a0 So, each cross-section will be a disk of   radius ....\u00a0 It is a little easier to see that the   radius will be ... if we look at it   from the top as shown in the sketch to the right above.\u00a0 The area of this disk is then,...\u00a0...This is a problem however as we need the cross-sectional   area in terms of ....\u00a0 So, what we really need to determine what ...\u00a0will be for any given ... at the cross-section.\u00a0 To   get this let\u2019s look at the sphere from the front....\u00a0...In particular look at the triangle ....\u00a0 Because the point ... lies on the sphere itself we can see   that the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle (the line ...) is ..., the radius of the sphere.\u00a0   The line ... has a length of ... and the line ... has length ... so by   the Pythagorean Theorem we know,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we now know   what ...\u00a0will be for any given ... and so the cross-sectional area is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

integral.\u00a0 However, unlike the previous two examples it was not multiplied times the ... or the ... and so could not be pulled out of the integral.\u00a0 In this case it was like we were integrating ...\u00a0and we know how integrate that.\u00a0 So, in this case we need to treat the ...\u00a0like the 4 and so when we integrate that we\u2019ll pick up a .......\u00a0...Find   the volume of a wedge cut out of a cylinder of radius ... if the angle between the top and bottom of the wedge is .......We should really start off with a sketch of just what   we\u2019re looking for here....On the left we see how the wedge is being cut out of the   cylinder.\u00a0 The base of the cylinder is   the circle give by ...\u00a0and the angle between this circle and the   top of the wedge is ....\u00a0 The sketch in the upper right position is   the actual wedge itself.\u00a0 Given the   orientation of the axes here we get the portion of the circle with positive ... and so we can write the equation of   the circle as ...\u00a0since we only need the positive ... values.\u00a0 Note as well that this is the reason for   the way we oriented the axes here.\u00a0 We   get positive ...\u2019s and we can write   the equation of the circle as a function only of ...\u2019s....\u00a0...Now, as we can see in the two sketches of the wedge the   cross-sectional area will be a right triangle and the area will be a function   of ... as we move from the back of   the cylinder, at ...,   to the front of the cylinder, at ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The right angle of the triangle will be on the circle   itself while the point on the ...-axis   will have an interior angle of ....\u00a0 The base of the triangle will have a length   of ... and using a little right   triangle trig we see that the height of the rectangle is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we now know   the base and height of our triangle, in terms of ..., and we have an equation for ... in terms of ... and so   we can see that the area of the triangle, ...   the cross-sectional area is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The limits on

then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The next example is very similar to the previous one except it can be a little difficult to visualize the solid itself....\u00a0...Find   the volume of the solid whose base is a disk of radius ... and whose cross-sections are equilateral triangles....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with a couple of sketches of this   solid.\u00a0 The sketch on the left is from   the \u201cfront\u201d of the solid and the sketch on the right is more from the top of   the solid.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The base of this solid is the disk of radius ... and we move from the back of the   disk at ...\u00a0to the front of the disk at ...\u00a0we form equilateral triangles to form the   solid.\u00a0 A sample equilateral triangle,   which is also the cross-sectional area, is shown above to hopefully make it a   little clearer how the solid is formed....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s get a formula for the cross-sectional   area.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the two   sketches below....\u00a0...In the left hand sketch we are looking at the solid from   directly above and notice that we \u201creoriented\u201d the sketch a little to put the   ... and ...-axis in the \u201cnormal\u201d orientation.\u00a0 The solid vertical line in this sketch is   the cross-sectional area.\u00a0 From this we   can see that the cross-section occurs at a given ... and the top half will have a length of ... where the value of ...   will be the ...-coordinate of the   point on the circle and so is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, because the cross-section is an equilateral triangle   that is centered on the ...-axis the   bottom half will also have a length of ....\u00a0 Thus the base of the cross-section must   have a length of 2.......\u00a0...The sketch to the right is of one of the   cross-sections.\u00a0 As noted above the   base of the triangle has a length of 2....\u00a0 Also note that because it is an equilateral   triangle the angles are all ....\u00a0 If we divide the cross-section in two (as   shown with the dashed line) we now have two right triangles and using right   triangle trig we can see that the length of the dashed line is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Therefore the   height of the cross-section is ....\u00a0 Because the cross-section is a triangle we   know that that it\u2019s area must then be,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we used the cross-sectional area in terms of ... because each of the cross-sections   is perpendicular to the ...-axis and   this pretty much forces us to integrate with respect to .......\u00a0...The volume of the solid is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The final example we\u2019re going to work here is a little tricky both in seeing how to set it up and in doing the integral....\u00a0...Find   the volume of a torus with radii ...   and .......\u00a0...First, just what is a torus?\u00a0 A torus is a donut shaped solid that is   generated by rotating the circle of radius ... and centered at (...,   0) about the ...-axis.\u00a0 This is shown in the sketch to the left   below....\u00a0...One of the trickiest parts of this problem is seeing what   the cross-sectional area needs to be.\u00a0   There is an obvious one.\u00a0 Most   people would probably think of using the circle of radius ... that we\u2019re rotating about the ...-axis as the cross-section.\u00a0 It is definitely one of the more obvious   choices, however setting up an integral using this is not so easy....\u00a0...So, what we\u2019ll do is use a cross-section as shown in the   sketch to the right above.\u00a0 If we cut   the torus perpendicular to the ...-axis   we\u2019ll get a cross-section of a ring and finding the area of that shouldn\u2019t be   too bad.\u00a0 To do that let\u2019s take a look   at the two sketches below....\u00a0...The sketch to the left is a sketch of the full   cross-section.\u00a0 The sketch to the right is more important however.\u00a0 This is a   sketch of the circle that we are rotating about the ...-axis.\u00a0 Included is a line   representing where the cross-sectional area would be in the torus....\u00a0...Notice that the inner radius will always be the left   portion of the circle and the outer radius will always be the right portion   of the circle.\u00a0 Now, we know that the   equation of this is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and so if we   solve for ... we can get the   equations for the left and right sides as shown above in the sketch.\u00a0 This however means that we also now have   equations for the inner and outer radii....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The   cross-sectional area is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, the   lowest cross-section will occur at  ...\u00a0and the highest cross-section will occur at ...\u00a0and so the limits for the integral will be .......\u00a0...The integral   giving the volume is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we   used the fact that because the integrand is an even function and we\u2019re   integrating over ...\u00a0we could change the lower limit to zero and   double the value of the integral.\u00a0 We   saw this fact back in the ... section....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now   reached the second really tricky part of this example.\u00a0 With the knowledge that we\u2019ve currently got   at this point this integral is not possible to do.\u00a0 It requires something called a ... and that is a   topic for Calculus II.\u00a0 Luckily enough   for us, and this is the tricky part, in this case we can actually determine   what the integrals value is using what we know about integral\u2019s....\u00a0...Just for a   second let\u2019s think about a different problem.\u00a0   Let\u2019s suppose we wanted to use an integral to determine the area under   the portion of the circle of radius ...   and centered at the origin that is in the first quadrant.\u00a0 There are a couple of ways to do this, but   to match what we\u2019re doing here let\u2019s do the following.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We know that   the equation of the circle is ...\u00a0and if we solve for ... the equation of the circle in the first (and fourth for that   matter) quadrant is,...\u00a0...If we want an integral for the area in the first quadrant   we can think of this area as the region between the curve ...\u00a0and the ...-axis   for ...\u00a0and this is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In other words,   this integral represents one quarter of the area of a circle of radius ... and from basic geometric formulas we   now know that this integral must have the value,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, putting all   this together the volume of the torus is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

fast and loose with it and because of that many students don\u2019t really understand it or how it can be important....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s address how we play fast and loose with it.\u00a0 Recall that technically when we integrate a sum or difference we are actually doing multiple integrals.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...Upon evaluating each of these integrals we should get a constant of integration for each integral since we really are doing two integrals....\u00a0...\u00a0...Since there is no reason to think that the constants of integration will be the same from each integral we use different constants for each integral....\u00a0...Now, both ... and ... are unknown constants and so the sum of two unknown constants is just an unknown constant and we acknowledge that by simply writing the sum as a .......\u00a0...So, the integral is then,...\u00a0...We also tend to play fast and loose with constants of integration in some substitution rule problems.\u00a0 Consider the following problem,...\u00a0...Technically when we integrate we should get,...\u00a0...Since the whole integral is multiplied by ..., the whole answer, including the constant of integration, should be multiplied by ....\u00a0 Upon multiplying the ...\u00a0through the answer we get,...\u00a0...However, since the constant of integration is an unknown constant dividing it by 2 isn\u2019t going to change that fact so we tend to just write the fraction as a .......\u00a0...In general, we don\u2019t really need to worry about how we\u2019ve played fast and loose with the constant of integration in either of the two examples above....\u00a0...The real problem however is that because we play fast and loose with these constants of integration most students don\u2019t really have a good grasp oF them and don\u2019t understand that there are times where the constants of integration are important and that we need to be careful with them....\u00a0...To see how a lack of understanding about the constant of integration can cause problems consider the following integral....\u00a0...This is a really simple integral.\u00a0 However, there are two ways (both simple) to integrate it and that is where the problem arises....\u00a0...The first integration method is to just break up the fraction and do the integral....\u00a0...The second way is to use the following substitution....\u00a0...Can you see the problem?\u00a0 We integrated the same function and got very different answers.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0 Integrating the same function should give us the same answer.\u00a0 We only used different methods to do the integral and both are perfectly legitimate integration methods.\u00a0 So, how can using different methods produce different answer?...\u00a0...The first thing that we should notice is that because we used a different method for each there is no reason to think that the constant of integration will in fact be the same number and so we really should use different letters for each.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...More appropriate answers would be,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take another look at the second answer.\u00a0 Using a property of logarithms we can write the answer to the second integral as follows,...\u00a0...Upon doing this we can see that the answers really aren\u2019t that different after all.\u00a0 In fact they only differ by a constant and we can even find a relationship between ... and ....\u00a0 It looks like,...\u00a0...So, without a proper understanding of the constant of integration, in particular using different integration techniques on the same integral will likely produce a different constant of integration, we might never figure out why we got \u201cdifferent\u201d answers for the integral....\u00a0...Note as well that getting answers that differ by a constant doesn\u2019t violate any principles of calculus.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve actually seen a fact that suggested that this might happen.\u00a0 We saw a fact in the ... section that said that if ...\u00a0then ....\u00a0 In other words, if two functions have the same derivative then they can differ by no more than a constant....\u00a0...This is exactly what we\u2019ve got here.\u00a0 The two functions,...have exactly the same derivative,...and as we\u2019ve shown they really only differ by a constant....\u00a0...There is another integral that also exhibits this behavior.\u00a0 Consider,...\u00a0...There are actually three different methods for doing this integral....\u00a0...This method uses a trig formula,...Using this formula (and a quick substitution) the integral becomes,...\u00a0...This method uses the substitution,...\u00a0...Here is another substitution that could be done here as well....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got three different answers each with a different constant of integration.\u00a0 However, according to the fact above these three answers should only differ by a constant since they all have the same derivative....\u00a0...In fact they do only differ by a constant.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need the following trig formulas to prove this....\u00a0...Start with the answer from the first method and use the double angle formula above....\u00a0...Now, from the second identity above we have,...so, plug this in,...This is then answer we got from the second method with a slightly different constant.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...We can do a similar manipulation to get the answer from the third method.\u00a0 Again, starting with the answer from the first method use the double angle formula and then substitute in for the cosine instead of the sine using,...\u00a0...Doing this gives,...which is the answer from the third method with a different constant and again we can relate the two constants by,...\u00a0...So, what have we learned here?\u00a0 Hopefully we\u2019ve seen that constants of integration are important and we can\u2019t forget about them.\u00a0 We often don\u2019t work with them in a Calculus I course, yet without a good understanding of them we would be hard pressed to understand how different integration methods and apparently

...\u00a0...Recall as well that we are assuming ...\u00a0and so ....\u00a0 If we now multiply ...   by ...\u00a0(which is positive and so the inequality   stays the same) we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Next, add ...\u00a0to both sides of this to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...However, by ...,   the right side of this is nothing more than ...\u00a0and so we have,...\u00a0...but this is exactly what we wanted to show....\u00a0...So, provided ...\u00a0the tangent line is in fact below the graph   of .......\u00a0...We now need to assume ....\u00a0 Using the Mean Value Theorem on ...\u00a0means there is a number ... such that ...\u00a0and,...\u00a0...\u00a0...If we multiply both sides of this by ...1   and then adding ...\u00a0to both sides and we again arise at ....   ...\u00a0...Now, from the Mean Value Theorem we know that ...\u00a0and because ...\u00a0for every ... on ... we know that the   derivative is still increasing and so we have,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now multiply this by ...,   which is now a negative number since ....\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that we had to switch the direction of the   inequality since we were multiplying by a negative number.\u00a0 If we now add ...\u00a0to both sides of this and then substitute ...   into the results we arrive at,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, again we\u2019ve shown that the tangent line is always   below the graph of ....   ...\u00a0...We\u2019ve now shown that if ... is any number in ...,   with ...\u00a0the tangent lines are always below the graph   of ...\u00a0on ...   and so ...\u00a0is concave up on .... ...\u00a0...\u00a0...This proof is nearly identical to the proof of 1 and since   that proof is fairly long we\u2019re going to just get things started and then   leave the rest of it to you to go through....\u00a0...Let ... be any   number in ... .\u00a0 To show that ...\u00a0is concave down we need to show that for any   ... in ..., ...,   that the tangent line is always above the graph of ...\u00a0or,\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...From this point on the proof is almost identical to the   proof of 1 except that you\u2019ll need to use the fact that the derivative in   this case is decreasing since ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave it to you to fill in the   details of this proof....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point of ...\u00a0such that ...\u00a0and that ...\u00a0is continuous in a region around ....\u00a0 Then,...\u00a0...The proof of this fact uses the ... which, if you\u2019re following along in my notes has actually not been covered yet.\u00a0 The Mean Value Theorem can be covered at any time and for whatever the reason I decided to put it after the section this fact is in.\u00a0 Before reading through the proof of this fact you should take a quick look at the Mean Value Theorem section.\u00a0 You really just need the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem for this proof however....\u00a0...First since we are assuming that ...\u00a0is continuous in a region around ...\u00a0then we can assume that in fact\u00a0 ...\u00a0is also true in some open region, say ...\u00a0around ...,   ... .......\u00a0...Now let ... be any   number such that ...,   we\u2019re going to use the Mean Value Theorem on ....\u00a0 However, instead of using it on the   function itself we\u2019re going to use it on the first derivative.\u00a0 So, the Mean Value Theorem tells us that   there is a number ...\u00a0such that, ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, because ...\u00a0we know that ...\u00a0and we also know that ...\u00a0so we then get that,...\u00a0...However, we also assumed that ...\u00a0and so we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Or, in other   words to the left of ...\u00a0the function is increasing....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now turn things around and let ... be any number such that ...\u00a0and use the Mean Value Theorem on ...\u00a0and the first derivative.\u00a0 The Mean Value Theorem tells us that there   is a number ...\u00a0such that, ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, because ...\u00a0we know that ...\u00a0and we also know that ...\u00a0so we then get that,...\u00a0...Again use the fact that we also assumed that ...\u00a0to get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We now know   that to the right of ...\u00a0the function is decreasing....\u00a0...So, to the left of ...\u00a0the function is increasing and to the right   of ...\u00a0the function is decreasing so by the first   derivative test this means that ...\u00a0must be a relative maximum....\u00a0...\u00a0...This proof is nearly identical to the proof of 1 and since   that proof is somewhat long we\u2019re going to leave the proof to you to do.\u00a0 In this case the only difference is that   now we are going to assume that ...\u00a0and that will give us the opposite signs of   the first derivative on either side of ...\u00a0which gives us the conclusion we were   after.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave it to you to fill   in all the details of this....\u00a0...\u00a0...There isn\u2019t really anything to prove here.\u00a0 All this statement says is that any of the   three cases are possible and to \u201cprove\u201d this all one needs to do is provide   an example of each of the three cases.\u00a0   This was done in ... section where this test was presented so we\u2019ll leave it to you to   go back to that section to see those graphs to verify that all three   possibilities really can happen....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Suppose ...\u00a0is a function that satisfies all of the   following....\u00a0...Then there is a number ...   such that ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Or, in other words ...\u00a0has a critical point in (...)....\u00a0...We\u2019ll need to do this with 3 cases....\u00a0...\u00a0on [...,...] where ... is a constant....In this case ...\u00a0for all ...   in [...,...] and so we can take ...   to be any number in [...,...]....\u00a0...There   is some number ... in (...) such that .......Because ...\u00a0is continuous on [...,...] by the ... we know that ...\u00a0will have a maximum somewhere in [...,...].\u00a0 Also, because ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we know that in fact the maximum value will   have to occur at some ... that is in   the open interval (...), or ....\u00a0 Because ...   occurs in the interior of the interval this means that ...\u00a0will actually have a relative maximum at ...\u00a0and by the second hypothesis above we also   know that ...\u00a0exists.\u00a0   Finally, by ... we then   know that in fact ...\u00a0must be a critical point and because we know   that\u00a0 ...\u00a0exists we must have ...\u00a0(as opposed to ...\u00a0not existing\u2026)....\u00a0...There   is some number ... in (...) such that .......This is nearly identical to Case 2 so we won\u2019t put in   quite as much detail.\u00a0 By the Extreme   Value Theorem ...\u00a0will have minimum in [...,...] and because ...\u00a0\u00a0and ...\u00a0we know that the minimum must occur at ...\u00a0where ....\u00a0 Finally, by Fermat\u2019s Theorem we know that .......\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Suppose ...\u00a0is a function that satisfies both of the   following....\u00a0...Then there is a number ...   such that ... and...Or,...\u00a0...For illustration purposes let\u2019s suppose that the graph of ...\u00a0is,...\u00a0...Note of course that it may not look like this, but we just   need a quick sketch to make it easier to see what we\u2019re talking about here....\u00a0...The first thing that we need is the equation of the secant   line that goes through the two points ...   and ... as shown above.\u00a0 This is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now   define a new function, ...,   as to be the difference between ...\u00a0and the equation of the secant line or,...\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s notice that because ...\u00a0is the sum of ...,   which is assumed to be continuous on [...],   and a linear polynomial, which we know to be continuous everywhere, we know   that ...\u00a0must also be continuous on [...]....\u00a0...Also, we can see that ...\u00a0must be differentiable on (...) because it is the sum of ...,   which is assumed to be differentiable on (...),   and a linear polynomial, which we know to be differentiable.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We could also have just computed the derivative as   follows,...at which point we can see that it exists on (...) because we assumed that ...\u00a0exists on (...) and the last term is just a constant....\u00a0...Finally, we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In other words,   ...\u00a0satisfies the three

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we will start looking at the volume of a solid of revolution.\u00a0 We should first define just what a solid of revolution is. \u00a0To get a solid of revolution we start out with a function, ..., on an interval [...]....We then rotate this curve about a given axis to get the surface of the solid of revolution.\u00a0 For purposes of this discussion let\u2019s rotate the curve about the ...-axis, although it could be any vertical or horizontal axis.\u00a0 Doing this for the curve above gives the following three dimensional region....What we want to do over the course of the next two sections is to determine the volume of this object.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the final the ... section of the Extras chapter we derived the following formulas for the volume of this solid....\u00a0...\u00a0...where, ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is the cross-sectional area of the solid.\u00a0 There are many ways to get the cross-sectional area and we\u2019ll see two (or three depending on how you look at it) over the next two sections.\u00a0 Whether we will use ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0will depend upon the method and the axis of rotation used for each problem....\u00a0...One of the easier methods for getting the cross-sectional area is to cut the object perpendicular to the axis of rotation.\u00a0 Doing this the cross section will be either a solid disk if the object is solid (as our above example is) or a ring if we\u2019ve hollowed out a portion of the solid (we will see this eventually)....\u00a0...In the case that we get a solid disk the area is,...where the radius will depend upon the function and the axis of rotation. ...\u00a0...In the case that we get a ring the area is,...\u00a0...where again both of the radii will depend on the functions given and the axis of rotation.\u00a0 Note as well that in the case of a solid disk we can think of the inner radius as zero and we\u2019ll arrive at the correct formula for a solid disk and so this is a much more general formula to use....\u00a0...Also, in both cases, whether the area is a function of ... or a function of ... will depend upon the axis of rotation as we will see....\u00a0...This method is often called the ... or the .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s do an example....\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by ...,   ...,   ...,   and the ...-axis about the ...-axis....\u00a0...The first thing to do is get a sketch of the bounding   region and the solid obtained by rotating the region about the ...-axis.\u00a0 Here are both of these sketches....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, to get a cross section we cut the solid at any ....\u00a0   Below are a couple of sketches showing a typical cross section.\u00a0 The sketch on the right shows a cut away of   the object with a typical cross section without the caps.\u00a0 The sketch on the left shows just the curve   we\u2019re rotating as well as its mirror image along the bottom of the solid. ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...In this case the radius is simply the distance from the ...-axis to the curve and this is   nothing more than the function value at that particular ... as shown above.\u00a0 The   cross-sectional area is then,...\u00a0...Next we need to determine the limits of integration.\u00a0 Working from left to right the first cross   section will occur at ...\u00a0and the last cross section will occur at ....\u00a0 These are the limits of integration....\u00a0...The volume of this solid is then,...\u00a0...In the above example the object was a solid object, but the more interesting objects are those that are not solid so let\u2019s take a look at one of those....\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the portion of the region   bounded by ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0that lies in the first quadrant about the ...-axis....First, let\u2019s get a graph of the bounding region and a   graph of the object.\u00a0 Remember that we   only want the portion of the bounding region that lies in the first   quadrant.\u00a0 There is a portion of the   bounding region that is in the third quadrant as well, but we don't want that   for this problem....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are a couple of things to note with this   problem.\u00a0 First, we are only looking   for the volume of the \u201cwalls\u201d of this solid, not the complete interior as we   did in the last example.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, we will get our cross section by cutting the object   perpendicular to the axis of rotation.\u00a0   The cross section will be a ring (remember we are only looking at the   walls) for this example and it will be horizontal at some ....\u00a0   This means that the inner and outer radius for the ring will be ... values and so we will need to   rewrite our functions into the form ....\u00a0 Here are the functions written in the   correct form for this example....\u00a0...Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the   walls of this object as well as a typical ring.\u00a0 The sketch on the left includes the back   portion of the object to give a little context to the figure on the right....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The inner radius in this case is the distance from the ...-axis to the inner curve while the   outer radius is the distance from the ...-axis   to the outer curve.\u00a0 Both of these are   then ... distances and so are given   by the equations of the curves as shown above....\u00a0...The cross-sectional area is then,...\u00a0...Working from the bottom of the solid to the top we can see   that the first cross-section will occur at ...\u00a0and the last cross-section will occur at ....\u00a0 These will be the limits of   integration.\u00a0 The volume is then,...\u00a0...With these two examples out of the way we can now make a generalization about this method.\u00a0 If we rotate about a horizontal axis (the ...-axis for example) then the cross sectional area will be a function of ....\u00a0 Likewise, if we rotate about a vertical axis (the ...-axis for example) then the cross sectional area will be a function of .......\u00a0...The remaining two examples in this section will make sure that we don\u2019t get too used to the idea of always rotating about the ... or ...-axis.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0about the line .......\u00a0...First let\u2019s get the bounding region and the solid graphed....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Again, we are going to be looking for the volume of the   walls of this object.\u00a0 Also since we   are rotating about a horizontal axis we know that the cross-sectional area   will be a function of .......\u00a0...Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the   walls of this object as well as a typical ring.\u00a0 The sketch on the left includes the back   portion of the object to give a little context to the figure on the right....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we\u2019re going to have to be careful here in determining   the inner and outer radius as they aren\u2019t going to be quite as simple they   were in the previous two examples. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the inner radius as this one is a little   clearer.\u00a0 First, the inner radius is   NOT ....\u00a0 The distance from the ...-axis to the inner edge of the ring is ..., but we want the radius and that is the distance from the axis   of rotation to the inner edge of the ring.\u00a0   So, we know that the distance from the axis of rotation to the ...-axis is 4 and the distance from the ...-axis to the inner ring is ....\u00a0   The inner radius must then be the difference between these two.\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...The outer radius works the same way.\u00a0 The outer radius is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that given the location of the typical ring in the sketch above the formula for the outer radius may not look quite right but it is in fact correct.\u00a0 As sketched the   outer edge of the ring is below the ...-axis and   at this point the value of the function will be negative and so when we do   the subtraction in the formula for the outer radius we\u2019ll actually be   subtracting off a negative number which has the net effect of adding this   distance onto 4 and that gives the correct

correct radius in this case....\u00a0...The cross-sectional area for this case is,...\u00a0...The first ring will occur at ...\u00a0and the last ring will occur at ...\u00a0and so these are our limits of   integration.\u00a0 The volume is then,...\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by ...and ...\u00a0about the line .......\u00a0...As with the

vertical axis and so the cross-sectional area will be a function of ....\u00a0   This also means that we are going to have to rewrite the functions to   also get them in terms of .......\u00a0...Here are a couple of sketches of the boundaries of the   walls of this object as well as a typical ring.\u00a0 The sketch on the left includes the back   portion of the object to give a little context to the figure on the right....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The inner and outer radius for this case is both similar   and different from the previous example.\u00a0   This example is similar in the sense that the radii are not just the   functions.\u00a0 In this example the functions   are the distances from the ...-axis   to the edges of the rings.\u00a0 The center   of the ring however is a distance of 1 from the ...-axis.\u00a0 This means that   the distance from the center to the edges is a distance from the axis of   rotation to the ...-axis (a distance   of 1) and then from the ...-axis to   the edge of the rings.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the radii are then the functions plus 1 and that is   what makes this example different from the previous example.\u00a0 Here we had to add the distance to the   function value whereas in the previous example we needed to subtract the function   from this distance.\u00a0 Note that without   sketches the radii on these problems can be difficult to get....\u00a0...So, in summary, we\u2019ve got the following for the inner and   outer radius for this example....\u00a0...\u00a0...The cross-sectional area is then,...\u00a0...The

get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Also note that since we know that ...\u00a0we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Converting points from Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates into spherical coordinates is usually done with the same conversion formulas.\u00a0 To see how this is done let\u2019s work an example of each....\u00a0...Perform   each of the following conversions....Convert   the point ...\u00a0from

or ....\u00a0 We will use the   conversion for ... in this case....\u00a0...Now, we actually have more possible choices for ...\u00a0but all of them will reduce down to one of   the two angles above since they will just be one of these two angles with one   or more complete rotations around the unit circle added on.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will however, need to decide which one is the correct   angle since only one will be.\u00a0\u00a0 To do   this let\u2019s notice that, in two dimensions, the point with coordinates ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0lies in the second quadrant.\u00a0 This means that

then .......\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at some equations and identify the surfaces that they represent....\u00a0...Identify   the surface for each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are a couple of ways to think about this one.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, think about what this equation is saying.\u00a0 This equation says that, no matter what ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are, the distance from the origin must be   5.\u00a0 So, we can rotate as much as we   want away from the ...-axis and   around the ...-axis, but we must   always remain at a fixed distance from the origin.\u00a0 This is exactly what a sphere is.\u00a0 So, this is a sphere of radius 5 centered   at the origin....\u00a0...The other way to think about it is to just convert to   Cartesian coordinates....\u00a0...Sure enough a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case there isn\u2019t an easy way to convert to   Cartesian coordinates so we\u2019ll just need to think about this one a   little.\u00a0 This equation says that no   matter how far away from the origin that we move and no matter how much we   rotate around the ...-axis the point   must always be at an angle of ...\u00a0from the ...-axis....\u00a0...This is exactly what happens in a cone.\u00a0 All of the points on a cone are a fixed   angle from the ...-axis.\u00a0 So, we have a cone whose points are all at   an angle of ...\u00a0from the ...-axis....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...As with the last part we won\u2019t be able to easily convert   to Cartesian coordinates here.\u00a0 In this   case no matter how far from the origin we get or how much we rotate down from   the positive ...-axis the points must   always form an angle of ...\u00a0with the ...-axis....\u00a0...Points in a vertical plane will do this.\u00a0 So, we have a vertical plane that forms an   angle of ...\u00a0with the positive ...-axis....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...\u00a0In this case we can   convert to Cartesian coordinates so let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 There are actually two ways to do this   conversion.\u00a0 We will look at both since   both will be used on occasion....\u00a0...In this solution method we will convert directly to   Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0 To do this we   will first need to square both sides of the equation....\u00a0...Now, for no apparent reason add ...\u00a0to both sides....\u00a0...Now we can convert to Cartesian coordinates....\u00a0...So, we have a cylinder of radius 2 centered on the ...-axis.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This solution method wasn\u2019t too bad, but it did require   some not so obvious steps to complete....\u00a0...This method is much shorter, but also involves something   that you may not see the first time around.\u00a0   In this case instead of going straight to Cartesian coordinates we\u2019ll   first convert to cylindrical coordinates....\u00a0...This won\u2019t always work, but in this case all we need to do   is recognize that ...\u00a0and we will get something we can   recognize.\u00a0 Using this we get,...\u00a0...At this point we know this is a cylinder (remember that   we\u2019re in three dimensions and so this isn\u2019t a circle!).\u00a0 However, let\u2019s go ahead and finish the   conversion process out....\u00a0...So, as we saw in the last part of the previous example it will ... be easier to convert equations in spherical coordinates into cylindrical coordinates before converting into Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0 This won\u2019t always be easier, but it can make some of the conversions quicker and easier....\u00a0...The last thing that we want to do in this section is generalize the first three parts of the previous example....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/SphericalCoords.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls

plane that contains the points ...,   ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...In order to write down the equation of plane we need a   point (we\u2019ve got three so we\u2019re cool there) and a normal vector.\u00a0 We need to find a normal vector.\u00a0 Recall however, that we saw how to do this   in the ...   section....\u00a0...We can form the following two vectors from the given   points....These two vectors will lie completely in the plane since   we formed them from points that were in the plane.\u00a0 Notice as well that there are many possible   vectors to use here, we just chose two of the possibilities....\u00a0...Now, we know that the cross product of two vectors will be   orthogonal to both of these vectors.\u00a0   Since both of these are in the plane any vector that is orthogonal to   both of these will also be orthogonal to the plane.\u00a0 Therefore, we can use the cross product as   the normal vector....\u00a0...The equation of the plane is then,...\u00a0...We used ... for   the point, but could have used any of the three points....\u00a0...Determine   if the plane given by ...\u00a0and the line given by ...\u00a0are orthogonal, parallel

vector that is parallel   to the line.\u00a0 This is .......\u00a0...Now, if these two vectors are parallel then the line and   the plane will be orthogonal.\u00a0 If you   think about it this makes some sense.\u00a0   If ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are parallel, then ...\u00a0is orthogonal to the plane, but ...\u00a0is also parallel to the line.\u00a0 So, if the two vectors are parallel the   line and plane will be orthogonal....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check this....\u00a0...So, the vectors aren\u2019t parallel and so the plane and the   line are not orthogonal....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s check to see if the plane and line are   parallel.\u00a0 If the line is parallel to   the plane then any vector parallel to the line will be orthogonal to the   normal vector of the plane.\u00a0 In other   words, if ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are orthogonal then the line and the plane   will be parallel....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check this....\u00a0...The two vectors aren\u2019t orthogonal and so the line and   plane

In that section we talked about them because we wrote down the equation of a line in ...\u00a0in terms of a ... (sometimes called a ...).\u00a0 In this section we want to look a little closer at them and we also want to look at some vector functions in ...other than lines....\u00a0...A vector function is a function that takes one or more variables and returns a vector.\u00a0 We\u2019ll spend most of this section looking at vector functions of a single variable as most of the places where vector functions show up here will be vector functions of single variables.\u00a0 We will however briefly look at vector functions of two variables at the end of this section....\u00a0...A vector functions of a single variable in ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0have the form,...respectively, where ..., ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are called the .......\u00a0...The main idea that we want to discuss in this section is that of graphing and identifying the graph given by a vector function.\u00a0 Before we do that however, we should talk briefly about the domain of a vector function.\u00a0 The ... of a vector function is the set of all ...\u2019s for which all the component functions are defined....\u00a0...Determine   the domain of the following function....The first component is defined for all ...\u2019s.\u00a0   The second component is only defined for ....\u00a0 The third component is only defined for ....\u00a0 Putting all of these together gives the   following domain....This is the largest possible interval for which all three   components are defined....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now move into looking at the graph of vector functions.\u00a0 In order to graph a vector function all we do is think of the vector returned by the vector function as a position vector for points on the graph.\u00a0 Recall that a position vector, say ..., is a vector that starts at the origin and ends at the point ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in order to sketch the graph of a vector function all we need to do is plug in some values of ... and then plot points that correspond to the resulting position vector we get out of the vector function....\u00a0...Because it is a little easier to visualize things we\u2019ll start off by looking at graphs of vector functions in ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of each of the following vector functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Okay, the first thing that we need to do is plug in a few   values of ... and get some position   vectors.\u00a0 Here are a few,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, what this tells us is that the following points are   all on the graph of this vector function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a   sketch of this vector function....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this sketch   we\u2019ve included many more evaluations that just those above.\u00a0 Also note that we\u2019ve put in the position   vectors (in gray and dashed) so you can see how all this is working.\u00a0 Note however, that in practice the position   vectors are generally not included in the sketch....\u00a0...In this case it   looks like we\u2019ve got the graph of the line .......\u00a0... ...Here are a couple of evaluations for this vector function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got a   few points on the graph of this function.\u00a0   However, unlike the first part this isn\u2019t really going to be enough   points to get a good idea of this graph.\u00a0   In general, it can take quite a few function evaluations to get an   idea of what the graph is and it\u2019s usually easier to use a computer to do the   graphing....\u00a0...Here is a   sketch of this graph.\u00a0 We\u2019ve put in a   few vectors/evaluations to illustrate them, but the reality is that we did   have to use a computer to get a good sketch here....\u00a0...Both of the vector functions in the above example were in the form,...and what we were really sketching is the graph of ...\u00a0as you probably caught onto.\u00a0 Let\u2019s graph a couple of other vector functions that do not fall into this pattern.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of each of the following vector functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...As we saw in the last part of the previous example it can   really take quite a few function evaluations to really be able to sketch the   graph of a vector function.\u00a0 Because of   that we\u2019ll be skipping all the function evaluations here and just giving the   graph.\u00a0 The main point behind this set   of examples is to not get you too locked into the form we were looking at   above.\u00a0 The first part will also lead   to an important idea that we\u2019ll discuss after this example....\u00a0...So, with that said here are the sketches of each of these....\u00a0... ...So, in this case it looks like we\u2019ve got an ellipse....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the sketch for this vector function....\u00a0...Before we move on to vector functions in ...\u00a0let\u2019s go back and take a quick look at the first vector function we sketched in the previous example, ....\u00a0 The fact that we got an ellipse here should not come as a surprise to you.\u00a0 We know that the first component function gives the ... coordinate and the second component function gives the ... coordinates of the point that we graph.\u00a0 If we strip these out to make this clear we get,...\u00a0...This should look familiar to you.\u00a0 Back when we were looking at ... we saw that this was nothing more than one of the sets of parametric equations that gave an ellipse....\u00a0...This is an important idea in the study of vector functions.\u00a0 Any vector function can be broken down into a set of parametric equations that represent the same graph.\u00a0 In general, the two dimensional vector function, ..., can be broken down into the parametric equations,...\u00a0...\u00a0 Likewise, a three dimensional vector function, ..., can be broken down into the parametric equations,...\u00a0...Do not get too excited about the fact that we\u2019re now looking at parametric equations in ....\u00a0 They work in exactly the same manner as parametric equations in ...\u00a0which we\u2019re used to dealing with already.\u00a0 The only difference is that we now have a third component....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of graphs of vector functions....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following vector function....\u00a0...Notice that this is nothing more than a line.\u00a0 It might help if we rewrite it a little....\u00a0...In this form we can see that this is the equation of a   line that goes through the point ...\u00a0and is parallel to the vector .......\u00a0...To graph this line all that we need to do is plot the   point and then sketch in the parallel vector.\u00a0   In order to get the sketch will assume that the vector is on the line   and will start at the point in the line.\u00a0   To sketch in the line all we do this is extend the parallel vector   into a line....\u00a0...Here is a sketch....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following vector function....\u00a0...In this case to see what we\u2019ve got for a graph let\u2019s get   the parametric equations for the curve....\u00a0...If we ignore the ...   equation for a bit we\u2019ll ...   (hopefully) that the parametric equations for ... and ... give a circle   of radius 2 centered on the origin (or about the ...-axis since we are in ...)....\u00a0...Now, all the parametric equations here tell us is that no   matter what is going on in the graph all the ... coordinates must be 3.\u00a0   So, we get a circle of radius 2 centered on the ...-axis and at the level of .......\u00a0...Here is a sketch....\u00a0...Note that it is very easy to modify the above vector function to get a circle centered on the ... or ...-axis as well.\u00a0 For instance,...will be a circle of radius 10 centered on the ...-axis and at ....\u00a0 In other words, as long as two of the terms are a sine and a cosine (with the same coefficient) and the other is a fixed number then we will have a circle that is centered on the axis that is given by the fixed number....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a modification of this....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following vector function....\u00a0...If this one had a constant in the ... component we would have another circle.\u00a0 However, in this case we don\u2019t have a   constant.\u00a0 Instead we\u2019ve got a ... and that will change the curve.\u00a0 However, because the ... and ... component   functions are still a circle in parametric equations our curve should have a   circular nature to it in some way....\u00a0...In fact, the only change is in the ... component and as ...   increases the ... coordinate will   increase.\u00a0 Also, as ... increases the ... and ... coordinates   will continue to form a circle centered on the ...-axis.\u00a0 Putting these two   ideas together tells us that at we increase ... the circle that is being traced out in the ... and ... directions   should be also be rising....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of this curve....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got a helix (or spiral, depending on what you   want to call it) here....\u00a0...As with circles the component that has the ... will determine the axis that the helix rotates about.\u00a0 For instance,...is a helix that rotates around the ...-axis....\u00a0...Also note that if we allow the coefficients on the sine and cosine for both the circle and helix to be different we will get ellipses....\u00a0...For example,...will be a helix that rotates about the ...-axis and is in the shape of an ellipse....\u00a0...There is a nice formula that we should derive before moving onto vector functions of two variables....\u00a0...Determine   the vector equation for the line segment starting at the point\u00a0 ...\u00a0and ending at the point .......\u00a0...It is important to note here that we only want the   equation of the line segment that starts at ... and ends at ....\u00a0 We don\u2019t want any other portion of the line   and we do want the direction of the line segment preserved as we increase ....\u00a0   With all that said, let\u2019s not worry about that and just find the   vector equation of the line that passes through the two points.\u00a0 Once we have this we will be able to get   what we\u2019re after....\u00a0...So, we need a point on the line.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got two and we will use ....\u00a0   We need a vector that is parallel to the line and since we\u2019ve got two   points we can find the vector between them.\u00a0   This vector will lie on the line and hence be parallel to the   line.\u00a0 Also, let\u2019s remember that we   want to preserve the starting and ending point of the line segment so let\u2019s   construct the vector using the same \u201corientation\u201d....\u00a0...\u00a0...Using this vector and the point ... we get the following vector equation of the line....\u00a0...\u00a0...While this is the vector equation of the line, let\u2019s   rewrite the equation slightly....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is the equation of the line that contains the points ... and ....\u00a0 We of course just want   the line segment that starts at ...   and ends at ....\u00a0 We can get this by simply restricting the   values of .......\u00a0...Notice that ...\u00a0...So, if we restrict ...   to be between zero and one we will cover the line segment and we will start   and end at the correct point....\u00a0...So the vector equation of the line segment that starts at ...\u00a0and ends at ...\u00a0is,...\u00a0...As noted briefly at the beginning of this section we can also have vector functions of two variables.\u00a0 In these cases the graphs of vector function of two variables are surfaces.\u00a0 So, to make sure that we don\u2019t forget that let\u2019s work an example with that as well....\u00a0...Identify   the surface that is described by .......\u00a0...First, notice that in this case the vector function will   in fact be a function of two variables.\u00a0   This will always be the case when we are using vector functions to   represent surfaces....\u00a0...To identify the surface let\u2019s go back to parametric   equations....\u00a0...The first two are really only acknowledging that we are   picking ... and ... for free and then determining ... from our choices of these two.\u00a0   The last equation is the one that we want.\u00a0 We should recognize that function from the   section on ....\u00a0 The third equation is the equation of an   elliptic paraboloid and so the vector function represents an elliptic   paraboloid....\u00a0...As a final topic for this section let\u2019s generalize the idea from the previous example and note that given any function of one variable ( ...\u00a0or ...) or any function of two variables ( ..., ..., or ...) we can always write down a vector form of the equation....\u00a0...For a function of one variable this will be,...and for a function of two variables the vector form will be,...depending upon the original form of the function....\u00a0...For example the hyperbolic paraboloid ...\u00a0can be written as the following vector function....\u00a0...This is a fairly important idea and we will be doing quite a bit of this kind of thing in Calculus III.", "url":

coordinate planes so make sure that you can....\u00a0...Also, the point ... is often referred to as the projection of ... in the ...-plane.\u00a0 Likewise, ... is the projection of ... in the

everything we know about ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and assuming that it will work the same way.\u00a0 A good example of this is in graphing to some extent.\u00a0 Consider the following example....\u00a0...Graph   ...\u00a0in ...,   ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...In ...\u00a0we have a single coordinate system and so ...\u00a0is a point in a 1-D coordinate system....\u00a0...In

styles.\u00a0 On the left we\u2019ve   got the traditional axis system and we\u2019re used to seeing and on the right   we\u2019ve put the graph in a box.\u00a0 Both   views can be convenient on

is a line with slope 2 and a ... intercept of -3....\u00a0...However, in ...this is not necessarily a line.\u00a0 Because we have not specified a value of ... we are forced to let ... take any value.\u00a0 This means that at any particular value of ... we will get a copy of this   line.\u00a0 So, the graph is then a vertical   plane that lies over the line given by ...\u00a0in the

look at one more example of the difference between graphs in the different coordinate systems....\u00a0...Graph   ...\u00a0in ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...As with the previous example this won\u2019t have a 1-D graph   since there are two variables....\u00a0...In ...\u00a0this is a circle centered at the origin with   radius 2....\u00a0...In ...\u00a0however, as with the previous example, this   may or may not be a circle.\u00a0 Since we   have not specified ... in any way we   must assume that ... can take on any   value.\u00a0 In other words, at any value of   ... this equation must be satisfied   and so at any value ... we have a   circle of radius 2 centered on the ...axis.\u00a0 This means that we have a cylinder of   radius 2 centered on the ...-axis....\u00a0...Here are the graphs for this example....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0...Notice that again, if we look to where the cylinder   intersects the ...-plane we will   again get the circle from ...   .......\u00a0...We need to be careful with the last two examples.\u00a0 It would be tempting to take the results of these and say that we can\u2019t graph lines or circles in ...\u00a0and yet that doesn\u2019t really make sense.\u00a0 There is no reason for there to not be graphs of lines or circles in ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s think about the example of the circle.\u00a0 To graph a circle in ...\u00a0we would need to do something like ...\u00a0at ....\u00a0 This would be a circle of radius 2 centered on the ...-axis at the level of ....\u00a0 So, as long as we specify a ... we will get a circle and not a cylinder. We will see an easier way to specify circles in a later section....\u00a0...We could do the same thing with the line from the second example.\u00a0 However, we will be looking at lines in more generality in the next section and so we\u2019ll see a better way to deal with lines in ...\u00a0there....\u00a0...The point of the examples in this section is to make sure that we are being careful with graphing equations and making sure that we always remember which coordinate system that we are in....\u00a0...Another quick point to make here is that, as we\u2019ve seen in the above examples, many graphs of equations in ...\u00a0are surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t graph curves in ....\u00a0 We can and will graph curves in\u00a0 ...\u00a0as well as we\u2019ll see later in this chapter.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/3DCoords.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus II - The 3-D Coordinate Systems", "subject": "math"}},

And here is   the computation for this one....\u00a0...Notice that switching the order of the vectors in the cross product simply changed all the signs in the result.\u00a0 Note as well that this means that the two cross products will point in exactly opposite directions since they only differ by a sign.\u00a0 We\u2019ll formalize up this fact shortly when we list several facts....\u00a0...There is also a geometric interpretation of the cross product.\u00a0 First we will let ...\u00a0\u00a0be the angle between the two vectors ...\u00a0and ...and assume that ..., then we have the following fact,...and the following figure....\u00a0...There should be a natural question at this point.\u00a0 How did we know that the cross product pointed in the direction that we\u2019ve given it here?\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, as this figure, implies the cross product is orthogonal to both of the original vectors.\u00a0 This will always be the case with one exception that we\u2019ll get to in a second....\u00a0...Second, we knew that it pointed in the upward direction (in this case) by the \u201cright hand rule\u201d.\u00a0 This says that if we take our right hand, start at ...\u00a0and rotate our fingers towards ...our thumb will point in the direction of the cross product.\u00a0 Therefore, if we\u2019d sketched in ...\u00a0above we would have gotten a vector in the downward direction....\u00a0...A   plane is defined by any three points that are in the plane.\u00a0 If a plane contains the points ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0find a vector that is orthogonal to the   plane....\u00a0...The one way that we know to get an orthogonal vector is to   take a cross product.\u00a0 So, if we could   find two vectors that we knew were in the plane and took the cross product   of these two vectors we know that the cross product would be orthogonal to   both the vectors.\u00a0 However, since both   the vectors are in the plane the cross product would then also be orthogonal   to the plane....\u00a0...So, we need two vectors that are in the plane.\u00a0 This is where the points come into the   problem. Since all three points lie in the plane any vector between them must   also be in the plane.\u00a0 There are many   ways to get two vectors between these points.\u00a0   We will use the following two,...\u00a0...The cross product of these two vectors will be orthogonal   to the plane.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s find the cross   product....\u00a0...So, the vector ...\u00a0will be orthogonal to the plane containing   the three points....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s address the one time where the cross product will not be orthogonal to the original vectors.\u00a0 If the two vectors, ...\u00a0and ..., are parallel then the angle between them is either 0 or 180 degrees.\u00a0 From ... this implies that,...\u00a0...From a fact about the magnitude we saw in the first section we know that this implies...In other words, it won\u2019t be orthogonal to the original vectors since we have the zero vector.\u00a0 This does give us another test for parallel vectors however....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will be parallel vectors....\u00a0...Let\u2019s also formalize up the fact about the cross product being orthogonal to the original vectors....\u00a0...Provided ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is orthogonal to both ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Here are some nice properties about the cross product....\u00a0...If ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are vectors and ... is a number then,...\u00a0...The determinant in the last fact is computed in the same way that the cross product is computed.\u00a0 We will see an example of this computation shortly....\u00a0...There are a couple of geometric applications to the cross product as well.\u00a0 Suppose we have three vectors ..., ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and we form the three dimensional figure shown below....\u00a0...The area of the parallelogram (two dimensional front of this object) is given by,...\u00a0...\u00a0...and the volume of the parallelepiped (the whole three dimensional object) is given by,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that the absolute value bars are required since the quantity could be negative and volume isn\u2019t negative....\u00a0...We can use this volume fact to determine if three vectors lie in the same plane or not.\u00a0 If three vectors lie in the same plane then the volume of the parallelepiped will be zero....\u00a0...Determine   if the three vectors ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0lie in the same plane or not....\u00a0...So, as we noted prior to this example all we need to do is   compute the volume of the parallelepiped formed by these three vectors.\u00a0 If the volume is zero they lie in the same   plane and if the volume isn\u2019t zero they don\u2019t lie in the same plane....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the volume is zero and so they lie in the same plane.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/CrossProduct.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus II - Cross Product", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Now, that we know how to represent function as power series we can now talk about at least a couple of applications of series.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are in fact many applications of series, unfortunately most of them are beyond the scope of this course.\u00a0 One application of power series (with the occasional use of Taylor Series) is in the field of Ordinary Differential Equations when finding ....\u00a0 If you are interested in seeing how that works you can check out that chapter of my Differential Equations notes....\u00a0...Another application of series arises in the study of Partial Differential Equations.\u00a0 One of the more commonly used methods in that subject makes use of .......\u00a0...Many of the applications of series, especially those in the differential equations fields, rely on the fact that functions can be represented as a series.\u00a0 In these applications it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find the function itself.\u00a0 However, there are methods of determining the series representation for the unknown function....\u00a0...While the differential equations applications are beyond the scope of this course there are some applications from a Calculus setting that we can look at....\u00a0...Determine   a Taylor Series about ...\u00a0for the following integral....To do this we will first need to find a Taylor Series   about ...\u00a0for the integrand.\u00a0 This however isn\u2019t terribly difficult.\u00a0 We already have a Taylor Series for sine   about ...\u00a0so we\u2019ll just use that as follows,...\u00a0...We can now do the problem....\u00a0...So, while we can\u2019t integrate this function in terms of   known functions we can come up with a series representation for the integral....\u00a0...This idea of deriving a series representation for a function instead of trying to find the function itself is used quite often in several fields.\u00a0 In fact, there are some fields where this is one of the main ideas used and without this idea it would be very difficult to accomplish anything in those fields....\u00a0...Another application of series isn\u2019t really an application of infinite series.\u00a0 It\u2019s more an application of partial sums.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ve already seen this application in use once in this chapter.\u00a0 In the ... we used a partial sum to estimate the value of a series.\u00a0 We can do the same thing with power series and series representations of functions.\u00a0 The main difference is that we will now be using the partial sum to approximate a function instead of a single value....\u00a0...We will look at ... series for our examples, but we could just as easily use any series representation here.\u00a0 Recall that the ... is given by,...For   the function ...\u00a0plot the function as well as ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0on the same graph for the interval [-4,4]....\u00a0...\u00a0...Here is the general formula for the ... polynomials for cosine....\u00a0...The three ...   polynomials that we\u2019ve got are then,...\u00a0...Here is the graph of these three ... polynomials as well as the graph of   cosine....\u00a0...As we can see from this graph as we increase the degree of   the ...   polynomial it starts to look more and more like the function itself.\u00a0 In fact by the time we get to ...\u00a0the only difference is right at the   ends.\u00a0 The higher the degree of the ... polynomial the   better it approximates the function....\u00a0...Also the larger the interval the higher degree ... polynomial we   need to get a good approximation for the whole interval....\u00a0...Before moving on let\u2019s write down a couple more ... polynomials from the previous example.\u00a0 Notice that because the ... series for cosine doesn\u2019t contain any terms with odd powers on ... we get the following ... polynomials....\u00a0...\u00a0...These are identical to those used in the example.\u00a0 Sometimes this will happen although that was not really the point of this.\u00a0 The point is to notice that the nth degree ... polynomial may actually have a degree that is less than ....\u00a0 It will never be more than ..., but it can be less than .......\u00a0...The final example in this section really isn\u2019t an application of series and probably belonged in the previous section.\u00a0 However, the previous section was getting too long so the example is in this section.\u00a0 This is an example of how to multiply series together and while this isn\u2019t an application of series it is something that does have to be done on occasion in the applications.\u00a0 So, in that sense it does belong in this section....\u00a0...Find   the first three non-zero terms in the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...Before we start let\u2019s acknowledge that the easiest way to   do this problem is to simply compute the first 3-4 derivatives, evaluate them   at ...,   plug into the formula and we\u2019d be done.\u00a0   However, as we noted prior to this example we want to use this example   to illustrate how we multiply series....\u00a0...We will make use of the fact that we\u2019ve got Taylor Series   for each of these so we can use them in this problem....\u00a0...We\u2019re not going to completely multiply out these   series.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do enough of the   multiplication to get an answer.\u00a0 The   problem statement says that we want the first three ... terms. \u00a0That   non-zero bit is important as it is possible that some of the terms will be   zero.\u00a0 If none of the terms are zero   this would mean that the first three non-zero terms would be the constant   term, ... term, and ... term.\u00a0 However, because some might be zero let\u2019s   assume that if we get all the terms up through ... we\u2019ll have enough to get the answer.\u00a0 If we\u2019ve assumed wrong it will be very easy   to fix so don\u2019t worry about that....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s write down the first few terms of each series   and we\u2019ll stop at the ...   term in each....\u00a0...Note that we do need to acknowledge that these series   don\u2019t stop.\u00a0 That\u2019s the purpose of the   \u201c ...\u201d at the end of each.\u00a0 Just for a second however, let\u2019s suppose   that each of these did stop and ask ourselves how we would multiply each   out.\u00a0 If this were the case we would   take every term in the second and multiply by every term in the first.\u00a0 In other words, we would first multiply   every term in the second series by 1, then every term in the second series by   ..., then by ... ...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...By stopping each series at ... we have now guaranteed that we\u2019ll get all terms   that have an exponent of 4 or less.\u00a0 Do   you see why?\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Each of the terms that we neglected to write down have an   exponent of at least 5 and so multiplying by 1 or any power of ... will result in a term with an   exponent that is at a minimum 5.\u00a0   Therefore, none of the neglected terms will contribute terms with an   exponent of 4 or less and so weren\u2019t needed....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start the multiplication process....\u00a0...Now, collect like terms ignoring everything with an   exponent of 5 or more since we won\u2019t have all those terms and don\u2019t want them   either.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...There we go.\u00a0 It   looks like we over guessed and ended up with four non-zero terms, but that\u2019s   okay.\u00a0 If we had under guessed and it   turned out that we needed terms with ...   in them all we would need to do at this point is go back and add in those   terms to the original series and do a couple quick multiplications.\u00a0 In other words, there is no reason to   completely redo all the work.", "url":

quick rewrite of ...\u00a0gives,...and so the ...\u00a0in ...\u00a0holds the same place as the ... in ....\u00a0 Therefore, all we need to do is replace the   ... in ...   and we\u2019ve got a power series representation for .......\u00a0...Notice that we replaced both the ... in the power series and in the interval of convergence....\u00a0...All we need to do now is a little simplification....\u00a0...So, in this case the interval of convergence is the same   as the original power series.\u00a0 This   usually won\u2019t happen.\u00a0 More often than   not the new interval of convergence will be different from the original   interval of convergence....\u00a0...Find   a power series representation for the following function and determine its   interval of convergence....This function is similar to the previous function.\u00a0\u00a0 The difference is the numerator and at   first glance that looks to be an important difference.\u00a0 Since ...   doesn\u2019t have an ... in the numerator   it appears that we can\u2019t relate this function back to that....\u00a0...However, now that we\u2019ve worked the first example this one   is actually very simple since we can use the result of the answer from that   example.\u00a0 To see how to do this let\u2019s   first rewrite the function a little....\u00a0...Now, from the first example we\u2019ve already got a power   series for the second term so let\u2019s use that to write the function as,...\u00a0...Notice that the presence of ...\u2019s outside of the series will NOT affect its convergence and so   the interval of convergence remains the same....\u00a0...The last step is to bring the coefficient into the series   and we\u2019ll be done.\u00a0 When we do this   make sure and combine the ...\u2019s as   well.\u00a0 We typically only want a single ... in a power series....\u00a0...As we saw in the previous example we can often use previous results to help us out.\u00a0 This is an important idea to remember as it can often greatly simplify our work....\u00a0...Find   a power series representation for the following function and determine its   interval of convergence....So, again, we\u2019ve got an ... in the numerator.\u00a0 So, as   with the last example let\u2019s factor that out and see what we\u2019ve got left....\u00a0...If we had a power series representation for...we could get a power series representation for ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s find one.\u00a0   We\u2019ll first notice that in order to use (4)   we\u2019ll need the number in the denominator to be a one.\u00a0 That\u2019s easy enough to get....Now all we need to do to get a power series representation   is to replace the ... in ...   with ....\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s do a little simplification on the series....\u00a0...The interval of convergence for this series is,...\u00a0...Okay, this was the work for the power series   representation for ...\u00a0let\u2019s now find a power series representation   for the original function.\u00a0 All we need   to do for this is to multiply the power series representation for ...\u00a0by ...   and we\u2019ll have it....\u00a0...The interval of convergence doesn\u2019t change and so it will   be .......\u00a0...So, hopefully we now have an idea on how to find the power series representation for some functions.\u00a0 Admittedly all of the functions could be related back to ... but it\u2019s a start....\u00a0...We now need to look at some further manipulation of power series that we will need to do on occasion.\u00a0 We need to discuss differentiation and integration of power series....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with differentiation of the power series,...\u00a0...Now, we know that if we differentiate a finite sum of terms all we need to do is differentiate each of the terms and then add them back up.\u00a0 With infinite sums there are some subtleties involved that we need to be careful with, but are somewhat beyond the scope of this course.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Nicely enough for us however, it is known that if the power series representation of ...\u00a0has a radius of convergence of ...\u00a0then the term by term differentiation of the power series will also have a radius of convergence of ... and (more importantly) will in fact be the power series representation of ...\u00a0provided we stay within the radius of convergence.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Again, we should make the point that if we aren\u2019t dealing with a power series then we may or may not be able to differentiate each term of the series to get the derivative of the series....\u00a0...So, what all this means for us is that,...\u00a0...Note the initial value of this series.\u00a0 It has been changed from ...\u00a0to ....\u00a0 This is an acknowledgement of the fact that the derivative of the first term is zero and hence isn\u2019t in the derivative.\u00a0 Notice however, that since the ... term of the above series is also zero, we could start the series at ...\u00a0if it was required for a particular problem.\u00a0 In general however, this won\u2019t be done in this class....\u00a0...We can now find formulas for higher order derivatives as well now....\u00a0...Once again, notice that the initial value of ... changes with each differentiation in order to acknowledge that a term from the original series differentiated to zero....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now briefly talk about integration.\u00a0 Just as with the differentiation, when we\u2019ve got an infinite series we need to be careful about just integration term by term.\u00a0 Much like with derivatives it turns out that as long as we\u2019re working with power series we can just integrate the terms of the series to get the integral of the series itself.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that we pick up a constant of integration, ..., that is outside the series here....\u00a0...Let\u2019s summarize the differentiation and integration ideas before moving on to an example or two....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0has a radius of convergence of ...\u00a0then,...\u00a0...and both of these also have a radius of convergence of .......\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see how we can use these facts to generate some more power series representations of functions....\u00a0...Find   a power series representation for the following function and determine its   interval of convergence....To do this problem let\u2019s notice that ...Then since we\u2019ve got a power series representation for...all that we\u2019ll need to do is differentiate that power   series to get a power series representation for .......\u00a0...Then since the original power series had a radius of   convergence of ...\u00a0the derivative, and hence ..., will also have a radius of   convergence of .......\u00a0...Find   a power series representation for the following function and determine its   interval of convergence....In this case we need to notice that...and the recall that we have a power series representation   for ...\u00a0...Remember we found a representation for this in Example   3.\u00a0 So,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We can find the constant of integration, ..., by plugging in a value of ....\u00a0   A good choice is ...\u00a0since that will make the series easy to   evaluate....\u00a0...So, the final answer is,...\u00a0...Note that it is okay to have the constant sitting outside   of the series like this.\u00a0 In fact,   there is no way to bring it into the series so don\u2019t get excited about it.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/PowerSeriesandFunctions.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes :

If we were to write out the sum without the summation notation this would clearly be an n... degree polynomial.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see a nice application of ... polynomials in the next section....\u00a0...Notice as well that for the full Taylor Series,...the n... degree Taylor polynomial is just the partial sum for the series....\u00a0...Next, the ... is defined to be,...\u00a0...So, the remainder is really just the ... between the function ...\u00a0and the n... degree Taylor polynomial for a given .......\u00a0...With this definition note that we can then write the function as,...\u00a0...We now have the following Theorem....\u00a0...Suppose that ....\u00a0 Then if,...for ...\u00a0then,...on .......\u00a0...In general showing that ...\u00a0is a somewhat difficult process and so we will be assuming that this can be done for some ... in all of the examples that we\u2019ll be looking at....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s look at some examples....\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...This is actually one of the easier Taylor Series that   we\u2019ll be asked to compute.\u00a0 To find the   Taylor Series for a function we will need to determine a general formula for ....\u00a0 This is one of the few functions where this   is easy to do right from the start....\u00a0...To get a formula for ...\u00a0all we need to do is recognize that,...and so,...\u00a0...Therefore, the ...   series for ...\u00a0about ...   is,...\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...There are two ways to do this problem.\u00a0 Both are fairly simple, however one of them   requires significantly less work.\u00a0   We\u2019ll work both solutions since the longer one has some nice ideas   that we\u2019ll see in other examples....\u00a0...As with the first example we\u2019ll need to get a formula for ....\u00a0 However, unlike the first one we\u2019ve got a   little more work to do.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first   take some derivatives and evaluate them at .......\u00a0...After a couple of computations we were able to get general   formulas for both ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 We often won\u2019t be able to get a general   formula for ...\u00a0so don\u2019t get too excited about getting that   formula.\u00a0 Also, as we will see it won\u2019t   always be easy to get a general formula for .......\u00a0...So, in this case we\u2019ve got general formulas so all we need   to do is plug these into the Taylor Series formula and be done with the   problem....\u00a0...The previous solution wasn\u2019t too bad and we often have to   do things in that manner.\u00a0 However, in   this case there is a much shorter solution method.\u00a0 In the previous section we used series that   we\u2019ve already found to help us find a new series.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do the same thing with this one.\u00a0 We already know a Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about ...\u00a0and in this case the only difference is   we\u2019ve got a \u201c-...\u201d in the exponent   instead of just an ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, all we need to do is replace the ... in the Taylor Series that we found in the first example with \u201c-...\u201d....\u00a0...This is a much shorter method of arriving at the same   answer so don\u2019t forget about using previously computed series where possible   (and allowed of course)....\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...For this example we will take advantage of the fact that   we already have a Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about ....\u00a0 In this example, unlike the previous   example, doing this directly would be significantly longer and more   difficult....\u00a0...\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve only looked at Taylor Series about ...\u00a0(also known as Maclaurin Series) so let\u2019s take a look at a Taylor Series that isn\u2019t about ....\u00a0 Also, we\u2019ll pick on the exponential function one more time since it makes some of the work easier.\u00a0 This will be the final Taylor Series for exponentials in this section....\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...Finding a general formula for ...\u00a0is fairly simple....\u00a0...The Taylor Series is then,...\u00a0...Okay, we now need to work some examples that don\u2019t involve the exponential function since these will tend to require a little more work....\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...First we\u2019ll need to take some derivatives of the function   and evaluate them at .......\u00a0...In this example, unlike the previous ones, there is not an   easy formula for either the general derivative or the evaluation of the   derivative.\u00a0 However, there is a clear   pattern to the evaluations.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s   plug what we\u2019ve got into the ...   series and see what we get,...\u00a0...So, we only pick up terms with even powers on the ...\u2019s.\u00a0   This doesn\u2019t really help us to get a general formula for the Taylor   Series.\u00a0 However, let\u2019s drop the zeroes   and \u201crenumber\u201d the terms as follows to see what we can get....\u00a0...By renumbering the terms as we did we can actually come up   with a general formula for the Taylor Series and here it is,...\u00a0...This idea of renumbering the series terms as we did in the previous example isn\u2019t used all that often, but occasionally is very useful.\u00a0 There is one more series where we need to do it so let\u2019s take a look at that so we can get one more example down of renumbering series terms....\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...As with the last example we\u2019ll start off in the same   manner....\u00a0...So, we get a similar pattern for this one.\u00a0 Let\u2019s plug the numbers into the Taylor   Series....\u00a0...In this case we only get terms that have an odd exponent   on ... and as with the last problem   once we ignore the zero terms there is a clear pattern and formula.\u00a0 So renumbering the terms as we did in the   previous example we get the following Taylor Series....\u00a0...We really need to work another example or two in which ... isn\u2019t about .......\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......\u00a0...Here are the first few derivatives and the evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that while we got a general formula here it doesn\u2019t   work for ....\u00a0 This will happen on occasion so don\u2019t worry   about it when it does....\u00a0...In order to plug this into the Taylor Series formula we\u2019ll   need to strip out the ...\u00a0term first....\u00a0...Notice that we simplified the factorials in this   case.\u00a0 You should always simplify them   if there are more than one and it\u2019s possible to simplify them. ...\u00a0...Also, do not get excited about the term sitting in front   of the series.\u00a0 Sometimes we need to do   that when we can\u2019t get a general formula that will hold for all values of .......\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......Again, here are the derivatives and evaluations....\u00a0...Notice that all the negative signs will cancel out in the   evaluation.\u00a0 Also, this formula will   work for all ..., unlike the previous   example....\u00a0...Here is the Taylor Series for this function....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s work one of the easier examples in this section.\u00a0 The problem for most students is that it may not appear to be that easy (or maybe it will appear to be too easy) at first glance....\u00a0...Find   the Taylor Series for ...\u00a0about .......Here are the derivatives for this problem....\u00a0...This Taylor series will terminate after ....\u00a0 This will always happen when we are finding   the Taylor Series of a polynomial.\u00a0   Here is the Taylor Series for this one....\u00a0...When finding the Taylor Series of a polynomial we don\u2019t do   any simplification of the right hand side.\u00a0   We leave it like it is.\u00a0 In   fact, if we were to multiply everything out we just get back to the original   polynomial!...\u00a0...While it\u2019s not apparent that writing the Taylor Series for   a polynomial is useful there are times where this needs to be done.\u00a0 The problem is that they are beyond the   scope of this course and so aren\u2019t covered here.\u00a0 For example, there is one application to   series in the field of Differential Equations where this needs to be done on   occasion....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve seen quite a few examples of Taylor Series to this point and in all of them we were able to find general formulas for the series.\u00a0 This won\u2019t always be the case.\u00a0 To see an example of one that doesn\u2019t have a general formula check out the last example in the next section....\u00a0...Before leaving this section there are three important Taylor Series that we\u2019ve derived in this section that we should summarize up in one place.\u00a0 In my class I will assume that you know these formulas from this

take a quick look at a couple of examples of absolute convergence....\u00a0...Determine   if each of the following series are absolute convergent, conditionally   convergent or divergent....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This is the alternating harmonic series and we saw in the   last section that it is a convergent series so we don\u2019t need to check that   here.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s see if it is an   absolutely convergent series.\u00a0 To do   this we\u2019ll need to check the convergence of. ...\u00a0...This is the harmonic series and we know from the integral   test section that it is divergent....\u00a0...Therefore, this series is not absolutely convergent.\u00a0 It is however conditionally convergent   since the series itself does converge....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case let\u2019s just check absolute convergence first   since if it\u2019s absolutely convergent we won\u2019t need to bother checking   convergence as we will get that for free....\u00a0...This series is convergent by the ...-series test and so the series is absolute convergent.\u00a0 Note that this does say as well that it\u2019s a   convergent series....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this part we need to be a little careful.\u00a0 First, this is NOT an alternating series   and so we can\u2019t use any tools from that section....\u00a0...What we\u2019ll do here is check for absolute convergence first   again since that will also give convergence.\u00a0   This means that we need to check the convergence of the following   series....\u00a0...To do this we\u2019ll need to note that...and so we have,...\u00a0...Now we know that ...converges by the ...-series   test and so by the Comparison Test we also know that ...converges....\u00a0...Therefore the original series is absolutely convergent   (and hence convergent)....\u00a0...Let\u2019s close this section off by recapping a topic we ... earlier.\u00a0 When we first discussed the convergence of series in detail we noted that we can\u2019t think of series as an infinite sum because some series can have different sums if we rearrange their terms.\u00a0 In fact, we gave two rearrangements of an Alternating Harmonic series that gave two different values.\u00a0 We closed that section off with the following fact,...\u00a0...Given the series ...,...\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve got the tools under our belt to determine absolute and conditional convergence we can make a few more comments about this....\u00a0...First, as we showed above in Example 1a an Alternating Harmonic is conditionally convergent and so no matter what value we chose there is some rearrangement of terms that will give that value.\u00a0 Note as well that this fact does not tell us what that rearrangement must be only that it does exist....\u00a0...Next, we showed in Example 1b that,...is absolutely convergent and so no matter how we rearrange the terms of this series we\u2019ll always get the same value.\u00a0 In fact, it can be shown that the value of

some values of ... and not for other values of .......\u00a0...Before we get too far into power series there is some terminology that we need to get out of the way.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, as we will see in our examples, we will be able to show that there is a number ... so that the power series will converge for, ...and will diverge for ....\u00a0 This number is called the ... for the

value of .... \u00a0Therefore, to completely identify the interval of convergence all that we have to do is determine if the power series will converge for ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 If the power series converges for one or both of these values then we\u2019ll need to include those in the interval of convergence....\u00a0...Before getting into some examples let\u2019s take a quick look at the convergence of a power series for the case of ....\u00a0 In this case the power series becomes,...and so the power series converges.\u00a0 Note that we had to strip out the first term since it was the

converge for any other value of ..., but it will always converge for .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some examples.\u00a0 We\u2019ll put quite a bit of detail into the first example and then not put

will converge for ...,   but that\u2019s it at this point.\u00a0 To   determine the remainder of the ...\u2019s   for which we\u2019ll get convergence we can use any of the tests that we\u2019ve   discussed to this point.\u00a0 After   application of the test that we choose to work with we will arrive at   condition(s) on ... that we can use   to determine which values of ... for   which the power series will converge and which values of ... for which the power series will diverge.\u00a0 From this we can get the radius of   convergence and most of the interval of convergence (with the possible   exception of the endpoints)....\u00a0...With all that said, the best tests to use here are almost   always the ratio or root test.\u00a0 Most of   the power series that we\u2019ll be looking at are set up for one or the   other.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll use the   ratio test....\u00a0...\u00a0...Before going any farther with the limit let\u2019s notice that   since ... is not dependent on the   limit it can be factored out of the limit.\u00a0 Notice as well that in doing this we'll need   to keep the absolute value bars on it since we need to make sure everything   stays positive and ... could well be   a value that will make things negative.\u00a0   The limit is then,...So, the ratio test tells us that if ...\u00a0the series will converge, if ...\u00a0the series will

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We have now spent quite a few sections determining the convergence of a series, however, with the exception of geometric and telescoping series, we have not talked about finding the value of a series.\u00a0 This is usually a very difficult thing to do and we still aren\u2019t going to talk about how to find the value of a series.\u00a0 What we will do is talk about how to estimate the value of a series.\u00a0 Often that is all that you need to know....\u00a0...Before we get into how to estimate the value of a series let\u2019s remind ourselves how series convergence works.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t make any sense to talk about the value of a series that doesn\u2019t converge and so we will be assuming that the series we\u2019re working with converges.\u00a0 Also, as we'll see the main method of estimating the value of series will come out of this discussion....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start with the series ...\u00a0(the starting point is not important, but we need a starting point to do the work) and let\u2019s suppose that the series converges to ....\u00a0 Recall that this means that if we get the partial sums,...then they will form a convergent sequence and its limit is ....\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...Now, just what does this mean for us?\u00a0 Well, since this limit converges it means that we can make the partial sums, ..., as close to ... as we want simply by taking ... large enough.\u00a0 In other words, if we take ... large enough then we can say that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is one method of estimating the value of a series.\u00a0 We can just take a partial sum and use that as an estimation of the value of the series.\u00a0 There are now two questions that we should ask about this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, how good is the estimation?\u00a0 If we don\u2019t have an idea of how good the estimation is then it really doesn\u2019t do all that much for us as an estimation....\u00a0...Secondly, is there any way to make the estimate better?\u00a0 Sometimes we can use this as a starting point and make the estimation better.\u00a0 We won\u2019t always be able to do this, but if we can that will be nice....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start with a general discussion about the determining how good the estimation is.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first start with the full series and strip out the first ... terms.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we converted over to an index of ... in order to make the notation consistent with prior notation.\u00a0 Recall that we can use any letter for the index and it won\u2019t change the value....\u00a0...Now, notice that the first series (the ... terms that we\u2019ve stripped out) is nothing more than the partial sum ....\u00a0 The second series on the right (the one starting at ...) is called the remainder and denoted by ....\u00a0 Finally let\u2019s acknowledge that we also know the value of the series since we are assuming it\u2019s convergent.\u00a0 Taking this notation into account we can rewrite ... as,...\u00a0...We can solve this for the remainder to get,...\u00a0...So, the remainder tells us the difference, or error, between the exact value of the series and the value of the partial sum that we are using as the estimation of the value of the series....\u00a0...Of course we can\u2019t get our hands on the actual value of the remainder because we don\u2019t have the actual value of the series.\u00a0 However, we can use some of the tests that we\u2019ve got for convergence to get a pretty good estimate of the remainder provided we make some assumptions about the series.\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve got an estimate on the value of the remainder we\u2019ll also have an idea on just how good a job the partial sum does of estimating the actual value of the series....\u00a0...There are several tests that will allow us to get estimates of the remainder.\u00a0 We\u2019ll go through each one separately....\u00a0...Recall that in this case we will need to assume that the series terms are all positive and will eventually be decreasing.\u00a0 We derived the integral test by using the fact that the series could be thought of as an estimation of the area under the curve of ...\u00a0where ....\u00a0 We can do something similar with the remainder....\u00a0...As we\u2019ll soon see if we can get an upper and lower bound on the value of the remainder we can use these bounds to help us get upper and lower bounds on the value of the series.  We can in turn use the upper and lower bounds on the series value to actually estimate the value of the series....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s first recall that the remainder is,...Now, if we start at ..., take rectangles of width 1 and use the left endpoint as the height of the rectangle we can estimate the area under ...\u00a0on the interval ...\u00a0as shown in the sketch below....\u00a0...We can see that the remainder, ..., is the area estimation and it will overestimate the exact area.\u00a0 So, we have the following inequality....\u00a0...Next, we could also estimate the area by starting at ..., taking rectangles of width 1 again and then using the right endpoint as the height of the rectangle.\u00a0 This will give an estimation of the area under ...\u00a0on the interval ....\u00a0 This is shown in the following sketch....\u00a0...Again, we can see that the remainder, ..., is again this estimation and in this case it will underestimate the area.\u00a0 This leads to the following inequality,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Combining ... and ... gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, provided we can do these integrals we can get both an upper and lower bound on the remainder.\u00a0 This will in turn give us an upper bound and a lower bound on just how good the partial sum, ..., is as an estimation of the actual value of the series....\u00a0...In this case we can also use these results to get a better estimate for the actual value of the series as well....\u00a0...First, we\u2019ll start with the fact that...Now, if we use ... we get,...Likewise if we use ... we get,...\u00a0...Putting these two together gives us,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...This gives an upper and a lower bound on the actual value of the series.\u00a0 We could then use as an estimate of the actual value of the series the average of the upper and lower bound....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work an example with this....\u00a0...Using   ...\u00a0to estimate the value of .......First, for comparison purposes, we\u2019ll note that the actual   value of this series is known to be,...\u00a0...Using ...\u00a0let\u2019s first get the partial sum....\u00a0...Note that this is \u201cclose\u201d to the actual value in some   sense, but isn\u2019t really all that close either....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s compute the integrals.\u00a0 These are fairly simple integrals so we\u2019ll   leave it to you to verify the values....\u00a0...Plugging these into ...   gives us,...\u00a0...Both the upper and lower bound are now very close to the   actual value and if we take the average of the two we get the following   estimate of the actual value....\u00a0...\u00a0...That is pretty darn close to the actual value....\u00a0...So, that is how we can use the Integral Test to estimate the value of a series.\u00a0 Let\u2019s move on to the next test....\u00a0...In this case, unlike with the integral test, we may or may not be able to get an idea of how good a particular partial sum will be as an estimate of the exact value of the series.\u00a0 Much of this will depend on how the comparison test is used....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s remind ourselves on how the comparison test actually works.\u00a0 Given a series ...\u00a0let\u2019s assume that we\u2019ve used the comparison test to show that it\u2019s convergent.\u00a0 Therefore, we found a second series ...\u00a0that converged and ...\u00a0for all .......\u00a0...What we want to do is determine how good of a job the partial sum,...will do in estimating the actual value of the series ....\u00a0 Again, we will use the remainder to do this.\u00a0 Let\u2019s actually write down the remainder for both series....\u00a0...Now, since ...\u00a0we also know that ...\u00a0...When using the comparison test it is often the case that the ... are fairly nice terms and that we might actually be able to get an idea on the size of ...\u00a0 For instance, if our second series is a ...-series we can use the results from above to get an upper bound on ... as follows,...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Also, if the second series is a geometric series then we will be able to compute ... exactly....\u00a0...If we are unable to get an idea of the size of ... then using the comparison test to help with estimates won\u2019t do us much good....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Using   ...\u00a0to estimate the value of .......To do this we\u2019ll first need to go through the comparison   test so we can get the second series.\u00a0   So,...and ...is a geometric series and converges because .......\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve gotten our second series let\u2019s get the   estimate....\u00a0...So, how good is it?\u00a0   Well we know that,...will be an upper bound for the error between the actual   value and the estimate.\u00a0 Since our   second series is a geometric series we can compute this directly as follows....\u00a0...The series on the left is in the standard form and so we   can compute that directly.\u00a0 The first   series on the right has a finite number of terms and so can be computed   exactly and the second series on the right is the one that we\u2019d like to have   the value for.\u00a0 Doing the work gives,...\u00a0...So, according to this if we use...as an estimate of the actual value we will be off from the   exact value by no more than ...\u00a0and that\u2019s not too bad.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case it can be shown that ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and so we can   see that the actual error in our estimation is,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that in this case the estimate of the error is   actually fairly close (and in fact exactly the same) as the actual   error.\u00a0 This will not always happen and   so we shouldn\u2019t expect that to happen in all cases. \u00a0The error estimate above is simply the upper   bound on the error and the actual error will often be less than this value. ...\u00a0...Before moving on to the final part of this section let\u2019s again note that we will only be able to determine how good the estimate is using the comparison test if we can easily get our hands on the remainder of the second term.\u00a0 The reality is that we won\u2019t always be able to do this....\u00a0...Both of the methods that we\u2019ve looked at so far have required the series to contain only positive terms.\u00a0 If we allow series to have negative terms in it the process is usually more difficult.\u00a0 However, with that said there is one case where it isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 That is the case of an alternating series....\u00a0...Once again we will start off with a convergent series ...\u00a0which in this case happens to be an alternating series that satisfies the conditions of the alternating series test, so we know that ...\u00a0for all ....\u00a0 Also note that we could have any power on the \u201c-1\u201d we just used ... for the sake of convenience.\u00a0 We want to know how good of an estimation of the actual series value will the partial sum, ..., be.\u00a0 As with the prior cases we know that the remainder, ..., will be the error in the estimation and so if we can get a handle on that we\u2019ll know approximately how good the estimation is....\u00a0...From the ... of the Alternating Series Test we can see that ... will lie between ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0for any ... and so,...\u00a0...Therefore,...\u00a0...We needed absolute value bars because we won\u2019t know ahead of time if the estimation is larger or smaller than the actual value and we know that the ...\u2019s are positive....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Using   ...\u00a0to estimate the value of .......This is an alternating series and it does converge.\u00a0 In this case the exact value is known and   so for comparison purposes,...\u00a0...Now, the estimation is,...\u00a0...From the fact above we know that ...\u00a0...So, our estimation will have an error of no more than   0.00390625.\u00a0 In this case the exact   value is known and so the actual error is,...\u00a0...In the previous example the estimation had only half the estimated error.\u00a0 It will often be the case that the actual error will be less than the estimated error.\u00a0 Remember that this is only an upper bound for the actual error....\u00a0...This will be the final case that we\u2019re going to look at for estimating series values and we are going to have to put a couple of fairly stringent restrictions on the series terms in order to do the work.\u00a0 One of the main restrictions we\u2019re going to make is to assume that the series terms are positive.\u00a0 We'll also be adding on another restriction in a bit....\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ve used the ratio test to show that ...\u00a0is convergent.\u00a0 To do this we computed ...and found that .......\u00a0...As with the previous cases we are going to use the remainder, ..., to determine how good of an estimation of the actual value the partial sum, ..., is....\u00a0...To get an estimate of the remainder let\u2019s first define the   following sequence,...\u00a0...We now have two possible cases....\u00a0...\u00a0...Both parts will   need the following work so we\u2019ll do it first.\u00a0   We\u2019ll start with the remainder....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next we need to   do a little work on a couple of these terms....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now use the   definition of ...\u00a0to write this as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay now let\u2019s   do the proof....\u00a0...For the first   part we are assuming that ...\u00a0is decreasing and so we can estimate the   remainder as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally, the   series here is a geometric series and because ...\u00a0we know that it converges and we can compute   its value.\u00a0

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to take a look at a test that we can use to see if a series is absolutely convergent or not.\u00a0 Recall that if a series is absolutely convergent then we will also know that it\u2019s convergent and so we will often use it to simply determine the convergence of a series.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before proceeding with the test let\u2019s do a quick reminder of factorials.\u00a0 This test will be particularly useful for series that contain factorials (and we will see some in the applications) so let\u2019s make sure we can deal with them before we run into them in an example....\u00a0...If ... is an integer such that ...then ... factorial is defined as,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s compute a couple real quick....\u00a0...In the last computation above, notice that we could rewrite the factorial in a couple of different ways.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...In general we can always \u201cstrip out\u201d terms from a factorial as follows....\u00a0...We will need to do this on occasion so don\u2019t forget about it....\u00a0...Also, when dealing with factorials we need to be very careful with parenthesis.\u00a0 For instance, ...\u00a0as we can see if we write each of the following factorials out....\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, we will run across factorials with parenthesis so don\u2019t drop them.\u00a0 This is often one of the more common mistakes that students make when they first run across factorials....\u00a0...Okay, we are now ready for the test....\u00a0...Suppose we have the series ....\u00a0 Define,...Then,...\u00a0...A ... of this test is at the end of the section....\u00a0...Notice that in the case of ...\u00a0the ratio test is pretty much worthless and we would need to resort to a different test to determine the convergence of the series....\u00a0...Also, the absolute value bars in the definition of ... are absolutely required.\u00a0 If they are not there it will be possible for us to get the incorrect answer....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....\u00a0...With this first example let\u2019s be a little careful and make   sure that we have everything down correctly.\u00a0   Here are the series terms .......\u00a0...Recall that to compute ...   all that we need to do is substitute ...   for all the ...\u2019s in .... ...\u00a0...Now, to define ...   we will use,...since this will be a little easier when dealing with   fractions as we\u2019ve got here.\u00a0 So,...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0and so by the Ratio Test the series   converges absolutely and hence will converge....\u00a0...As seen in the previous example there is usually a lot of canceling that will happen in these.\u00a0 Make sure that you do this canceling.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t do this kind of canceling it can make the limit fairly difficult....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve worked one in detail we won\u2019t go into quite   the detail with the rest of these.\u00a0   Here is the limit....\u00a0...In order to do this limit we will need to eliminate the   factorials.\u00a0 We simply can\u2019t do the   limit with the factorials in it.\u00a0 To   eliminate the factorials we will recall from our discussion on factorials   above that we can always \u201cstrip out\u201d terms from a factorial.\u00a0 If we do that with the numerator (in this   case because it\u2019s the larger of the two) we get,...at which point we can cancel the ...! for the numerator an denominator to get,...\u00a0...So, by the Ratio Test this series diverges....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....\u00a0...In this case be careful in dealing with the factorials....\u00a0...So, by the Ratio Test this series converges absolutely and   so converges....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....\u00a0...Do not mistake this for a ....\u00a0 The ...   in the denominator means that this isn\u2019t a geometric series.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s compute the limit....\u00a0...Therefore, by the Ratio Test this series is divergent....\u00a0...In the previous example the absolute value bars were required to get the correct answer.\u00a0 If we hadn\u2019t used them we would have gotten ...\u00a0which would have implied a convergent series!...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples to see what happens when we get ....\u00a0 Recall that the ratio test will not tell us anything about the convergence of these series.\u00a0 In both of these examples we will first verify that we get ...\u00a0and then use other tests to determine the convergence....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....Let\u2019s first get .......\u00a0...So, as implied earlier we get ...\u00a0which means the ratio test is no good for   determining the convergence of this series.\u00a0   We will need to resort to another test for this series.\u00a0 This series is an alternating series and so   let\u2019s check the two conditions from that test....\u00a0...The two conditions are met and so by the Alternating   Series Test this series is convergent.\u00a0   We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify this series is also absolutely   convergent....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....Here\u2019s the limit....\u00a0...Again, the ratio test tells us nothing here.\u00a0 We can however, quickly use the divergence   test on this.\u00a0 In fact that probably   should have been our first choice on this one anyway....\u00a0...By the Divergence Test this series is divergent....\u00a0...So, as we saw in the previous two examples if we get ...\u00a0from the ratio test the series can be either convergent or divergent.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There is one more thing that we should note about the ratio test before we move onto the next section.\u00a0 The last series was a polynomial divided by a polynomial and we saw that we got ...\u00a0from the ratio test.\u00a0 This will always happen with rational expression involving only polynomials or polynomials under radicals.\u00a0 So, in the future it isn\u2019t even worth it to try the ratio test on these kinds of problems since we now know that we will get .......\u00a0...Also, in the second to last example we saw an example of an alternating series in which the positive term was a rational expression involving polynomials and again we will always get ...\u00a0in these cases....\u00a0...Let\u2019s close the section out with a proof of the Ratio Test....\u00a0...First note that   we can assume without loss of generality that the series will start at ...\u00a0as we\u2019ve done for all our series test   proofs....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off   the proof here by assuming that ...\u00a0and we\u2019ll need to show that ...\u00a0is absolutely convergent.\u00a0 To do this let\u2019s first note that because ...\u00a0there is some number ... such that .......\u00a0...Now, recall   that,...and because we   also have chosen ... such that ...\u00a0there is some ... such that if ...\u00a0we will have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, consider   the

...\u00a0...So, for ...\u00a0we have ....\u00a0 Just why is this important?\u00a0 Well we can now look at the following

be a test for alternating series.\u00a0 An ... is any series, ..., for which the series terms can be written in one of the following two forms....\u00a0...There are many other ways to deal with the

Comparison/Limit Comparison Test, this test will only tell us when a series converges and not if a series will diverge....\u00a0...Secondly, in the second condition all that we need to require is that the series terms, ...\u00a0will be eventually decreasing.\u00a0 It is possible for the first few terms of a series to increase and still have the test be valid.\u00a0 All that is required is that

...\u00a0or any other form of alternating sign and we\u2019d still call it an Alternating Harmonic Series....\u00a0...In the previous example it was easy to see that the series terms decreased since increasing ... only increased the denominator for the term and hence made the term smaller.\u00a0 In general however we will need to resort to Calculus I techniques to prove the series terms decrease.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see an example of this in a bit....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....First, identify the ...   for the test....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check the conditions....\u00a0...So, the first condition isn\u2019t met and so there is no   reason to check the second.\u00a0 Since this   condition isn\u2019t met we\u2019ll need to use another test to check convergence.\u00a0 In these cases where the first condition   isn\u2019t met it is usually best to use the divergence test....\u00a0...So, the divergence test requires us to compute the following   limit....\u00a0...This limit can be somewhat tricky to evaluate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For a second let\u2019s consider the   following, ...\u00a0...Splitting this limit like this can\u2019t be done because this   operation requires that both limits exist and while the second one does the   first clearly does not.\u00a0 However, it   does show us how we can at least convince ourselves that the overall limit   does not exist (even if it won\u2019t be a direct proof of that fact)....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start with,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, the second   part of this clearly is going to 1 as ...\u00a0while the first part just alternates between   1 and -1.\u00a0 So, as ...\u00a0the terms are alternating between positive   and negative values that are getting closer and closer to 1 and -1   respectively....\u00a0...In order for   limits to exist we know that the terms need to settle down to a single number   and since these clearly don\u2019t this limit doesn\u2019t exist and so by the   Divergence Test this series diverges....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....Notice that in this case the exponent on the \u201c-1\u201d isn\u2019t ... or ....\u00a0 That won\u2019t change how   the test works however so we won\u2019t worry about that.\u00a0 In this case we have,...so let\u2019s check the conditions....\u00a0...The first is easy enough to check....\u00a0...The second condition requires some work however.\u00a0 It is not immediately clear that these   terms will decrease.\u00a0 Increasing ... to ... will increase both the numerator and the denominator.\u00a0 Increasing the numerator says the term   should also increase while increasing the denominator says that the term   should decrease.\u00a0 Since it\u2019s not clear   which of these will win out we will need to resort to Calculus I techniques   to show that the terms decrease....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the following function and its   derivative....\u00a0...Now, there are three critical points for this function, ...,   ...,   and ....\u00a0 The first is outside the bound of our   series so we won\u2019t need to worry about that one. \u00a0Using the test points,...and so we can see that the function in increasing on ...\u00a0and decreasing on ....\u00a0 Therefore, since ...\u00a0we know as well that the ... are also increasing on ...\u00a0and decreasing on ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The ...   are then eventually decreasing and so the second condition is met....\u00a0...Both conditions are met and so by the Alternating Series   Test the series must be converging....\u00a0...As the previous example has shown, we sometimes need to do a fair amount of work to show that the terms are decreasing.\u00a0 Do not just make the assumption that the terms will be decreasing and let it go at that....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do one more example just to make a point....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....\u00a0...The point of this problem is really just to acknowledge   that it is in fact an alternating series.\u00a0   To see this we need to acknowledge that,...and so the series is really,...\u00a0...Checking the two condition gives,...\u00a0...The two conditions of the test are met and so by the   Alternating Series Test the series is convergent....\u00a0...It should be pointed out that the rewrite we did in previous example only works because ... is an integer and because of the presence of the ....\u00a0 Without the ...\u00a0\u00a0we couldn\u2019t do this and if ... wasn\u2019t guaranteed to be an integer we couldn\u2019t do this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s close this section out with a proof of the Alternating Series Test....\u00a0...\u00a0...Without loss of   generality we can assume that the series starts at ....\u00a0 If not we could modify the proof below to   meet the new starting place or we could do an ... to get the series to   start at .......\u00a0...First, notice   that because the terms of the sequence are decreasing for any two successive   terms we can say,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take   a look at the even partial sums....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is an increasing sequence....\u00a0...Next, we can   also write the general term as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Each of the   quantities in parenthesis are positive and by assumption we know that ...\u00a0is also positive.\u00a0 So, this tells us that ...\u00a0for all .......\u00a0...We now know   that ...\u00a0is an increasing sequence that is bounded   above and so we ...   that it must also converge.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s   assume that its limit is ... or,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, we can   quickly determine the limit of the sequence of odd partial sums, ...,   as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we now know   that both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are convergent sequences and they both have   the same limit and so we also ...   that ...\u00a0is a convergent sequence with a limit of ....\u00a0   This in

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to take a brief look at three special series.\u00a0 Actually, special may not be the correct term.\u00a0 All three have been named which makes them special in some way, however the main reason that we\u2019re going to look at two of them in this section is that they are the only types of series that we\u2019ll be looking at for which we will be able to get actual values for the series.\u00a0 The third type is divergent and so won\u2019t have a value to worry about....\u00a0...In general, determining the value of a series is very difficult and outside of these two kinds of series that we\u2019ll look at in this section we will not be determining the value of series in this chapter....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started....\u00a0...A geometric series is any series that can be written in the form,...or, with an ... the geometric series will often be written as,...\u00a0...These are identical series and will have identical values, provided they converge of course....\u00a0...If we start with the first form it can be shown that the partial sums are,...\u00a0...The series will converge provided the partial sums form a convergent sequence, so let\u2019s take the limit of the partial sums....\u00a0...Now, from ... from the Sequences section we know that the limit above will exist and be finite provided ....\u00a0 However, note that we can\u2019t let ...\u00a0since this will give division by zero.\u00a0 Therefore, this will exist and be finite provided ...\u00a0and in this case the limit is zero and so we get,...\u00a0...Therefore, a geometric series will converge if ..., which is usually written ..., its value is,...\u00a0...Note that in using this formula we\u2019ll need to make sure that we are in the correct form.\u00a0 In other words, if the series starts at ...\u00a0then the exponent on the ... must be ....\u00a0 Likewise if the series starts at ...\u00a0then the exponent on the ... must be .......\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converge or diverge.\u00a0   If they converge give the value of the series....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This series doesn\u2019t really look like a geometric   series.\u00a0 However, notice that both   parts of the series term are numbers raised to a power.\u00a0 This means that it can be put into the form   of a geometric series.\u00a0 We will just   need to decide which form is the correct form.\u00a0 Since the series starts at ...\u00a0we will want the exponents on the numbers to   be .......\u00a0...It will be fairly easy to get this into the correct   form.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first rewrite things   slightly.\u00a0 One of the ...\u2019s in the exponent has a negative in   front of it and that can\u2019t be there in the geometric form.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s first get rid of that....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s get the correct exponent on each of the   numbers.\u00a0 This can be done using simple   exponent properties....\u00a0...Now, rewrite the term a little....\u00a0...So, this is a geometric series with ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Therefore, since ...\u00a0we know the series will converge and its   value will be,...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Again, this doesn\u2019t look like a geometric series, but it   can be put into the correct form.\u00a0 In   this case the series starts at ...\u00a0so we\u2019ll need the exponents to be ... on the terms.\u00a0 Note that this means we\u2019re going to need to   rewrite the exponent on the numerator a little...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got it into the correct form and we can see that   ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Also note that ...\u00a0and so this series diverges....\u00a0...Back in the ... section we talked about stripping out terms from a series, but didn\u2019t really provide any examples of how this idea could be used in practice.\u00a0 We can now do some examples....\u00a0...Use   the results from the previous example to determine the value of the following   series....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case we could just acknowledge that this is a   geometric series that starts at ...\u00a0and so we could put it into the correct form   and be done with it.\u00a0 However, this   does provide us with a nice example of how to use the idea of stripping out   terms to our advantage....\u00a0...Let\u2019s notice that if we strip out the first term from this   series we arrive at,...\u00a0...From the previous example we know the value of the new   series that arises here and so the value of the series in this example is,...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case we can\u2019t strip out terms from the given   series to arrive at the series used in the previous example.\u00a0 However, we can start with the series used   in the previous example and strip terms out of it to get the series in this   example.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 We will strip out the first two terms from   the series we looked at in the previous example....\u00a0...We can now use the value of the series from the previous   example to get the value of this series....\u00a0...Notice that we didn\u2019t discuss the convergence of either of the series in the above example.\u00a0 Here\u2019s why.\u00a0 Consider the following series written in two separate ways (... we stripped out a couple of terms from it)....\u00a0...Let\u2019s suppose that we know ...\u00a0is a convergent series.\u00a0 This means that it\u2019s got a finite value and adding three finite terms onto this will not change that fact.\u00a0 So the value of ...\u00a0is also finite and so is convergent....\u00a0...Likewise, suppose that ...\u00a0is convergent.\u00a0 In this case if we subtract three finite values from this value we will remain finite and arrive at the value of ....\u00a0 This is now a finite value and so this series will also be convergent....\u00a0...In other words, if we have two series and they differ only by the presence, or absence, of a finite number of finite terms they will either both be convergent or they will both be divergent.\u00a0 The difference of a few terms one way or the other will not change the convergence of a series.\u00a0 This is an important idea and we will use it several times in the following sections to simplify some of the tests that we\u2019ll be looking at....\u00a0... ...It\u2019s now time to look at the second of the three series in this section.\u00a0 In this portion we are going to look at a series that is called a telescoping series.\u00a0 The name in this case comes from what happens with the partial sums and is best shown in an example....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges.\u00a0 If it converges find its value....We first need the partial sums for this series....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s notice that we can use partial fractions on the   series term to get,...\u00a0...I\u2019ll leave the details of the partial fractions to   you.\u00a0 By now you should be fairly adept   at this since we spent a fair amount of time doing partial fractions ... in the Integration Techniques   chapter.\u00a0 If you need a refresher you   should go back and review that section....\u00a0...So, what does this do for us?\u00a0 Well, let\u2019s start writing out the terms of   the general partial sum for this series using the partial fraction form....\u00a0...Notice that every term except the first and last term   canceled out.\u00a0 This is the origin of   the name .......\u00a0...This also means that we can determine the convergence of   this series by taking the limit of the partial sums....\u00a0...The sequence of partial sums is convergent and so the   series is convergent and has a value of ...\u00a0...In telescoping series be careful to not assume that successive terms will be the ones that cancel.\u00a0 Consider the following example....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges.\u00a0 If it converges find its value....As with the last example we\u2019ll leave the partial fractions   details to you to verify.\u00a0 The partial   sums are,...\u00a0...In this case instead of successive terms canceling a term   will cancel with a term that is farther down the list.\u00a0 The end result this time is two initial and   two final terms are left.\u00a0 Notice as   well that in order to help with the work a little we factored the ...\u00a0out of the series.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The limit of the partial sums is,...\u00a0...So, this series is convergent (because the partial sums   form a convergent sequence) and its value is,...\u00a0...Note that it\u2019s not always obvious if a series is telescoping or not until you try to get the partial sums and then see if they are in fact telescoping.\u00a0 There is no test that will tell us that we\u2019ve got a telescoping series right off the bat.\u00a0 Also note that just because you can do partial fractions on a series term does not mean that the series will be a telescoping series.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The following series, for example, is not a telescoping series despite the fact that we can partial fraction the series terms....\u00a0...\u00a0...In order for a series to be a telescoping series we must get terms to cancel and all of these terms are positive and so none will cancel....\u00a0...Next, we need to go back and address an issue that was first raised in the ....\u00a0 In that section we stated that the sum or difference of convergent series was also convergent and that the presence of a multiplicative constant would not affect the convergence of a series.\u00a0 Now that we have a few more series in hand let\u2019s work a quick example showing that....\u00a0...Determine   the value of the following series....To get the value of this series all we need to do is   rewrite it and then use the previous results....\u00a0...We didn\u2019t discuss the convergence of this series because   it was the sum of two convergent series and that guaranteed that the original   series would also be convergent....\u00a0...This is the third and final series that we\u2019re going to look at in this section.\u00a0 Here is the harmonic series....\u00a0...The harmonic series is divergent and we\u2019ll need to wait until the next section to show that.\u00a0 This series is here because it\u2019s got a name and so I wanted to put it here with the other two named series that we looked at in this section.\u00a0 We\u2019re also going to use the harmonic series to illustrate a couple of ideas about divergent series that we\u2019ve already discussed for convergent series.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do that with the following example....\u00a0...Show   that each of the following series are divergent.... ...To see that this series is divergent all we need to do is   use the fact that we can factor a constant out of a series as follows,...\u00a0...Now, ...\u00a0is divergent and so five times this will   still not be a finite number and so the series has to be divergent.\u00a0 In other words, if we multiply a divergent   series by a constant it will still be divergent....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...In this case we\u2019ll start with the harmonic series and   strip out the first three terms....\u00a0...In this case we are subtracting a finite number from a   divergent series.\u00a0 This subtraction   will not change the divergence of the series.\u00a0   We will either have infinity minus a finite number, which is still   infinity, or a series with no value minus a finite number, which will still   have no value....\u00a0...Therefore, this series is divergent....\u00a0...Just like with convergent series, adding/subtracting a   finite number from a divergent series is not going to change the divergence of the series....\u00a0...So, some general rules about the convergence/divergence of a series are now in order.\u00a0 Multiplying a series by a constant will not change the convergence/divergence of the series and adding or subtracting a constant from a series will not change the convergence/divergence of the series.\u00a0 These are nice ideas to keep in mind.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/Series_Special.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "The last topic that we discussed in the previous section was the harmonic series.\u00a0 In that discussion we stated that the harmonic series was a divergent series.\u00a0 It is now time to prove that statement.\u00a0 This proof will also get us started on the way to our next test for convergence that we\u2019ll be looking at....\u00a0...So, we will be trying to prove that the harmonic series,...diverges. ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll start this off by looking at an apparently unrelated problem.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off by asking what the area under ...\u00a0on the interval ....\u00a0 From the section on ... we know that this is,...and so we called this integral divergent (yes, that\u2019s the same term we\u2019re using here with series\u2026.)....\u00a0...So, just how does that help us to prove that the harmonic series diverges?\u00a0 Well, recall that we can always estimate the area by breaking up the interval into segments and then sketching in rectangles and using the sum of the area all of the rectangles as an estimate of the actual area.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do that for this problem as well and see what we get....\u00a0...We will break up the interval into subintervals of width 1 and we\u2019ll take the function value at the left endpoint as the height of the rectangle.\u00a0 The image below shows the first few rectangles for this area....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the area under the curve is approximately,...\u00a0...Now note a couple of things about this approximation.\u00a0 First, each of the rectangles overestimates the actual area and secondly the formula for the area is exactly the harmonic series!...\u00a0...Putting these two facts together gives the following,...\u00a0...Notice that this tells us that we must have,...\u00a0...Since we can\u2019t really be larger than infinity the harmonic series must also be infinite in value.\u00a0 In other words, the harmonic series is in fact divergent....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve managed to relate a series to an improper integral that we could compute and it turns out that the improper integral and the series have exactly the same convergence....\u00a0...Let\u2019s see if this will also be true for a series that converges.\u00a0 When discussing the ... we made the claim that...converges.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if we can do something similar to the above process to prove this....\u00a0...We will try to relate this to the area under ...\u00a0is on the interval ....\u00a0\u00a0 Again, from the ... section we know that,...and so this integral converges....\u00a0...We will once again try to estimate the area under this curve.\u00a0 We will do this in an almost identical manner as the previous part with the exception that instead of using the left end points for the height of our rectangles we will use the right end points.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of this case,...\u00a0...In this case the area estimation is,...\u00a0...This time, unlike the first case, the area will be an underestimation of the actual area and the estimation is not quite the series that we are working with.\u00a0 Notice however that the only difference is that we\u2019re missing the first term.\u00a0 This means we can do the following,...\u00a0...Or, putting all this together we see that,...\u00a0...With the harmonic series this was all that we needed to say that the series was divergent.\u00a0 With this series however, this isn\u2019t quite enough.\u00a0 For instance ...\u00a0and if the series did have a value of ...\u00a0then it would be divergent (when we want convergent).\u00a0 So, let\u2019s do a little more work....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s notice that all the series terms are positive (that\u2019s important) and that the partial sums are,...\u00a0...Because the terms are all positive we know that the partial sums must be an increasing sequence. In other words,...In ... we are adding a single positive term onto ... and so must get larger.\u00a0 Therefore, the partial sums form an increasing (and hence monotonic) sequence....\u00a0...Also note that, since the terms are all positive, we can say,...and so the sequence of partial sums is a bounded sequence....\u00a0...In the ... on Sequences we gave a theorem that stated that a bounded and monotonic sequence was guaranteed to be convergent.\u00a0 This means that the sequence of partial sums is a convergent sequence.\u00a0 So, who cares right?\u00a0 Well recall that this means that the series must then also be convergent!...\u00a0...So, once again we were able to relate a series to an improper integral (that we could compute) and the series and the integral had the same convergence....\u00a0...We went through a fair amount of work in both of these examples to determine the convergence of the two series.\u00a0 Luckily for us we don\u2019t need to do all this work every time.\u00a0 The ideas in these two examples can be summarized in the following test....\u00a0...Suppose that ...\u00a0is a continuous, positive and decreasing   function on the interval ...\u00a0and that ...\u00a0then,...\u00a0...A formal ... of this test can be found at the end of this section....\u00a0...There are a couple of things to note about the integral test.\u00a0 First, the lower limit on the improper integral must be the same value that starts the series.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Second, the function does not actually need to be decreasing and positive everywhere in the interval.\u00a0 All that\u2019s really required is that eventually the function is decreasing and positive.\u00a0 In other words, it is okay if the function (and hence series terms) increases or is negative for a while, but eventually the function (series terms) must decrease and be positive for all terms.\u00a0 To see why this is true let\u2019s suppose that the series terms increase and or are negative in the range ...\u00a0and then decrease and are positive for ....\u00a0 In this case the series can be written as,...\u00a0...Now, the first series is nothing more than a finite sum (no matter how large ... is) of finite terms and so will be finite.\u00a0 So the original series will be convergent/divergent only if the second infinite series on the right is convergent/divergent and the test can be done on the second series as it satisfies the conditions of the test....\u00a0...A similar argument can be made using the improper integral as well.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The requirement in the test that the function/series be decreasing and positive everywhere in the range is required for the proof.\u00a0 In practice however, we only need to make sure that the function/series is eventually a decreasing and positive function/series.\u00a0 Also note that when computing the integral in the test we don\u2019t actually need to strip out the increasing/negative portion since the presence of a small range on which the function is increasing/negative will not change the integral from convergent to divergent or from divergent to convergent....\u00a0...There is one more very important point that must be made about this test.\u00a0 This test does NOT give the value of a series.\u00a0 It will only give the convergence/divergence of the series.\u00a0 That\u2019s it.\u00a0 No value.\u00a0 We can use the above series as a perfect example of this.\u00a0 All that the test gave us was that,...\u00a0...So, we got an upper bound on the value of the series, but not an actual value for the series.\u00a0 In fact, from this point on we will not be asking for the value of a series we will only be asking whether a series converges or diverges.\u00a0 In a later ... we look at estimating values of series, but even in that section still won\u2019t actually be getting values of series....\u00a0...Just for the sake of completeness the value of this series is known....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....In this case the function we\u2019ll use is,...This function is clearly positive and if we make ... larger the denominator will get   larger and so the function is also decreasing.\u00a0 Therefore, all we need to do is determine   the convergence of the following integral....\u00a0...The integral is divergent and so the series is also   divergent by the Integral Test....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....The function that we\u2019ll use in this example is,...\u00a0...This function is always positive on the interval that   we\u2019re looking at.\u00a0 Now we need to check   that the function is decreasing.\u00a0 It is   not clear that this function will always be decreasing on the interval   given.\u00a0 We can use our Calculus I   knowledge to help us however.\u00a0 The   derivative of this function is,...\u00a0...This function has two critical points (which will tell us   where the derivative changes sign) at ....\u00a0 Since we are starting at ...\u00a0we can ignore the negative critical   point.\u00a0 Picking a couple of test points   we can see that the function is increasing on the interval ...\u00a0and it is decreasing on ....\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, eventually the function will be   decreasing and that\u2019s all that\u2019s required for us to use the Integral Test....\u00a0...\u00a0...The integral is convergent and so the series must also be   convergent by the Integral Test....\u00a0...We can use the Integral Test to get the following fact/test for some series....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0converges if ...\u00a0and diverges if .......\u00a0...Sometimes the series in this fact are called ...-series and so this fact is sometimes called the ...-series test.\u00a0 This fact follows directly from the Integral Test and a similar ... we saw in the Improper Integral section.\u00a0 This fact says that the integral,...converges if ...\u00a0and diverges if .......\u00a0...Using the ...-series test\u00a0 makes it very easy to determine the convergence of some series....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series are convergent or divergent.... In this   case ...\u00a0and so by this fact the series is   convergent....\u00a0... For this   series ...\u00a0and so the series is divergent by the fact....\u00a0...The last thing that we\u2019ll do in this section is give a quick proof of the Integral Test.\u00a0 We\u2019ve essentially done the proof already at the beginning of the section when we were introducing the Integral Test, but let\u2019s go through it formally for a general function....\u00a0...First, for the   sake of the proof we\u2019ll be working with the series ....\u00a0 The original test statement was for a   series that started at a general ...\u00a0and while the proof can be done for that it   will be easier if we assume that the series starts at ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Another way of   dealing with the ...\u00a0is we could do an ... and start the series at ...\u00a0and then do the Integral Test.\u00a0 Either way proving the test for ...\u00a0will be sufficient....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off   and estimate the area under the curve on the interval ...\u00a0and we\u2019ll underestimate the area by taking   rectangles of width one and whose height is the right endpoint.\u00a0 This gives the following figure....\u00a0...Now, note that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The approximate   area is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and we know   that this underestimates the actual area so,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s   suppose that ...\u00a0is convergent and so ...\u00a0must have a finite value.\u00a0 Also, because ...\u00a0is positive we know that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This in turn   means that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Our series   starts at ...\u00a0so this isn\u2019t quite what we need.\u00a0 However, that\u2019s easy enough to deal with....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, just what   has this told us?\u00a0 Well we now know   that the sequence of partial sums, ...\u00a0are bounded above by .......\u00a0...Next, because   the terms are positive we also know that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and so the   sequence ...\u00a0is also an increasing sequence.\u00a0 So, we now ... that the sequence of   partial sums ...\u00a0converges and hence our series ...\u00a0is convergent....\u00a0...So, the first   part of the test is proven.\u00a0 The second   part is somewhat easier.\u00a0 This time   let\u2019s overestimate the area under the curve by using the left endpoints of   interval for the height of the rectangles as shown below....\u00a0...In this case   the area is approximately,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Since we know   this overestimates the area we also then know that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, suppose   that ...\u00a0is divergent.\u00a0 In this case this means that ...\u00a0as ...\u00a0because ....\u00a0 However, because ...\u00a0as ...\u00a0we also know that\u00a0 .......\u00a0...Therefore,   since ...\u00a0we know that as ...\u00a0we must have ....\u00a0 This in turn tells us that ...\u00a0as .......\u00a0...So, we now know   that the sequence of partial sums, ...,   is a divergent sequence and so ...\u00a0is a divergent series....\u00a0...\u00a0...It is important to note before leaving this section that in order to use the Integral Test the series terms MUST eventually be decreasing and positive.\u00a0 If they are not then the test doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0 Also remember that the test only determines the convergence of a series and does NOT give the

positive in the range of ...\u00a0that we are working with.\u00a0 The surface integral is then,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget that we need to plug in for ..., ...   and/or ... in these as well, although   in this case we just needed to plug in ....\u00a0 Here is the evaluation for the double   integral....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the portion of the cylinder ...\u00a0that lies between ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...We parameterized up a cylinder in the previous ....\u00a0 Here is the parameterization of this   cylinder....The ranges of the parameters are,...\u00a0...Now we need ....\u00a0 Here are the two vectors....\u00a0...Here is the cross product....\u00a0...The magnitude of this vector is,...\u00a0...The surface integral is then,...\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the surface whose side is the cylinder ...,   whose bottom is the disk ...\u00a0in the ...-plane   and whose top is the plane .......\u00a0...There is a lot of information that we need to keep track   of here.\u00a0 First, we are using pretty   much the same surface (the integrand is different however) as the previous   example.\u00a0 However, unlike the previous   example we are putting a top and bottom on the surface this time.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first start out with a sketch of the   surface....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Actually we need to be careful here.\u00a0 There is more to this sketch than the   actual surface itself.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to   let ...\u00a0be the portion of the cylinder that goes   from the ...-plane to the   plane.\u00a0 In other words, the top of the   cylinder will be at an angle.\u00a0 We\u2019ll   call the portion of the plane that lies inside (... the cap on the cylinder) ....   \u00a0Finally, the bottom of the cylinder   (not shown here) is the disk of radius ...\u00a0in the ...-plane   and is denoted by .......\u00a0...In order to do this integral we\u2019ll need to note that just   like the standard double integral, if the surface is split up into pieces we   can also split up the surface integral.\u00a0   So, for our example we will have,...\u00a0...We\u2019re going to need to do three integrals here.\u00a0 However, we\u2019ve done most of the work for   the first one in the previous example so let\u2019s start with that....\u00a0...\u00a0: ...\u00a0...The parameterization of the cylinder and ...\u00a0is,...\u00a0...The difference between this problem and the previous one   is the limits on the parameters.\u00a0 Here   they are....\u00a0...The upper limit for the ...\u2019s is the plane so we can just plug that in.\u00a0 However, since we are on the cylinder we   know what ... is from the   parameterization so we will also need to plug that in....\u00a0...Here is the integral for the cylinder....\u00a0...\u00a0: ...\u00a0...In this case we don\u2019t need to do any parameterization   since it is set up to use the formula that we gave at the start of this   section.\u00a0 Remember that the plane is   given by ....\u00a0\u00a0 Also note that, for this surface, ... is the disk of radius ...\u00a0centered at the origin....\u00a0...Here is the integral for the plane....\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget that we need to plug in for ...!\u00a0   Now at this point we can proceed in one of two ways.\u00a0 Either we can proceed with the integral or   we can recall that ...\u00a0is nothing more than the area of ... and we know that ... is the disk of radius ...\u00a0and so there is no reason to do the   integral. ...\u00a0...Here is the remainder of the work for this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0: ...\u00a0...Again, this is set up to use the initial formula we gave   in this section once we realize that the equation for the bottom is given by ...\u00a0and ...   is the disk of radius ...\u00a0centered at the origin.\u00a0 Also, don\u2019t forget to plug in for .......\u00a0...Here is the work for this integral....\u00a0...We can now get the value of the integral

So, if we drop the ... from the denominator the denominator will get smaller and hence the whole fraction will get larger.\u00a0 So,...\u00a0...Now, ...is a ... and we know that since ...\u00a0the series will converge and its value will be,...\u00a0...Now, if we go back to our original series and write down the partial sums we get,...\u00a0...Since all the terms are positive adding a new term will only make the number larger and so the sequence of partial sums must be an increasing sequence....\u00a0...Then since,...and because the terms in these two sequences are positive we can also say that,...\u00a0...Therefore, the sequence of partial sums is also a bounded sequence.\u00a0 Then from the ... on sequences we know that a monotonic and bounded sequence is also convergent....\u00a0...So, the sequence of partial sums of our series is a convergent sequence.\u00a0 This means that the series itself,...is also convergent....\u00a0...So, what did we do here?\u00a0 We found a series whose terms were always larger than the original series terms and this new series was also convergent.\u00a0 Then since the original series terms were positive (very important) this meant that the original series was also convergent....\u00a0...To show that a series (with only positive terms) was divergent we could go through a similar argument and find a new divergent series whose terms are always smaller than the original series.\u00a0 In this case the original series would have to take a value larger than the new series.\u00a0 However, since the new series is divergent its value will be infinite.\u00a0 This means that the original series must also be infinite and hence divergent....\u00a0...We can summarize all this in the following test....\u00a0...Suppose that we have two series ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0with ...\u00a0for all ...   and ...\u00a0for all ....\u00a0 Then,...\u00a0...In other words, we have two series of positive terms and the terms of one of the series is always larger than the terms of the other series.\u00a0\u00a0 Then if the larger series is convergent the smaller series must also be convergent.\u00a0 Likewise, if the smaller series is divergent then the larger series must also be divergent.\u00a0 Note as well that in order to apply this test we need both series to start at the same place....\u00a0...A formal ... of this test is at the end of this section....\u00a0...Do not misuse this test.\u00a0 Just because the smaller of the two series converges does not say anything about the larger series.\u00a0 The larger series may still diverge.\u00a0 Likewise, just because we know that the larger of two series diverges we can\u2019t say that the smaller series will also diverge!\u00a0 Be very careful in using this test...\u00a0...Recall that we had a similar test for ... back when we were looking at integration techniques.\u00a0 So, if you could use the comparison test for improper integrals you can use the comparison test for series as they are pretty much the same idea....\u00a0...Note as well that the requirement that ...\u00a0\u00a0and ...\u00a0really only need to be true eventually.\u00a0 In other words, if a couple of the first terms are negative or ...\u00a0for a couple of the first few terms we\u2019re okay.\u00a0 As long as we eventually reach a point where ...\u00a0\u00a0and ...\u00a0for all sufficiently large ... the test will work.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To see why this is true let\u2019s suppose that the series start at ...\u00a0and that the conditions of the test are only true for for ...\u00a0and for ...\u00a0at least one of the conditions is not true.\u00a0 If we then look at ...\u00a0(the same thing could be done for ...) we get,...\u00a0...The first series is nothing more than a finite sum (no matter how large ... is) of finite terms and so will be finite.\u00a0 So the original series will be convergent/divergent only if the second infinite series on the right is convergent/divergent and the test can be done on the second series as it satisfies the conditions of the test....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....Since the cosine term in the denominator doesn\u2019t get too   large we can assume that the series terms will behave like,...which, as a series, will diverge.\u00a0 So, from this we can guess that the series   will probably diverge and so we\u2019ll need to find a smaller series that will   also diverge....\u00a0...Recall that from the comparison test with improper   integrals that we determined that we can make a fraction smaller by either   making the numerator smaller or the denominator larger.\u00a0 In this case the two terms in the   denominator are both positive. So, if we drop the cosine term we will in fact   be making the denominator larger since we will no longer be subtracting off a   positive quantity.\u00a0 Therefore,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Then, since ...diverges (it\u2019s harmonic or the ...-series test) by the Comparison Test our original series must   also diverge....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges....In this case the \u201c+2\u201d and the \u201c+5\u201d don\u2019t really add   anything to the series and so the series terms should behave pretty much like...which will converge as a series.\u00a0 Therefore, we can guess that the original   series will converge and we will need to find a larger series which also   converges....\u00a0...This means that we\u2019ll either have to make the numerator   larger or the denominator smaller.\u00a0 We   can make the denominator smaller by dropping the \u201c+5\u201d.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...At this point, notice that we can\u2019t drop the \u201c+2\u201d from the   numerator since this would make the term smaller and that\u2019s not what we   want.\u00a0 However, this is actually the furthest that we need to go.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   take a look at the following series....\u00a0...As shown, we can write the series as a sum of two series   and both of these series are convergent by the ...-series test.\u00a0 Therefore,   since each of these series are convergent we know that the sum,...is also a convergent series.\u00a0 Recall that the sum of two convergent   series will also be convergent....\u00a0...Now, since the terms of this series are larger than the   terms of the original series we know that the original series must also be   convergent by the Comparison Test....\u00a0...The comparison test is a nice test that allows us to do problems that either we couldn\u2019t have done with the integral test or at the best would have been very difficult to do with the integral test.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t have problems of its own....\u00a0...Consider the following series....\u00a0...This is not much different from the first series that we looked at.\u00a0 The original series converged because the ... gets very large very fast and will be significantly larger than the ....\u00a0 Therefore, the ... doesn\u2019t really affect the convergence of the series in that case.\u00a0 The fact that we are now subtracting the ... off instead of adding the ... on really shouldn\u2019t change the convergence.\u00a0 We can say this because the ... gets very large very fast and the fact that we\u2019re subtracting ... off won\u2019t really change the size of this term for all sufficiently large values of .......\u00a0...So, we would expect this series to converge.\u00a0 However, the comparison test won\u2019t work with this series.\u00a0 To use the comparison test on this series we would need to find a larger series that we could easily determine the convergence of.\u00a0 In this case we can\u2019t do what we did with the original series.\u00a0 If we drop the ... we will make the denominator larger (since the ... was subtracted off) and so the fraction will get smaller and just like when we looked at the comparison test for improper integrals knowing that the smaller of two series converges does not mean that the larger of the two will also converge....\u00a0...So, we will need something else to do help us determine the convergence of this series.\u00a0 The following variant of the comparison test will allow us to determine the convergence of this series....\u00a0...Suppose that we have two series ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0with ... ...\u00a0for all ....\u00a0 Define,...If ... is positive   (... ...) and is finite (... ...) then either both series converge or   both series diverge....\u00a0...The ... of this test is at the end of this section....\u00a0...Note that it doesn\u2019t really matter which series term is in the numerator for this test, we could just have easily defined ... as,...and we would get the same results.\u00a0 To see why this is, consider the following two definitions....\u00a0...Start with the first definition and rewrite it as follows, then take the limit....\u00a0...In other words, if ... is positive and finite then so is ...\u00a0and if ...\u00a0is positive and finite then so is ....\u00a0 Likewise if ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0and if ...\u00a0then ....\u00a0 Both definitions will give the same results from the test so don\u2019t worry about which series terms should be in the numerator and which should be in the denominator.\u00a0 Choose this to make the limit easy to compute....\u00a0...Also, this really is a comparison test in some ways.\u00a0 If ... is positive and finite this is saying that both of the series terms will behave in generally the same fashion and so we can expect the series themselves to also behave in a similar fashion.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0we can\u2019t say this and so the test fails to give any information. ...\u00a0...The limit in this test will often be written as,...since often both terms will be fractions and this will make the limit easier to deal with....\u00a0...Let\u2019s see how this test works....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges....To use the limit comparison test we need to find a second   series that we can determine the convergence of easily and has what we assume   is the same convergence as the given series.\u00a0   On top of that we will need to choose the new series in such a way as   to give us an easy limit to compute for .......\u00a0...We\u2019ve already guessed that this series converges and since   it\u2019s vaguely geometric let\u2019s use...as the second series.\u00a0   We know that this series converges and there is a chance that since   both series have the ...   in it the limit won\u2019t be too bad.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here\u2019s the limit....\u00a0...Now, we\u2019ll need to use L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule on the second   term in order to actually evaluate this limit....\u00a0...So, ... is   positive and finite so by the Comparison Test both series must converge since   ...converges....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges....Fractions involving only polynomials or polynomials under   radicals will behave in the same way as the largest power of ... will behave in the limit.\u00a0 So, the terms in this series should behave   as,...and as a series this will diverge by the ...-series test.\u00a0 In fact, this would make a nice choice for   our second series in the limit comparison test so let\u2019s use it....\u00a0...So, ... is   positive and finite and so both limits will diverge since...diverges....\u00a0...Finally, to see why we need ... to be positive and finite (... ...\u00a0and ...) consider the following two series....The first diverges and the second converges....\u00a0...Now compute each of the following limits....\u00a0...In the first case the limit from the limit comparison test yields ...\u00a0and in the second case the limit yields ....\u00a0 Clearly, both series do not have the same convergence....\u00a0...Note however, that just because we get ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean that the series will have the opposite convergence.\u00a0 To see this consider the series,...\u00a0...Both of these series converge and here are the two possible limits that the limit comparison test uses....\u00a0...So, even though both series had the same convergence we got both ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...The point of all of this is to remind us that if we get ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0from the limit comparison test we will know that we have chosen the second series incorrectly and we\u2019ll need to find a different choice in order to get any information about the convergence of the series....\u00a0...We\u2019ll close out this section with proofs of the two tests....\u00a0...The test   statement did not specify where each series should start.\u00a0 We only need to require that they start at   the same place so to help with the proof we\u2019ll assume that the series start   at ....\u00a0 If the series don\u2019t start at ...\u00a0the proof can be redone in exactly the same   manner or you could use an ...   to start the series at ...\u00a0and then this proof will apply....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start off   with the partial sums of each series....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s notice a   couple of nice facts about these two partial sums.\u00a0 First, because ...\u00a0we know that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, both   partial sums form increasing sequences....\u00a0...Also, because ...\u00a0for all ...   we know that we must have ...\u00a0for all .......\u00a0...With these   preliminary facts out of the way we can proceed with the proof of the test   itself....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start out   by assuming that ...\u00a0is a convergent series.\u00a0 Since ...\u00a0we know that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...However, we   also have established that ...\u00a0for all ...   and so for all ... we also have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally since ...\u00a0is a convergent series it must have a finite   value and so the partial sums, ...\u00a0are bounded above.\u00a0 Therefore, from the ... on sequences   we know that a monotonic and bounded sequence is also convergent and so ...\u00a0is a convergent sequence and so ...\u00a0is convergent....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s   assume that ...\u00a0is divergent.\u00a0 Because ...\u00a0we then know that we must have ...\u00a0as ....\u00a0 However, we also know that for all ... we have ...\u00a0and therefore we also know that ...\u00a0as ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is a divergent sequence and so ...\u00a0is divergent....\u00a0...\u00a0...Because ...\u00a0we can find two positive and finite numbers,   ... and ..., such that ....\u00a0 Now, because ...\u00a0we know that for large enough ... the quotient ...\u00a0must be close to ... and so there must be a positive integer ... such that if ...\u00a0we also

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Just as we did with line integrals we now need to move on to surface integrals of vector fields.\u00a0 Recall that in line integrals the orientation of the curve we were integrating along could change the answer.\u00a0 The same thing will hold true with surface integrals.\u00a0 So, before we really get into doing surface integrals of vector fields we first need to introduce the idea of an ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with a surface that has two sides (while this may seem strange, recall that the ... is a surface that only has one side!) that has a tangent plane at every point (except possibly along the boundary).\u00a0 Making this assumption means that every point will have two unit normal vectors, ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 This means that every surface will have two sets of normal vectors.\u00a0 The set that we choose will give the surface an orientation....\u00a0...There is one convention that we will make in regards to certain kinds of oriented surfaces.\u00a0 First we need to define a ....\u00a0 A surface ... is closed if it is the boundary of some solid region ....\u00a0 A good example of a closed surface is the surface of a sphere.\u00a0 We say that the closed surface ... has a ... orientation if we choose the set of unit normal vectors that point outward from the region ... while the ... orientation will be the set of unit normal vectors that point in towards the region .......\u00a0...Note that this convention is only used for closed surfaces....\u00a0...In order to work with surface integrals of vector fields we will need to be able to write down a formula for the unit normal vector corresponding to the orientation that we\u2019ve chosen to work with.\u00a0 We have two ways of doing this depending on how the surface has been given to us....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s suppose that the function is given by ....\u00a0 In this case we first define a new function,...In terms of our new function the surface is then given by the equation ....\u00a0 Now, ... that ...\u00a0will be orthogonal (or normal) to the surface given by\u00a0 ....\u00a0 This means that we have a normal vector to the surface.\u00a0 The only potential problem is that it might not be a unit normal vector.\u00a0 That isn\u2019t a problem since we also know that we can turn any vector into a unit vector by dividing the vector by its length.\u00a0 In our case this is,...\u00a0...In this case it will be convenient to actually compute the gradient vector and plug this into the formula for the normal vector.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Now, from a notational standpoint this might not have been so convenient, but it does allow us to make a couple of additional comments.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, notice that the component of the normal vector in the ...-direction (identified by the ...\u00a0in the normal vector) is always positive and so this normal vector will generally point upwards.\u00a0 It may not point directly up, but it will have an upwards component to it....\u00a0...This will be important when we are working with a closed surface and we want the positive orientation.\u00a0 If we know that we can then look at the normal vector and determine if the \u201cpositive\u201d orientation should point upwards or downwards.\u00a0 Remember that the \u201cpositive\u201d orientation must point out of the region and this may mean downwards in places.\u00a0 Of course if it turns out that we need the downward orientation we can always take the negative of this unit vector and we\u2019ll get the one that we need.\u00a0 Again, remember that we always have that option when choosing the unit normal vector....\u00a0...Before we move onto the second method of giving the surface we should point out that we only did this for surfaces in the form ....\u00a0 We could just as easily done the above work for surfaces in the form ...\u00a0(so ...) or for surfaces in the form ...\u00a0(so ...)....\u00a0...Now, we need to discuss how to find the unit normal vector if the surface is given parametrically as,...In this case ... that the vector ...\u00a0will be normal to the tangent plane at a particular point.\u00a0 But if the vector is normal to the tangent plane at a point then it will also be normal to the surface at that point.\u00a0 So, this is a normal vector.\u00a0 In order to guarantee that it is a unit normal vector we will also need to divide it by its magnitude.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in the case of parametric surfaces one of the unit normal vectors will be,...\u00a0...As with the first case we will need to look at this once it\u2019s computed and determine if it points in the correct direction or not.\u00a0 If it doesn\u2019t then we can always take the negative of this vector and that will point in the correct direction....\u00a0...Finally, remember that we can always parameterize any surface given by ...\u00a0(or ...\u00a0or ...) easily enough and so if we want to we can always use the parameterization formula to find the unit normal vector....\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve looked at oriented surfaces and their associated unit normal vectors we can actually give a formula for evaluating surface integrals of vector fields....\u00a0...Given a vector field ...\u00a0with unit normal vector ...\u00a0then the surface integral of ...\u00a0over the surface ... is given by,...\u00a0...where the right hand integral is a standard surface integral.\u00a0 This is sometimes called the ...\u00a0.......\u00a0...Before we work any examples let\u2019s notice that we can substitute in for the unit normal vector to get a ... easier formula to use.\u00a0 We will need to be careful with each of the following formulas however as each will assume a certain orientation and we may have to change the normal vector to match the given orientation....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first start by assuming that the surface is given by ....\u00a0 In this case let\u2019s also assume that the vector field is given by ...\u00a0and that the orientation that we are after is the \u201cupwards\u201d orientation.\u00a0 Under all of these assumptions the surface integral of ...\u00a0over ... is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, remember that this assumed the \u201cupward\u201d orientation.\u00a0 If we\u2019d needed the \u201cdownward\u201d orientation then we would need to change the signs on the normal vector.\u00a0 This would in turn change the signs on the integrand as well.\u00a0 So, we really need to be careful here when using this formula.\u00a0 In general it is best to rederive this formula as you need it....\u00a0...When we\u2019ve been given a surface that is not in parametric form there are in fact 6 possible integrals here.\u00a0 Two for each form of the surface ..., ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Given each form of the surface there will be two possible unit normal vectors and we\u2019ll need to choose the correct one to match the given orientation of the surface.\u00a0 However, the derivation of each formula is similar to that given here and so shouldn\u2019t be too bad to do as you need to....\u00a0...Notice as well that because we are using the unit normal vector the messy square root will always drop out.\u00a0 This means that when we do need to derive the formula we won\u2019t really need to put this in.\u00a0 All we\u2019ll need to work with is the numerator of the unit vector.\u00a0 We will see at least one more of these derived in the examples below.\u00a0 It should also be noted that the square root is nothing more than,...so in the following work we will probably just use this notation in place of the square root when we can to make things a little simpler....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a quick look at the formula for the surface integral when the surface is given parametrically by ....\u00a0 In this case the surface integral is,...\u00a0...Again note that we may have to change the sign on ...\u00a0to match the orientation of the surface and so there is once again really two formulas here.\u00a0 Also note that again the magnitude cancels in this case and so we won\u2019t need to worry that in these problems either....\u00a0...Note as well that there are even times when we will used the definition, ..., directly.\u00a0 We will see an example of this below....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now work a couple of examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...\u00a0and ...   is the surface given by the paraboloid ...,   ...\u00a0and the disk ...\u00a0at ....\u00a0 Assume that ... has positive orientation....\u00a0...Okay, first let\u2019s notice that the disk is really nothing   more than the cap on the paraboloid.\u00a0   This means that we have a closed surface.\u00a0 This is important because we\u2019ve been told   that the surface has a positive orientation and by convention this means that   all the unit normal vectors will need to point outwards from the region   enclosed by ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s first get a sketch of ... so we can get a feel for what is going on and in which   direction we will need to unit normal vectors to point....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As noted in the sketch we will denote the paraboloid by ...\u00a0and the disk by ....\u00a0 Also note that in order for unit normal   vectors on the paraboloid to point away from the region they will all need to   point generally in the negative ...   direction.\u00a0 On the other hand, unit   normal vectors on the disk will need to point in the positive ... direction in order to point away   from the region....\u00a0...Since ... is   composed of the two surfaces we\u2019ll need to do the surface integral on each   and then add the results to get the overall surface integral.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the paraboloid.\u00a0 In this case we have the surface in the   form ...\u00a0so we will need to derive the correct   formula since the one given initially wasn\u2019t for this kind of function.\u00a0 This is easy enough to do however.\u00a0 First define,...\u00a0...We will next need the gradient vector of this function....\u00a0...Now, the ...   component of the gradient is positive and so this vector will generally point   in the positive ... direction.\u00a0 However, as noted above we need the normal   vector point in the negative ...   direction to make sure that it will be pointing away from the enclosed   region.\u00a0 This means that we will need   to use...\u00a0...Let\u2019s note a couple of things here before we proceed.\u00a0 We don\u2019t really need to divide this by the   magnitude of the gradient since this will just cancel out once we actually do   the integral.\u00a0 So, because of this we   didn\u2019t bother computing it.\u00a0 Also, the   dropping of the minus sign is not a typo.\u00a0   When we compute the magnitude we are going to square each of the   components and so the minus sign will drop out....\u00a0...\u00a0: ...\u00a0...Okay, here is the surface integral in this case....\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget that we need to plug in the equation of the   surface for ... before we actually   compute the integral.\u00a0 In this case ... is the disk of radius 1 in the ...-plane and so it makes sense to use   polar coordinates to complete this integral.\u00a0   Here are polar coordinates for this region....\u00a0...Note that we kept the ...   conversion formula the same as the one we are used to using for ... and let ... be the formula that used the sine.\u00a0 We could have done it any order, however in   this way we are at least working with one of them as we are used to working   with....\u00a0...Here is the evaluation of this integral....\u00a0...\u00a0: ...\u00a0...We can now do the surface integral on the disk (cap on the   paraboloid).\u00a0 This one is actually   fairly easy to do and in fact we can use the definition of the surface   integral directly.\u00a0 First let\u2019s notice   that the disk is really just the portion of the plane ...\u00a0that is in front of the disk of radius 1 in   the ...-plane.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now we want the unit normal vector to point away from the   enclosed region and since it must also be orthogonal to the plane ...\u00a0then it must point in a direction that is   parallel to the ...-axis, but we   already have a unit vector that does this.\u00a0   Namely,...the standard unit basis vector.\u00a0 It also points in the correct direction for   us to use.\u00a0 Because we have the vector   field and the normal vector we can plug directly into the definition of the   surface integral to get,...\u00a0...At this point we need to plug in for ... (since ...is a portion of the plane ...\u00a0we do know what it is) and we\u2019ll also need   the square root this time when we convert the surface integral over to a   double integral.\u00a0 In this case since we   are using the definition directly we won\u2019t get the canceling of the square   root that we saw with the first portion.\u00a0   To get the square root well need to acknowledge that ...and so the square root is,...The surface integral is then,...\u00a0...At this point we can acknowledge that ... is a disk of radius 1 and this double integral is nothing more   than the double integral that will give the area of the region ... so there is no reason to compute the   integral.\u00a0 Here is the value of the   surface integral....\u00a0...Finally, to finish this off we just need to add the two   parts up.\u00a0 Here is the surface integral   that we were actually asked to compute....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...\u00a0and ...   is the upper half the sphere ...\u00a0and the disk ...\u00a0in the plane ....\u00a0 Assume that ... has the positive orientation....\u00a0...So, as with the previous problem we have a closed surface   and since we are also told that the surface has a positive orientation all   the unit normal vectors must point away from the enclosed region.\u00a0 To help us visualize this here is a sketch   of the surface....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will call ...\u00a0the hemisphere and ...\u00a0will be the bottom of the hemisphere (which   isn\u2019t shown on the sketch).\u00a0 Now, in   order for the unit normal vectors on the sphere to point away from enclosed   region they will all need to have a positive ... component.\u00a0 Remember that   the vector must be normal to the surface and if there is a positive ... component and the vector is normal   it will have to be pointing away from the enclosed region....\u00a0...On the other hand, the unit normal on the bottom of the   disk must point in the negative ...   direction in order to point away from the enclosed region....\u00a0...\u00a0: ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s do the surface integral on ...\u00a0first.\u00a0   In this case since the surface is a sphere we will need to use the   parametric representation of the surface.\u00a0   This is,...\u00a0...Since we are working on the hemisphere here are the limits   on the parameters that we\u2019ll need to use....Next, we need to determine ....\u00a0 Here are the two individual vectors and the   cross product....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that we won\u2019t need the magnitude of the cross product   since that will cancel out once we start doing the integral.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that for the range of ...\u00a0that we\u2019ve got both sine and cosine are   positive and so this vector will have a negative ... component and as we noted above in order for this to point away   from the enclosed area we will need the ...   component to be positive.\u00a0 Therefore we   will need to use the following vector for the unit normal vector....Again, we will drop the magnitude once we get to actually   doing the integral since it will just cancel in the integral....\u00a0...Okay, next we\u2019ll need...Remember that in this evaluation we are just plugging in   the ... component of ...\u00a0into the vector field .......\u00a0...We also may as well get the dot product out of the way   that we know we are going to need....\u00a0...Now we can do the integral....\u00a0...\u00a0: ...\u00a0...Now, we need to do the integral over the bottom of the   hemisphere.\u00a0 In this case we are   looking at the disk ...\u00a0that lies in the plane ...\u00a0and so the equation of this surface is actually   ....\u00a0 The disk is really the region ... that tells us how much of the   surface we are going to use.\u00a0 This also   means that we can use the definition of the surface integral here with ...\u00a0...We need the negative since it must point away from the   enclosed region....\u00a0...The surface integral in this case is,...\u00a0...Remember, however, that we are in the plane given by ...\u00a0and so the surface integral becomes,...\u00a0...The last step is to then add the two pieces up.\u00a0 Here is surface integral that we were asked   to look at....\u00a0...We will leave this section with a quick interpretation of a surface integral over a vector field.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0is the velocity field of a fluid then the surface integral...represents the volume of fluid flowing through ... per time unit (... per second, per minute, or whatever time unit you are using).", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/SurfIntVectorField.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus III - Surface Integrals of Vector Fields", "subject": "math"}},

surfaces....The   elliptic paraboloid ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...The   elliptic paraboloid ...\u00a0that is in front of the ...-plane.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...The   sphere

can quickly write down a set of   parametric equations as follows,...\u00a0...The last two equations are just there to acknowledge that   we can choose ... and ... to be anything we want them to   be.\u00a0 The parametric representation is   then,...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This is really a restriction on the previous parametric   representation.\u00a0 The parametric   representation stays the

one can be a little tricky until you see how to do   it.\u00a0 In spherical coordinates we know   that the equation of a sphere of radius ...   is given by,...and so the equation of this sphere (in spherical   coordinates) is ....\u00a0 Now, we also have the following conversion   formulas for converting Cartesian coordinates into spherical coordinates....\u00a0...However, we know what

be tricky until you see how   to do it.\u00a0 In this case it makes some sense   to use cylindrical coordinates since they can be easily used to write down   the equation of a cylinder....\u00a0...In

functions that are in this basic form....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Okay, now that we have practice writing down some parametric representations for some surfaces let\u2019s take a quick look at a couple of applications....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at finding the tangent plane to the parametric surface ... given by,...\u00a0...First, define...\u00a0...Now, provided ...\u00a0it can be shown that

an important idea that will be used many times throughout the next couple of sections....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Find   the equation of the tangent plane to the surface given by...at the point .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s first compute ....\u00a0 Here are the two individual vectors....\u00a0...Now the cross product (which will give us the normal   vector ...)

the individual components of the parametric representation equal to   the coordinates of the point in question.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Now, as shown, we have the value of ..., but there are two possible values of ....\u00a0 To determine the   correct value of ... let\u2019s plug ... into the third equation and solve   for ....\u00a0 This should tell us what the correct value   is....\u00a0...Okay so we now know that we\u2019ll be at the point in question   when ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 At this point the normal vector is,...The tangent plane is then,...\u00a0...You do ... how to   write down the equation of a plane, right?...\u00a0...The second application that we want to take a quick look at is the surface area of the parametric surface ... given by,...and as we will see it again comes down to needing the vector .......\u00a0...So, provided ... is traced out exactly once as ...\u00a0ranges over the points in ... the surface area of ... is given

...-plane....\u00a0...Okay we\u2019ve got a couple of things to do here.\u00a0 First we need the parameterization of the   sphere.\u00a0 We parameterized a sphere   earlier in this section so there isn\u2019t too much to do at this point.\u00a0 Here is the parameterization....\u00a0...Next we need to determine ....\u00a0 Since we are not   restricting how far around the ...-axis   we are rotating with the sphere we can take the following range for .......\u00a0...Now, we need to determine a range for ....\u00a0 This will take a little work, although it\u2019s   not too bad.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s start with the   equation of the sphere....Now, if we substitute the equation for the cylinder into   this equation we can find the value of ...   where the sphere and the cylinder

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to investigate the relationship between certain kinds of line integrals (on closed paths) and double integrals....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with a simple (... that this means that it doesn\u2019t cross itself) ... curve ... and let ... be the region enclosed by the curve.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of such a curve and region....First, notice that because the curve is simple and closed there are no holes in the region ....\u00a0 Also notice that a direction has been put on the curve.\u00a0 We will use the convention here that the curve ... has a ... if it is traced out in a counter-clockwise direction.\u00a0 Another way to think of a positive orientation (that will cover much more general curves as well see later) is that as we traverse the path following the positive orientation the region ... must always be on the left....\u00a0...Given curves/regions such as this we have the following theorem....\u00a0...Let ... be a   positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple, closed curve and let ... be the region enclosed by the   curve.\u00a0 If ... and ... have continuous   first order partial derivatives on ...   then,...\u00a0...Before working some examples there are some alternate notations that we need to acknowledge.\u00a0 When working with a line integral in which the

can identify ...   and ... from the line integral.\u00a0 Here they are....\u00a0...So, using Green\u2019s Theorem the line integral becomes,...\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the positively oriented circle of radius 2 centered at the origin....\u00a0...Okay, a circle will satisfy the conditions of Green\u2019s   Theorem since it is closed and simple and so there really isn\u2019t a reason to   sketch it....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first identify ...   and ... from the line integral....\u00a0...Be careful with the minus sign on ...!...\u00a0...Now, using Green\u2019s theorem on the line integral gives,...where ... is a   disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Since ... is a   disk it seems like the best way to do this integral is to use polar   coordinates.\u00a0 Here is the evaluation of   the integral....\u00a0...So, Green\u2019s theorem, as stated, will not work on regions that have holes in them.\u00a0 However, many regions do have holes in them.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s see how we can deal with those kinds of regions....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the following region.\u00a0 Even though this region doesn\u2019t have any holes in it the arguments that we\u2019re going to go through will be similar to those that we\u2019d need for regions with holes in them, except it will be a little easier to deal with and write down....The region ... will be ...\u00a0and recall that the symbol ...\u00a0is called the union and means that ... consists of both ... and ....\u00a0 The boundary of ... is ...\u00a0while the boundary of ... is ...\u00a0and notice that both of these boundaries are positively oriented.\u00a0 As we traverse each boundary the corresponding region is always on the left.\u00a0 Finally, also note that we can think of the whole boundary, ..., as,...since both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will \u201ccancel\u201d each other out....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s start with the following double integral and use a basic property of double integrals to break it up....\u00a0...Next, use Green\u2019s theorem on each of these and again use the fact that we can break up line integrals into separate line integrals for each portion of the boundary....\u00a0...Next, we\u2019ll use the fact that,...\u00a0...Recall that changing the orientation of a curve with line integrals with respect to ... and/or ... will simply change the sign on the integral.\u00a0 Using this fact we get,...\u00a0...Finally, put the line integrals back together and we get,...\u00a0...So, what did we learn from this?\u00a0 If you think about it this was just a lot of work and all we got out of it was the result from Green\u2019s Theorem which we already knew to be true.\u00a0 What this exercise has shown us is that if we break a region up as we did above then the portion of the line integral on the pieces of the curve that are in the middle of the region (each of which are in the opposite direction) will cancel out.\u00a0 This idea will help us in dealing with regions that have holes in them....\u00a0...To see this let\u2019s look at a ring....\u00a0...Notice that both of the curves are oriented positively since the region ... is on the left side as we traverse the curve in the indicated direction.\u00a0 Note as well that the curve ... seems to violate the original definition of positive orientation.\u00a0 We originally said that a curve had a positive orientation if it was traversed in a counter-clockwise direction.\u00a0 However, this was only for regions that do not have holes.\u00a0 For the boundary of the hole this definition won\u2019t work and we need to resort to the second definition that we gave above....\u00a0...Now, since this region has a hole in it we will apparently not be able to use Green\u2019s Theorem on any line integral with the curve ....\u00a0 However, if we cut the disk in half and rename all the various portions of the curves we get the following sketch....\u00a0...\u00a0...The boundary of the upper portion (...)of the disk is ...\u00a0and the boundary on the lower portion (...)of the disk is ....\u00a0 Also notice that we can use Green\u2019s Theorem on each of these new regions since they don\u2019t have any holes in them.\u00a0 This means that we can do the following,...\u00a0...Now, we can break up the line integrals into line integrals on each piece of the boundary.\u00a0 Also recall from the work above that boundaries that have the same curve, but opposite direction will cancel.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...But at this point we can add the line integrals back up as follows,...\u00a0...The end result of all of this is that we could have just used Green\u2019s Theorem on the disk from the start even though there is a hole in it.\u00a0 This will be true in general for regions that have holes in them....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   are the two circles of radius 2 and radius 1 centered at the origin with positive orientation....\u00a0...Notice that this is the same line integral as we looked at   in the second example and only the curve has changed.\u00a0 In this case the region ... will now be the region between these   two circles and that will only change the limits in the double integral so   we\u2019ll not put in some of the details here....\u00a0...Here is the work for this integral....\u00a0...We will close out this section with an interesting application of Green\u2019s Theorem.\u00a0 Recall that we can determine the area of a region ... with the following double integral....\u00a0...Let\u2019s think of this double integral as the result of using Green\u2019s Theorem.\u00a0 In other words, let\u2019s assume that...and see if we can get some functions ... and ... that will satisfy this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are many functions that will satisfy this.\u00a0 Here are some of the more common functions....\u00a0...Then, if we use Green\u2019s Theorem in reverse we see that the area of the region ... can also be computed by evaluating any of the following line integrals....\u00a0...where ... is the boundary of the region .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example of this....\u00a0...Use   Green\u2019s Theorem to find the area of a disk of radius .......\u00a0...We can use either of the integrals above, but the third   one is probably the easiest.\u00a0 So,...where ... is the   circle of radius ....\u00a0 So, to do this we\u2019ll need a   parameterization of ....\u00a0 This is,...\u00a0...The area

(including the ...) with respect to ... and set it equal to ... since that is what the derivative is   supposed to be....\u00a0...From this we can see that,...Notice that since ...\u00a0is a function only of ... so if there are any ...\u2019s   in the equation at this point we will know that we\u2019ve made a mistake.\u00a0 At this point finding ...\u00a0is simple....\u00a0...So, putting this all together we can see that a potential   function for the vector field is,...\u00a0...Note that we can always check our work by verifying that ....\u00a0 Also note that because the ... can be anything there are an   infinite number of possible potential functions, although they will only vary   by an additive constant....\u00a0... ...Okay, this one will go a lot faster since we don\u2019t need to   go through as much explanation.\u00a0 We\u2019ve   already verified that this vector field is conservative in the first set of   examples so we won\u2019t bother redoing that....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the following,...This means that we can do either of the following   integrals,...\u00a0...While we can do either of these the first integral would   be somewhat unpleasant as we would need to do integration by parts on each   portion.\u00a0 On the other hand the second   integral is fairly simple since the second term only involves ...\u2019s and the first term can be done   with the substitution ....\u00a0 So, from the second integral we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that this time the \u201cconstant of integration\u201d will   be a function of ....\u00a0 If we differentiate this with respect to ... and set equal to ... we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this case it looks like,...\u00a0...So, in this case the \u201cconstant of integration\u201d really was   a constant.\u00a0 Sometimes this will happen   and sometimes it won\u2019t....\u00a0...Here is the potential function for this vector field....\u00a0...Now, as noted above we don\u2019t have a way (yet) of determining if a three-dimensional vector field is conservative or not.\u00a0 However, if we are given that a three-dimensional vector field is conservative finding a potential function is similar to the above process, although the work will be a little more involved....\u00a0...In this case we will use the fact that,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example....\u00a0...Find   a potential function for the vector field,...\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ll start off with the following equalities....\u00a0...To get started we can integrate the first one with respect   to ..., the second one with respect   to ..., or the third one with respect   to ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s integrate the first one with respect   to .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that this time the \u201cconstant of integration\u201d will be   a function of both ... and ... since differentiating anything of   that form with respect to ... will   differentiate to zero....\u00a0...Now, we can differentiate this with respect to ... and set it equal to ....\u00a0   Doing this gives,...Of course we\u2019ll need to take the partial derivative of the   constant of integration since it is a function of two variables.\u00a0 It looks like we\u2019ve now got the following,...Since differentiating ...\u00a0with respect to ... gives zero then ...\u00a0could at most be a function of ....\u00a0   This means that we now know the potential function must be in the   following form....\u00a0...\u00a0...To finish this out all we need to do is differentiate with   respect to ... and set the result   equal to .......\u00a0...\u00a0...So,...\u00a0...The potential function for this vector field is then,...\u00a0...Note that to keep the work to a minimum we used a fairly simple potential function for this example.\u00a0 It might have been possible to guess what the potential function was based simply on the vector field.\u00a0 However, we should be careful to remember that this usually won\u2019t be the case and often this process is required....\u00a0...Also, there were several other paths that we could have taken to find the potential function.\u00a0 Each would have gotten us the same result.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one more slightly (and only slightly) more complicated example....\u00a0...Find   a potential function for the vector field,...\u00a0...Here are the equalities for this vector field....\u00a0...For this example let\u2019s integrate the third one with   respect to .......\u00a0...The \u201cconstant of integration\u201d for this integration will be   a function of both ... and .......\u00a0...Now, we can differentiate this with respect to ... and set it equal to ....\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve now got the following,...\u00a0...The potential function for this problem is then,...\u00a0...To finish this out all we need to do is differentiate with   respect to ... and set the result   equal to .......\u00a0...So,...\u00a0...The potential function for this vector field is then,...\u00a0...So, a little more complicated than the others and there are again many different paths that we could have taken to get the answer....\u00a0...We need to work one final example in this section....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...\u00a0and ...   is given by ...,   .......Now, we could use the techniques we discussed when we   first looked at ... however that would be particularly unpleasant solution....\u00a0...Instead, let\u2019s take advantage of the fact that we know   from Example 2a above this vector field is conservative and that a potential   function for the vector field is,...\u00a0...Using this we know that integral must be independent of   path and so all we need to do is use the theorem from the previous ... to do the evaluation....\u00a0...where,...\u00a0...So, the integral is,", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/ConservativeVectorField.aspx",

(defined shortly) and is given by the parametric equations,...We will often want to write the parameterization of the curve as a vector function.\u00a0 In this case the curve is given by,

seen the notation ... before.\u00a0 If you recall from Calculus II when we looked at the ... of a curve given by parametric equations we found it to be,...\u00a0...It is no coincidence that we use ... for both of these problems.\u00a0 The ... is the same for both the arc length integral and the notation for the line integral....\u00a0...So, to compute a line integral we will convert everything over to the parametric equations.\u00a0 The line integral is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget to plug the parametric equations into the function as well....\u00a0...If we use the vector form of the parameterization we can simplify the notation up somewhat by noticing that,...where ...\u00a0is the ... or norm of ....\u00a0 Using this notation the line integral becomes,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that as long as the parameterization of the curve ... is traced out exactly once as ... increases from ... to ... the value of the line integral will be independent of the parameterization of the curve....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example of a line integral....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the right half of the circle, .... rotated in the counter clockwise direction....We first need a parameterization of the circle.\u00a0 This is given by,...We now need a range of ...\u2019s   that will give the right half of the circle.\u00a0   The following range of ...\u2019s   will do this....\u00a0...Now, we need the derivatives of the parametric equations   and let\u2019s compute .......\u00a0...The line integral is

...\u00a0where the end point of ...\u00a0is the starting point of ....\u00a0 Below is an illustration of a piecewise smooth curve....\u00a0...\u00a0...Evaluation of line integrals over piecewise smooth curves is a relatively simple thing to do.\u00a0 All we do is evaluate the line integral over each of the pieces and then add them up.\u00a0 The line integral for some function over the above piecewise curve would be,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s see an example of this....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the curve shown below....\u00a0...So, first we need to parameterize each of the curves....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s do the line integral over each of these curves....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Finally, the line integral that we were asked to compute   is,...\u00a0...Notice that we put direction arrows on the curve in the above example.\u00a0 The direction of motion along a curve ... change the value of the line integral as we will see in the next section.\u00a0 Also note that the curve can be thought of a curve that takes us from the point ...\u00a0to the point ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s first see what happens to the line integral if we change the path between these two points....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the line segment from ...\u00a0to .......\u00a0...From the parameterization formulas at the start of this   section we know that the line segment starting at ...\u00a0and ending at ...\u00a0is given by,...for ....\u00a0 This means that the individual parametric   equations are,...\u00a0...Using this path the line integral is,...\u00a0...When doing these integrals don\u2019t forget simple Calc I   substitutions to avoid having to do things like cubing out a term.\u00a0 Cubing it out is not that difficult, but it is   more work than a simple substitution....\u00a0...So, the previous two examples seem to suggest that if we change the path between two points then the value of the line integral (with respect to arc length) will change.\u00a0 While this will happen fairly regularly we can\u2019t assume that it will always happen.\u00a0 In a later section we will investigate this idea in more detail....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s see what happens if we change the direction of a path....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the line segment from ...\u00a0to .......\u00a0...This one isn\u2019t much different, work wise, from the   previous example.\u00a0 Here is the   parameterization of the curve....for ....\u00a0 Remember that we are switching the direction   of the curve and this will also change the parameterization so we can make   sure that we start/end at the proper point....\u00a0...Here is the line integral....\u00a0...So, it looks like when we switch the direction of the curve the line integral (with respect to arc length) will not change.\u00a0 This will always be true for these kinds of line integrals.\u00a0 However, there are other kinds of line integrals in which this won\u2019t be the case.\u00a0 We will see more examples of this in the next couple of sections so don\u2019t get it into your head that changing the direction will never change the value of the line integral....\u00a0...Before working another example let\u2019s formalize this idea up somewhat.\u00a0 Let\u2019s suppose that the curve ... has the parameterization ..., ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s also suppose that the initial point on the curve is ... and the final point on the curve is .... The parameterization ..., ...\u00a0will then determine an ... for the curve where the positive direction is the direction that is traced out as ... increases.\u00a0 Finally, let ...\u00a0be the curve with the same points as ..., however in this case the curve has ... as the initial point and ... as the final point, again ... is increasing as we traverse this curve.\u00a0 In other words, given a curve ..., the curve ...\u00a0is the same curve as ... except the direction has been reversed....\u00a0...We then have the following fact about line integrals with respect to arc length....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, for a line integral with respect to arc length we can change the direction of the curve and not change the value of the integral.\u00a0 This is a useful fact to remember as some line integrals will be easier in one direction than the other....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s work another example...\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0for each of the following curves....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...:   The line segment from ...\u00a0to ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...:   The line segment from ...\u00a0to ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before working any of these line integrals let\u2019s notice   that all of these curves are paths that connect the points ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Also notice that ...\u00a0and so by the fact above these two should   give the same answer....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the three curves and note that the   curves illustrating ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0have been separated a little to show that   they are separate curves in some way even though they are the same line....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Here is a parameterization for this curve....\u00a0...Here is the line integral....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...There are two parameterizations that we could use here for   this curve.\u00a0 The first is to use the   formula we used in the previous couple of examples.\u00a0 That parameterization is,...for ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Sometimes we have no choice but to use this   parameterization.\u00a0 However, in this   case there is a second (probably) easier parameterization.\u00a0 The second one uses the fact that we are   really just graphing a portion of the line ....\u00a0 Using this the parameterization is,...\u00a0...This will be a much easier parameterization to use so we   will use this.\u00a0 Here is the line   integral for this curve....\u00a0...Note that this time, unlike the line integral we worked   with in Examples 2, 3, and 4 we got the same value for the integral despite   the fact that the path is different.\u00a0   This will happen on occasion.\u00a0   We should also not expect this integral to be the same for all paths   between these two points.\u00a0 At this point   all we know is that for these two paths the line integral will have the same   value.\u00a0 It is completely possible that   there is another path between these two points that will give a different   value for the line integral....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Now, according to our fact above we really don\u2019t need to   do anything here since we know that ....\u00a0 The fact tells us that this line integral   should be the same as the second part (...   zero).\u00a0 However, let\u2019s verify that,   plus there is a point we need to make here about the parameterization....\u00a0...Here is the parameterization for this curve....for ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that this time we can\u2019t use the second   parameterization that we used in part (b) since we need to move from right to   left as the parameter increases and the second parameterization used in the   previous part will move in the opposite direction....\u00a0...Here is the line integral for this curve....\u00a0...Sure enough we got the same answer as the second part....\u00a0...To this point in this section we\u2019ve only looked at line integrals over a two-dimensional curve.\u00a0 However, there is no reason to restrict ourselves like that.\u00a0 We can do line integrals over three-dimensional curves as well....\u00a0...Let\u2019s suppose that the three-dimensional curve ... is given by the parameterization,...then the line integral is given by,...\u00a0...Note that often when dealing with three-dimensional space the parameterization will be given as a vector function....\u00a0...Notice that we changed up the notation for the parameterization a little.\u00a0 Since we rarely use the function names we simply kept the ..., ..., and ... and added on the ...\u00a0part to denote that they may be functions of the parameter.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also notice that, as with two-dimensional curves, we have,...and the line integral can again be written as,...So, outside of the addition of a third parametric equation line integrals in three-dimensional space work the same as those in two-dimensional space.\u00a0 Let\u2019s work a quick example....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the helix given by, ...,

integration and if the outer differential is ... then the limits on the outer integral must be ... limits of integration....\u00a0...Now, on some level this is just notation and doesn\u2019t really

integration.\u00a0 To prove that let\u2019s work   this one with each order to make sure that we do get the same answer....\u00a0...In this case we will integrate with respect to ... first.\u00a0 So, the iterated integral that we need to   compute is,...\u00a0...When setting these up make sure the limits match up to the   differentials.\u00a0 Since the ... is the inner differential (... we are

make sure that you think about which one you should do first before actually doing the integral....\u00a0...The next topic of this section is a quick fact that can be used to make some iterated

any....\u00a0...What we want to do is discuss single indefinite integrals of a function of two variables.\u00a0 In other words we want to look at integrals like the following....\u00a0...\u00a0...From Calculus I we know that these integrals are asking what function that we differentiated to get the integrand.\u00a0 However, in this case we need to pay attention to the differential (... or ...) in the integral, because that will change things a little.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the case of the first integral we are asking what function we differentiated with respect to ... to get the integrand while in the second integral we\u2019re asking what function differentiated with respect to ... to get the integrand.\u00a0 For the most part answering these questions isn\u2019t that difficult.\u00a0 The important issue is how we deal with the constant of integration....\u00a0...Here are the integrals....\u00a0...Notice that the \u201cconstants\u201d of integration are now functions of the opposite variable.\u00a0 In the first integral we are differentiating with respect to ... and we know that any function involving only ...\u2019s will differentiate to zero and so when integrating with respect

integrals to polar coordinates and when we converted triple integrals to cylindrical or spherical coordinates.\u00a0 The main difference is that we didn\u2019t actually go through the details of where the formulas came from.\u00a0 If you recall, in each of those cases we commented that we would justify the formulas for ... and ... eventually.\u00a0 Now is the time to do that justification....\u00a0...While often the reason for changing variables is to get us an integral that we can do with the new variables, another reason for changing variables is to convert the region into a nicer region to work with.\u00a0 When we were converting the polar, cylindrical or spherical coordinates we didn\u2019t worry about this change since it was easy enough to determine the new limits based on the given region.\u00a0 That is not always the case however.\u00a0 So, before we move into changing variables with multiple integrals we first need to see how the region may change with a change of variables. ...\u00a0...First we need a little notation out of the way.\u00a0 We call the equations that define the change of variables a ....\u00a0 Also we will typically start out

much to do with this one other than   to plug the transformation into the equation for the ellipse and see what we   get....\u00a0...So, we started out with an ellipse and after the   transformation we had a disk of radius 2....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...As with the first part we\u2019ll need to plug the   transformation into the equation, however, in this case we will need to do it   three times, once for each equation.\u00a0   Before we do that let\u2019s sketch the graph of the region and see what   we\u2019ve got....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we have a triangle.\u00a0   Now, let\u2019s go through the transformation.\u00a0 We will apply the transformation to each   edge of the triangle and see where we get....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do ...\u00a0first.\u00a0   Plugging in the transformation gives,...The first boundary transforms very nicely into a much   simpler equation....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at ...,...Again, a much nicer equation that what we started with....\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s transform .......So, again, we got a somewhat simpler equation, although   not quite as nice as the first two....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at the new region that we get under the   transformation....\u00a0...We still get a triangle, but a much nicer one....\u00a0...Note that we can\u2019t always expect to transform a specific type of region (a triangle for example) into the same kind of region.\u00a0 It is completely possible to have a triangle transform into a region in which each of the edges are curved and in no way resembles a triangle....\u00a0...Notice that in each of the above examples we took a two dimensional region that would have been somewhat difficult to integrate over and converted it into a region that would be much nicer in integrate over.\u00a0 As we noted at the start of this set of examples, that is often one of the points behind the transformation.\u00a0 In addition to converting the integrand into something simpler it will often also transform the region into one that is much easier to deal with....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve seen a couple of examples of transforming regions we need to now talk about how we actually do change of variables in the integral.\u00a0 We will start with double integrals.\u00a0 In order to change variables in a double integral we will need the ... of the transformation.\u00a0 Here is the definition of the Jacobian....\u00a0...The ... of   the transformation ...,   ...\u00a0is...\u00a0...The Jacobian is defined as a determinant of a 2x2 matrix, if you are unfamiliar with this that is okay.\u00a0 Here is how to compute the determinant....\u00a0...Therefore, another formula for the determinant is,...\u00a0...Now that we have the Jacobian out of the way we can give the formula for change of variables for a double integral....\u00a0...Suppose that we want to integrate ...\u00a0over the region ....\u00a0 Under the   transformation ...,   ...\u00a0the region becomes ... and the integral becomes,...\u00a0...Note that we used ... instead of ... in the integral to make it clear that we are now integrating with respect to ... and ....\u00a0 Also note that we are taking the absolute value of the Jacobian....\u00a0...If we look just at the differentials in the above formula we can also say that...\u00a0...Show   that when changing to polar coordinates we have ...\u00a0...So, what we are doing here is justifying the formula that   we used back when we were integrating with respect to ....\u00a0 All that we need to do is use the formula   above for .......\u00a0...The transformation here is the standard conversion   formulas,...\u00a0...The Jacobian for this transformation is,...\u00a0...We then get,...\u00a0...So, the formula we used in the section on polar integrals was correct....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s do a couple of integrals....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the trapezoidal region with vertices given by ...,   ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0using the transformation ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...First, let\u2019s sketch the region ... and determine equations for each of the sides....\u00a0...Each of the equations was found by using the fact that we   know two points on each line (...   the two vertices that form the edge).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...While we could do this integral in terms of ... and ... it would involve two integrals and so would be some work....\u00a0...Let\u2019s use the transformation and see what we get.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do this by plugging the   transformation into each of the equations above....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start the process off with .......\u00a0...Transforming ...\u00a0is similar....\u00a0...Next we\u2019ll transform .......\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s transform .......The region ... is   then a rectangle whose sides are given by ...,   ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and so the ranges of ... and ... are,...\u00a0...Next, we need the Jacobian....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...Evaluate   ...\u00a0where ...   is the ellipse given by ...\u00a0and using the transformation ...,   .......The first thing to do is to plug the transformation into   the equation for the ellipse to see what the region transforms into....\u00a0...Or, upon dividing by 2 we see that the equation describing   ... transforms into...or the unit circle.\u00a0   Again, this will be much easier to integrate over than the original   region....\u00a0...Note as well that we\u2019ve shown that the function that we\u2019re   integrating is...in terms of ...   and ... so we won\u2019t have to redo that   work when the time to do the integral comes around....\u00a0...Finally, we need to find the Jacobian....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...Before proceeding a word of caution is in order.\u00a0 Do not make the mistake of substituting ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0in for the integrands.\u00a0 These equations are only valid on the   boundary of the region and we are looking at all the points interior to the   boundary as well and for those points neither of these equations will be   true!...\u00a0...At this point we\u2019ll note that this integral will be much   easier in terms of polar coordinates and so to finish the integral out will   convert to polar coordinates....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now briefly look at triple integrals.\u00a0 In this case we will again start with a region ... and use the transformation ..., ..., and ...\u00a0to transform the region into the new region ....\u00a0 To do the integral we will need a Jacobian, just as we did with double integrals.\u00a0 Here is the definition of the Jacobian for this kind of

need a refresher on how to compute them you should go back and review that section.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The integral under this transformation is,...\u00a0...As with double integrals we can look at just

and start off with a general region in terms of polar coordinates and see what we can do with that.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of some region using polar coordinates....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, our general region will be defined by inequalities,...\u00a0...Now, to find ... let\u2019s redo the figure above as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...As shown, we\u2019ll break up the region into a mesh of radial lines and arcs.\u00a0 Now, if we pull one of the pieces of the mesh out as shown we have something that is almost, but not quite a rectangle.\u00a0 The area of this piece is ....\u00a0 The two sides of this piece both have length ...\u00a0where ...\u00a0is the radius of the outer arc and ...\u00a0is the radius of the inner arc.\u00a0 Basic geometry then tells us that the length of the inner edge is ...\u00a0while the length of the out edge is ...\u00a0where ...\u00a0is the angle between the two radial lines that form the sides of this piece....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s assume that we\u2019ve taken the mesh so small that we can assume that ...\u00a0and with this assumption we can also assume that our piece is close enough to a rectangle that we can also then assume that,...\u00a0...Also, if we assume that the mesh is small enough then we can also assume that,...\u00a0...With these assumptions we then get .......\u00a0...In order to arrive at this we had to make the assumption that the mesh was very small.\u00a0 This is not an unreasonable assumption.\u00a0 ... that the definition of a double integral is in terms of two limits and as limits go to infinity the mesh size of the region will get smaller and smaller.\u00a0 In fact, as the mesh size gets smaller and smaller the formula above becomes more and more accurate and so we can say that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ll see another way of deriving this once we reach the ... section later in this chapter.\u00a0 This second way will not involve any assumptions either and so it maybe a little better way of deriving this....\u00a0...Before moving on it is again important to note that ....\u00a0 The actual formula for ... has an ... in it.\u00a0 It will be easy to forget this ... on occasion, but as you\u2019ll see without it some integrals will not be possible to do....\u00a0...Now, if we\u2019re going to be converting an integral in Cartesian coordinates into an integral in polar coordinates we are going to have to make sure that we\u2019ve also converted all the ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s into polar coordinates as well.\u00a0 To do this we\u2019ll need to remember the following conversion formulas,...\u00a0...We are now ready to write down a formula for the double integral in terms of polar coordinates....\u00a0...\u00a0...It is important to not forget the added ... and don\u2019t forget to convert the Cartesian coordinates in the function over to polar coordinates....\u00a0...Let\u2019s look at a couple of examples of these kinds of integrals....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integrals by converting them into polar coordinates....,   ... is the portion of the region   between the circles of radius 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and radius 5 centered at the origin   that lies in the first quadrant.\u00a0\u00a0 ...,   ... is the unit circle centered at   the origin.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...First let\u2019s get ...   in terms of polar coordinates.\u00a0 The   circle of radius 2 is given by ...\u00a0and the circle of radius 5 is given by ....\u00a0 We want the region between them so we will   have the following inequality for .......\u00a0...Also, since we only want the portion that is in the first   quadrant we get the following range of ...\u2019s....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve got these we can do the integral....\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget to do the conversions and to add in the extra   ....\u00a0   Now, let\u2019s simplify and make use of the double angle formula for sine   to make the integral a little easier.... ...\u00a0...In this case we can\u2019t do this integral in terms of   Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0 We will however   be able to do it in polar coordinates.\u00a0   First, the region ... is   defined by,...\u00a0...In terms of polar coordinates the integral is then,...\u00a0...Notice that the addition of the ... gives us an integral that we can now do.\u00a0 Here is the work for this integral....\u00a0...Let\u2019s not forget that we still have the two geometric interpretations for these integrals as well....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the region that lies inside ...\u00a0and outside .......\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the region, ..., that we want to determine the area of....\u00a0...\u00a0...To determine this area we\u2019ll need to know that value of ...\u00a0for which the two curves intersect.\u00a0 We can determine these points by setting   the two equations and solving....\u00a0...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the figure with these angles added....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note as well that we\u2019ve acknowledged that ...\u00a0is another representation for the angle ....\u00a0 This is important since we need the range   of ...\u00a0\u00a0to actually enclose the regions as we   increase from the lower limit to the upper limit.\u00a0 If we\u2019d chosen to use ...\u00a0then as we increase from ...\u00a0to ...\u00a0we would be tracing out the lower portion of   the circle and that is not the region that we are after....\u00a0...So, here are the ranges that will define the region....\u00a0...To get the ranges for ...   the function that is closest to the origin is the lower bound and the   function that is farthest from the origin is the upper bound....\u00a0...The area of the region ...   is then,...\u00a0...Determine   the volume of the region that lies under the sphere ...,   above the plane ...\u00a0and inside the cylinder .......\u00a0...We know that the formula for finding the volume of a   region is,...In order to make use of this formula we\u2019re going to need   to determine the function that we should be integrating and the region ... that we\u2019re going to be integrating   over....\u00a0...The function isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 It\u2019s just the sphere, however, we do need   it to be in the form ....\u00a0 We are looking at the region that lies   under the sphere and above the plane ...\u00a0(just the ...-plane right?) and so all we need to do is solve the equation   for ... and when taking the square   root we\u2019ll take the positive one since we are wanting the region above the ...-plane.\u00a0 Here is the function....\u00a0...The region ...   isn\u2019t too bad in this case either.\u00a0 As   we take points, ...,   from the region we need to completely graph the portion of the sphere that we   are working with.\u00a0 Since we only want   the portion of the sphere that actually lies inside the cylinder given by ...\u00a0this is also the region ....\u00a0 The region ... is the disk ...\u00a0in the ...-plane.   ...\u00a0...For reference purposes here is a sketch of the region that   we are trying to find the volume of....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the region that we want the volume for is really a   cylinder with a cap that comes from the sphere....\u00a0...We are definitely going to want to do this integral in   terms of polar coordinates so here are the limits (in polar coordinates) for   the region,...and we\u2019ll need to convert the function to polar coordinates   as well....\u00a0...The volume is then,...\u00a0...Find   the volume of the region that lies inside ...\u00a0and\u00a0   below the plane .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s start this example off with a quick sketch of the   region....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, in this case the standard formula is not going to   work.\u00a0 The formula...finds the volume under the function ...\u00a0and we\u2019re actually after the area that is   above a function.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t the   problem that it might appear to be however.\u00a0   First, notice that ...will be the volume under ...\u00a0(of course we\u2019ll need to determine ... eventually) while ...is the volume under ...,   using the same .......\u00a0...The volume that we\u2019re after is really the difference   between these two or,...Now all that we need to do is to determine the region ... and then convert everything over to   polar coordinates....\u00a0...Determining the region ...   in this case is not too bad.\u00a0 If we   were to look straight down the ...-axis   onto the region we would see a circle of radius 4 centered at the   origin.\u00a0 This is because the top of the   region, where the elliptic paraboloid intersects the plane, is the widest   part of the region. We know the ...   coordinate at the intersection so, setting ...\u00a0in the equation of the paraboloid gives, ...which is the equation of a circle of radius 4 centered at   the origin....\u00a0...Here are the inequalities for the region and the function   we\u2019ll be integrating in terms of polar coordinates....\u00a0...The volume is then,...\u00a0...In both of the previous volume problems we would have not been able to easily compute the volume without first converting to polar coordinates so, as these examples show, it is a good idea to always remember polar coordinates....\u00a0...There is one more type of example that we need to look at before moving on to the next section.\u00a0 Sometimes we are given an iterated integral that is already in terms of ... and ... and we need to convert this over to polar so that we can actually do the integral.\u00a0 We need to see an example of how to do this kind of conversion....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral by first converting to polar coordinates....First, notice that we cannot do this integral in Cartesian   coordinates and so converting to polar coordinates may be the only option we   have for actually doing the integral.\u00a0   Notice that the function will convert to polar coordinates nicely and   so shouldn\u2019t be a problem....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first determine the region that we\u2019re integrating   over and see if it\u2019s a region that can be easily converted into polar   coordinates.\u00a0 Here are the inequalities   that define the region in terms of Cartesian coordinates....\u00a0...Now, the upper limit for the ...\u2019s is,...and this looks like the right side of the circle of radius   1 centered at the origin.\u00a0 Since the   lower limit for the ...\u2019s is ...\u00a0it looks like we are going to have a portion   (or all) of the right side of the disk of radius 1 centered at the origin. ...\u00a0...The range for the ...\u2019s   however, tells us that we are only going to have positive ...\u2019s.\u00a0   This means that we are only going to have the portion of the disk of   radius 1 centered at the origin that is in the first quadrant....\u00a0...So, we know that the inequalities that will define this   region in terms of polar coordinates are then,...\u00a0...Finally, we just need to remember that,...\u00a0and so the integral   becomes,...\u00a0...Note that this is an integral that we can do.\u00a0 So, here is the rest of the work for this   integral.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DIPolarCoords.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus III - Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates", "subject": "math"}},

rectangular so we need to now look at the following double integral,...where ... is any region....\u00a0...There are two types of regions that we need to look at.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of both of them....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will often use ... to describe these regions.\u00a0 Here is the definition for the region in Case 1...and here is the definition for the region in Case 2....\u00a0...This notation is really just a fancy way of saying we are going to use all the points, ..., in which both of the coordinates satisfy the two given inequalities....\u00a0...The double integral for both of these cases are defined in terms of iterated integrals as follows....\u00a0...In Case 1 where ...\u00a0the integral is defined to be,...\u00a0...In Case 2 where ...\u00a0the integral is defined to be,...\u00a0...Here are some properties of the double integral that we should go over before we actually do some examples.\u00a0 Note that all three of these properties are really just extensions of properties of single integrals that have been extended to double integrals....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...,   where ... is any constant....If the region ... can be split into two separate   regions ... and ... then the integral can be   written as...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples of double integrals over general regions....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following integrals over the given region .......,\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...,\u00a0 ...   is the region bounded by ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0\u00a0

  so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case we need to determine the two inequalities for   ... and ... that we need to do the integral.\u00a0 The best way to do this is the graph the   two curves.\u00a0 Here is a sketch....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, from the sketch we can see that that two inequalities   are,...\u00a0...We can now do the integral,...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...We got even less information about the region this   time.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start this off by   sketching the triangle....\u00a0...\u00a0...Since we have two points on each edge it is easy to get the   equations for each edge and so we\u2019ll leave it to you to verify the equations....\u00a0...Now, there are two ways to describe this region.\u00a0 If we use functions of ..., as shown in the image we will have to break the region up into   two different pieces since the lower function is different depending upon the   value of ....\u00a0 In this case the region would be given by ...\u00a0where,...\u00a0...Note the ...\u00a0is the \u201cunion\u201d symbol and just means that ... is the region we get by combing the   two regions.\u00a0 If we do this then we\u2019ll   need to do two separate integrals, one for each of the regions....\u00a0...To avoid this we could turn things around and solve the   two equations for ... to get,...\u00a0...If we do this we can notice that the same function is   always on the right and the same function is always on the left and so the   region is,...\u00a0...Writing the region in this form means doing a single   integral instead of the two integrals we\u2019d have to do otherwise....\u00a0...Either way should give the same answer and so we can get   an example in the notes of splitting a region up let\u2019s do both integrals....\u00a0...\u00a0...That was a lot of work.\u00a0   Notice however, that after we did the first substitution that we   didn\u2019t multiply everything out.\u00a0 The   two quadratic terms can be easily integrated with a basic Calc I substitution   and so we didn\u2019t bother to multiply them out.\u00a0   We\u2019ll do that on occasion to make some of these integrals a little easier....\u00a0...This solution will be a lot less work since we are only   going to do a single integral....\u00a0...So, the numbers were a little messier, but other than that   there was much less work for the same result.\u00a0   Also notice that again we didn\u2019t cube out the two terms as they are   easier to deal with using a Calc I substitution....\u00a0...As the last part of the previous example has shown us we can integrate these integrals in either order (... ... followed by ... or ... followed by ...), although often one order will be easier than the other.\u00a0 In fact there will be times when it will not even be possible to do the integral in one order while it will be possible to do the integral in the other order....\u00a0...Let\u2019s see a couple of examples of these kinds of integrals....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integrals by first reversing the order of integration....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...First, notice that if we try to integrate with respect to ... we can\u2019t do the integral because we   would need a ... in front   of the exponential in order to do the ...   integration.\u00a0 We are going to hope that   if we reverse the order of integration we will get an integral that we can   do.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, when we say that we\u2019re going to reverse the order of   integration this means that we want to integrate with respect to ... first and then ....\u00a0 Note as well that we   can\u2019t just interchange the integrals, keeping the original limits, and be   done with it.\u00a0 This would not fix our   original problem and in order to integrate with respect to ... we can\u2019t have ...\u2019s in the limits of the integrals.\u00a0 Even if we ignored that the answer would   not be a constant as it should be....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s see how we reverse the order of   integration.\u00a0 The best way to reverse   the order of integration is to first sketch the region given by the original   limits of integration.\u00a0 From the   integral we see that the inequalities that define this region are,...\u00a0...These inequalities tell us that we want the region with ...\u00a0on the lower boundary and ...\u00a0on the upper boundary that lies between ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Here is a sketch of that region....\u00a0...\u00a0...Since we want to integrate with respect to ... first we will need to determine   limits of ... (probably in terms of ...) and then get the limits on the ...\u2019s.\u00a0   Here they are for this region....\u00a0...\u00a0...Any horizontal line drawn in this region will start at ...\u00a0and end at ...\u00a0and so these are the limits on the ...\u2019s and the range of ...\u2019s for the regions is 0 to 9....\u00a0...The integral, with the order reversed, is now,...and notice that we can do the first integration with this   order.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also hope that this will   give us a second integral that we can do.\u00a0   Here is the work for this integral....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...\u00a0As with the first   integral we cannot do this integral by integrating with respect to ... first so we\u2019ll hope that by   reversing the order of integration we will get something that we can   integrate.\u00a0 Here are the limits for the   variables that we get from this integral....and here is a sketch of this region....\u00a0...So, if we reverse the order of integration we get the   following limits....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...The final topic of this section is two geometric interpretations of a double integral.\u00a0 The first interpretation is an extension of the idea that we used to develop the idea of a double integral in the first ... of this chapter.\u00a0 We did this by looking at the volume of the solid that was below the surface of the function ...\u00a0and over the rectangle ... in the ...-plane.\u00a0 This idea can be extended to more general regions....\u00a0...The volume of the solid that lies below the surface given by ...\u00a0and above the region ... in the ...-plane is given by,...\u00a0...Find   the volume of the solid that lies below the surface given by ...\u00a0and lies above the region in the ...-plane bounded by ...\u00a0and ....   ...\u00a0...Here is the graph of the surface and we\u2019ve tried to show   the region in the ...-plane below   the surface....\u00a0\u00a0 ...Here is a sketch of the region in the ...-plane by itself....\u00a0...By setting the two bounding equations equal we can see   that they will intersect at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 So, the inequalities that will define the   region ... in the ...-plane are,...\u00a0...The volume is then given by,...\u00a0...Find   the volume of the solid enclosed by the planes ...,   ...,   ...,   .......\u00a0...

We\u2019ll look at one of those here and we\u2019ll look at the other in the next couple of sections....\u00a0...One way to get a sketch of trajectories is to do something similar to what we did the

all we need to do is sketch in some trajectories.\u00a0 To do this all we need to do is remember   that the vectors in the sketch above are tangent to the trajectories.\u00a0 Also the direction of the vectors give the   direction of the trajectory as ...   increases so we can show the time dependence of the solution by adding in   arrows to the trajectories....\u00a0...Doing this gives the following sketch....\u00a0...This sketch is called the ....\u00a0 Usually   phase portraits only include the trajectories of the solutions and not any   vectors.\u00a0 All of our phase portraits   form this point on will only include the trajectories....\u00a0...In this case it looks like most of the solutions will   start away from the equilibrium solution then as ... starts to increase they move in towards the equilibrium solution   and then eventually start moving away from the equilibrium solution   again.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There seem to be four solutions that have slightly   different

case ...   since all but two of the solutions are moving away from it as ... increases....\u00a0...As we noted earlier this is not generally the way that we will sketch trajectories.\u00a0 All we really need to get the trajectories are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix ....\u00a0 We will see how to do this over the next couple of sections as we solve the systems....\u00a0...Here

if it can be completely contained in a disk.\u00a0 In other words, a region will be bounded if   it is finite....\u00a0...Let\u2019s think a little more about the definition of closed.\u00a0 We said a region is closed if it includes its boundary.\u00a0 Just what does this mean?\u00a0 Let\u2019s think of a rectangle.\u00a0 Below are two definitions of a rectangle, one is closed and the other is open....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this first case we don\u2019t allow the ranges to include the endpoints (... we aren\u2019t including the edges of the rectangle) and so we aren\u2019t allowing the region to include any points on the edge of the rectangle.\u00a0 In other words, we aren\u2019t allowing the region to include its boundary and so it\u2019s open.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the second case we are allowing the region to contain points on the edges and so will contain its entire boundary and hence will be closed....\u00a0...This is an important idea because of the following fact....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is continuous in some closed, bounded set ... in ...\u00a0then there are points in ..., ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0so that ...\u00a0is the absolute maximum and ...\u00a0is the absolute minimum of the function in .......\u00a0...Note that this theorem does NOT tell us where the absolute minimum or absolute maximum will occur.\u00a0 It only tells us that they will exist.\u00a0 Note as well that the absolute minimum and/or absolute maximum may occur in the interior of the region or it may occur on the boundary of the region....\u00a0...The basic process for finding absolute maximums is pretty much identical to the process that we used in Calculus I when we looked at finding ... of functions of single variables.\u00a0 There will however, be some procedural changes to account for the fact that we now are dealing with functions of two variables.\u00a0 Here is the process....\u00a0...\u00a0...Find all the critical points of the function that   lie in the region ... and determine   the function value at each of these points....   ...   ...Find all extrema of the function on the   boundary.\u00a0 This usually involves the   Calculus I approach for this work....   ...   ...The largest and smallest values found in the   first two steps are the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum of the   function....   ...   ...\u00a0...The main difference between this process and the process that we used in Calculus I is that the \u201cboundary\u201d in Calculus I was just two points and so there really wasn\u2019t a lot to do in the second step.\u00a0 For these problems the majority of the work is often in the second step as we will often end up doing a Calculus I absolute extrema problem one or more times....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example or two....\u00a0...Find   the absolute minimum and absolute maximum of ...\u00a0on the rectangle given by ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s first get a quick picture of the rectangle for   reference purposes....\u00a0...The boundary of this rectangle is given by the following   conditions....These will be important in the second step of our process....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start this off by finding all the critical points   that lie inside the given rectangle.\u00a0   To do this we\u2019ll need the two first order derivatives....\u00a0...Note that since we aren\u2019t going to be classifying the   critical points we don\u2019t need the second order derivatives.\u00a0 To find the critical points we will need to   solve the system,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We can solve the second equation for ... to get,...\u00a0...Plugging this into the first equation gives us,...\u00a0...This tells us that we must have ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 Now, recall that we only want critical   points in the region that we\u2019re given.\u00a0   That means that we only want critical points for which ....\u00a0 The only value of ... that will satisfy this is the first one so we can ignore the   last two for this problem.\u00a0 Note   however that a simple change to the boundary would include these two so don\u2019t   forget to always check if the critical points are in the region (or on the   boundary since that can also happen)....\u00a0...Plugging ...\u00a0into the equation for ... gives us,...\u00a0...The single critical point, in the region (and again,   that\u2019s important), is ....\u00a0 We now need to get the value of the   function at the critical point....Eventually we will compare this to values of the function   found in the next step and take the largest and smallest as the absolute   extrema of the function in the rectangle....\u00a0...Now we have reached the long part of this problem.\u00a0 We need to find the absolute extrema of the   function along the boundary of the rectangle.\u00a0   What this means is that we\u2019re going to need to look at what the   function is doing along each of the sides of the rectangle listed above. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s first take a look at the right side.\u00a0 As noted above the right side is defined by   ...\u00a0...Notice that along the right side we know that ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s take advantage of this by defining a   new function as follows,...\u00a0...Now, finding the absolute extrema of ...\u00a0along the right side will be equivalent to   finding the absolute extrema of ...\u00a0in the range ....\u00a0 Hopefully you ... how to do this from Calculus   I.\u00a0 We find the critical points of ...\u00a0in the range ...\u00a0and then evaluate ...\u00a0at the critical points and the end points of   the range of ...\u2019s....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do that for this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0This is in the   range and so we will need the following function evaluations....\u00a0...Notice that, using the definition of ...\u00a0these are also function values for .......\u00a0...We can now do the left side of the rectangle which is   defined by,...\u00a0...Again, we\u2019ll define a new function as follows,...\u00a0...Notice however that, for this boundary, this is the same   function as we looked at for the right side.\u00a0   This will not always happen, but since it has let\u2019s take advantage of   the fact that we\u2019ve already done the work for this function.\u00a0 We know that the critical point is ...\u00a0and we know that the function value at the   critical point and the end points are,...\u00a0...The only real difference here is that these will   correspond to values of ...\u00a0at different points than for the right   side.\u00a0 In this case these will   correspond to the following function values for .......\u00a0...We can now look at the upper side defined by,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll again define a new function except this time it will   be a function of .......\u00a0...We need to find the absolute extrema of ...\u00a0on the range ....\u00a0 First find the critical point(s)....\u00a0...The value of this function at the critical point and the   end points is,...and these in turn correspond to the following function   values for ...\u00a0...Note that there are several \u201crepeats\u201d here.\u00a0 The first two function values have already   been computed when we looked at the right and left side.\u00a0 This will often happen....\u00a0...Finally, we need to take care of the lower side.\u00a0 This side is defined by,...\u00a0...The new function we\u2019ll define in this case is,...\u00a0...The critical point for this function is,...\u00a0...The function values at the critical point and the endpoint   are,...and the corresponding values for ...\u00a0are,...\u00a0...The final step to this (long\u2026) process is to collect up   all the function values for ...\u00a0that we\u2019ve computed in this problem.\u00a0 Here they are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The absolute minimum is at ...\u00a0since gives the smallest function value and   the absolute maximum occurs at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0since these two points give the largest   function value....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the function on the rectangle for   reference purposes....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As this example has shown these can be very long problems.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at an easier problem with a different kind of boundary....\u00a0...Find   the absolute minimum and absolute maximum of\u00a0   ...\u00a0on the disk of radius 4, ...\u00a0...First note that a disk of radius 4 is given by the   inequality in the problem statement.\u00a0   The \u201cless than\u201d inequality is included to get the interior of the disk   and the equal sign is included to get the boundary.\u00a0 Of course, this also means that the   boundary of the disk is a circle of radius 4....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first find the critical points of the function that   lies inside the disk.\u00a0 This will require   the following two first order partial derivatives....\u00a0...\u00a0To find the   critical points we\u2019ll need to solve the following system....\u00a0...This is actually a fairly simple system to solve   however.\u00a0 The first equation tells us   that ...\u00a0and the second tells us that ....\u00a0 So the only critical point for this   function is ...\u00a0and this is inside the disk of radius   4.\u00a0 The function value at this critical   point is,...\u00a0...Now we need to look at the boundary.\u00a0 This one will be somewhat different from   the previous example.\u00a0 In this case we   don\u2019t have fixed values of ... and ... on the boundary.\u00a0 Instead we have,...\u00a0...We can solve this for ...\u00a0and plug this into the ...\u00a0in ...\u00a0to get a function of ... as follows....\u00a0...We will need to find the absolute extrema of this function   on the range ...\u00a0(this is the range of ...\u2019s for the disk\u2026.).\u00a0 We\u2019ll   first need the critical points of this function....\u00a0...The value of this function at the critical point and the   endpoints are,...\u00a0...Unlike the first example we will still need to find the   values of ... that correspond to   these.\u00a0 We can do this by plugging the   value of ... into our equation for   the circle and solving for .......\u00a0...The function values for ...\u00a0then correspond to the following function   values for .......\u00a0...Note that the third one actually corresponded to two   different values for ...\u00a0since that ... also produced two different values of .......\u00a0...So, comparing these values to the value of the function at   the critical point of ...\u00a0that we found earlier we can see that the   absolute minimum occurs at ...\u00a0while the absolute maximum occurs twice at ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the region for reference purposes....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In both of these examples one of the absolute extrema actually occurred at more than one place.\u00a0 Sometimes this will happen and sometimes it won\u2019t so don\u2019t read too much into the fact that it happened in both examples given here....\u00a0...Also note that, as we\u2019ve seen, absolute extrema will often occur on the boundaries of these regions, although they don\u2019t have to occur at the boundaries.\u00a0 Had we given much more complicated examples with multiple critical points we would have seen examples where the absolute extrema occurred interior to the region and not on the boundary.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/AbsoluteExtrema.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes :

(including all repeated   eigenvalues) then,...If ...\u00a0occurs only once in the list then we call ...\u00a0.......If ...\u00a0occurs ...   times in the list then we say that ...\u00a0has .......If ...\u00a0(...) are   the simple eigenvalues in the list with corresponding eigenvectors ...,   ...,   \u2026, ...\u00a0then the eigenvectors are all linearly independent....If ...\u00a0is an eigenvalue of multiplicity ... then ...\u00a0will have anywhere from 1 to ... linearly independent eigenvectors....\u00a0...\u00a0...The usefulness of these facts will become apparent when we get back into differential equations since in that work we will want linearly independent solutions....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples now to see how we actually go about finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors....\u00a0...Find   the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix....The first thing that we need to do is find the   eigenvalues.\u00a0 That means we need the   following matrix,...In particular we need to determine where the determinant   of this matrix is zero....\u00a0...So, it looks like we will have two simple eigenvalues for   this matrix, ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 We will now need to find the eigenvectors   for each of these.\u00a0 Also note that   according to the fact above, the two eigenvectors should be linearly   independent.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To find the eigenvectors we simply plug in each eigenvalue   into ...   and solve.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...\u00a0:...In this case we need to solve the following system....\u00a0...Recall that officially to solve this system we use the   following augmented matrix....\u00a0...Upon reducing down we see that we get a single equation...that will yield an infinite number of solutions.\u00a0 This is expected behavior.\u00a0 Recall that we picked the eigenvalues so   that the matrix would be singular and so we would get infinitely many   solutions....\u00a0...Notice as well that we could have identified this from the   original system.\u00a0 This won\u2019t always be   the case, but in the 2 x 2 case we can see from the system that one row will   be a multiple of the other and so we will get infinite solutions.\u00a0 From this point on we won\u2019t be actually   solving systems in these cases.\u00a0\u00a0 We   will just go straight to the equation and we can use either of the two rows   for this equation....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s get back to the eigenvector, since that is what   we were after.\u00a0 In general then the   eigenvector will be any vector that satisfies the following,...To get this we used the solution to the equation that we   found above.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We really don\u2019t want a general eigenvector however so we   will pick a value for ...\u00a0to get a specific eigenvector.\u00a0 We can choose anything (except ...), so pick something that will make   the eigenvector \u201cnice\u201d.\u00a0 Note as well   that since we\u2019ve already assumed that the eigenvector is not zero we must   choose a value that will not give us zero, which is why we want to avoid    ...\u00a0in this case.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the eigenvector for this eigenvalue....\u00a0...Now we get to do this all over again for the second   eigenvalue....\u00a0...\u00a0:...We\u2019ll do much less work with this part than we did with   the previous part.\u00a0 We will need to   solve the following system....\u00a0...Clearly both rows are multiples of each other and so we   will get infinitely many solutions.\u00a0 We   can choose to work with either row.\u00a0   We\u2019ll run with the first because to avoid having too many minus signs   floating around.\u00a0 Doing this gives us,...\u00a0...Note that we can solve this for either of the two   variables.\u00a0 However, with an eye   towards working with these later on let\u2019s try to avoid as many fractions as   possible.\u00a0 The eigenvector is then,...\u00a0...Summarizing we have,...Note that the two eigenvectors are linearly independent as   predicted....\u00a0...Find   the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix....This matrix has fractions in it.\u00a0 That\u2019s life so don\u2019t get excited about   it.\u00a0 First we need the eigenvalues....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got an eigenvalue of multiplicity   2 here.\u00a0 Remember that the power on the   term will be the multiplicity....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s find the eigenvector(s).\u00a0 This one is going to be a little different   from the first example.\u00a0 There is only   one eigenvalue so let\u2019s do the work for that one.\u00a0 We will need to solve the following system,...\u00a0...So, the rows are multiples of each other.\u00a0 We\u2019ll work with the first equation in this   example to find the eigenvector....\u00a0...Recall in the last example we decided that we wanted to   make these as \u201cnice\u201d as possible and so should avoid fractions if we   can.\u00a0 Sometimes, as in this case, we   simply can\u2019t so we\u2019ll have to deal with it.\u00a0   In this case the eigenvector will be,...\u00a0...Note that by careful choice of the variable in this case   we were able to get rid of the fraction that we had.\u00a0 This is something that in general doesn\u2019t   much matter if we do or not.\u00a0 However,   when we get back to differential equations it will be easier on us if we   don\u2019t have any fractions so we will usually try to eliminate them at this   step....\u00a0...Also in this case we are only going to get a single   (linearly independent) eigenvector.\u00a0 We   can get other eigenvectors, by choosing different values of ....\u00a0 However, each of these will be linearly   dependent with the first eigenvector.\u00a0   If you\u2019re not convinced of this try it.\u00a0 Pick some values for ...\u00a0and get a different vector and check to see   if the two are linearly dependent....\u00a0...Recall from the fact above that an eigenvalue of   multiplicity ... will have anywhere   from 1 to ... linearly independent   eigenvectors.\u00a0 In this case we got   one.\u00a0 For most of the 2 x 2 matrices   that we\u2019ll be working with this will be the case, although it doesn\u2019t have to   be.\u00a0 We can, on occasion, get two....\u00a0...Find   the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix....So, we\u2019ll start with the eigenvalues....\u00a0...This doesn\u2019t factor, so upon using the quadratic formula   we arrive at,...\u00a0...In this case we get complex eigenvalues which are   definitely a fact of life with eigenvalue/eigenvector problems so get used to   them....\u00a0...Finding eigenvectors for complex eigenvalues is identical   to the previous two examples, but it will be somewhat messier.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...\u00a0:...The system that we need to solve this time is...\u00a0...Now, it\u2019s not super clear that the rows are multiples of   each other, but they are.\u00a0 In this case   we have,...\u00a0...This is not something that you need to worry about, we   just wanted to make the point.\u00a0 For the   work that we\u2019ll be doing later on with differential equations we will just   assume that we\u2019ve done everything correctly and we\u2019ve got two rows that are   multiples of each other.\u00a0 Therefore,   all that we need to do here is pick one of the rows and work with it....\u00a0...We\u2019ll work with the second row this time....\u00a0...Now we can solve for either of the two variables.\u00a0 However, again looking forward to   differential equations, we are going to need the \u201c...\u201d in the numerator so solve the equation in such a way as this   will happen.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...So, the eigenvector in this case is...\u00a0...As with the previous example we choose the value of the   variable to clear out the fraction....\u00a0...Now, the work for the second eigenvector is almost   identical and so we\u2019ll not dwell on that too much....\u00a0:...The system that we need to solve here is...\u00a0...Working with the second row again gives,...\u00a0...The eigenvector in this case is...Summarizing, ...\u00a0...There is a nice fact that we can use to simplify the work when we get complex eigenvalues.\u00a0 We need a bit of terminology first however....\u00a0...If we start with a complex number,...\u00a0then the ... of ... is...\u00a0...To compute the complex conjugate of a complex number we simply change the sign on the term that contains the \u201c...\u201d.\u00a0 The complex conjugate of a vector is just the conjugate of each of the vector\u2019s components....\u00a0...We now have the following fact about complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors....\u00a0...If ... is an ... x ... matrix with only real numbers and if ...\u00a0is an eigenvalue with eigenvector ....\u00a0 Then ...\u00a0is also an eigenvalue and its eigenvector is   the conjugate of .......\u00a0...This fact is something that you should feel free to use as you need to in our work....\u00a0...Now, we need to work one final eigenvalue/eigenvector problem.\u00a0 To this point we\u2019ve only worked with 2 x 2 matrices and we should work at least one that isn\u2019t 2 x 2.\u00a0 Also, we need to work one in which we get an eigenvalue of multiplicity greater than one that has more than one linearly independent eigenvector....\u00a0...Find   the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix....Despite the fact that this is a 3 x 3 matrix, it still   works the same as the 2 x 2 matrices that we\u2019ve been working with.\u00a0 So, start with the eigenvalues...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got a simple eigenvalue and an eigenvalue of   multiplicity 2.\u00a0\u00a0 Note that we used the   same method of computing the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix that we used in   the previous section.\u00a0 We just didn\u2019t   show the work....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now get the eigenvectors.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with the simple eigenvector....\u00a0:...Here we\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...This time, unlike the 2 x 2 cases we worked earlier, we   actually need to solve the system.\u00a0 So   let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...\u00a0...Going back to equations gives,...\u00a0...So, again we get infinitely many solutions as we should   for eigenvectors.\u00a0 The eigenvector is   then,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s do the other eigenvalue....\u00a0...\u00a0:...Here we\u2019ll need to solve,...\u00a0...Okay, in this case is clear that all three rows are the   same and so there isn\u2019t any reason to actually solve the system since we can   clear out the bottom two rows to all zeroes in one step.\u00a0 The equation that we get then is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this case we get to pick two of the values for free   and will still get infinitely many solutions.\u00a0   Here is the general eigenvector for this case,...\u00a0...Notice the restriction this time.\u00a0 Recall that we only require that the   eigenvector not be the zero vector.\u00a0   This means that we can allow one or the other of the two variables to   be zero, we just can\u2019t allow both of them to be zero at the same time!...\u00a0...What this means for us is that we are going to get two   linearly independent eigenvectors this time.\u00a0   Here they are....\u00a0...Now when we talked about linear independent vectors in the   last ... we only looked at ... vectors each with ... components.\u00a0 We can still talk about linear independence   in this case however.\u00a0 Recall ... with we did linear independence for functions   we saw at the time that if two functions were linearly dependent then they   were multiples of each other.\u00a0 Well the   same thing holds true for vectors.\u00a0 Two   vectors will be linearly dependent if they are multiples of each other.\u00a0 In this case there is no way to get ...\u00a0by multiplying ...\u00a0by a constant.\u00a0 Therefore, these two vectors must be   linearly independent....\u00a0...So, summarizing up, here are the eigenvalues and   eigenvectors for this

optimal points in the interior of the region isn\u2019t too bad in general, all that we needed to do was find the critical points and plug them into the function.\u00a0 However, as we saw in the examples finding potential optimal points on the boundary was often a fairly long and messy process.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this section we are going to take a look at another way of optimizing a function subject to given constraint(s).\u00a0 The constraint(s) may be the equation(s) that describe the boundary of a region although in this section we won\u2019t concentrate on those types of problems since this method just requires a general constraint and doesn\u2019t really care where the constraint came from....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get things set up.\u00a0 We want to optimize (... find the minimum and maximum value of) a function, ..., subject to the constraint ....\u00a0 Again, the constraint may be the equation that describes the boundary of a region or it may not be.\u00a0 The process is actually fairly simple, although the work can still be a little overwhelming at times....\u00a0...\u00a0...The constant, ...,   is called the .......\u00a0...Notice that the system of equations actually has four equations, we just wrote the system in a simpler form.\u00a0 To see this let\u2019s take the first equation and put in the definition of the gradient vector to see what we get....\u00a0...In order for these two vectors to be equal the individual components must also be equal.\u00a0 So, we actually have three equations here....These three equations along with the constraint, ..., give four equations with four unknowns ..., ..., ..., and .......\u00a0...Note as well that if we only have functions of two variables then we won\u2019t have the third component of the gradient and so will only have three equations in three unknowns ..., ..., and .......\u00a0...As a final note we also need to be careful with the fact that in some cases minimums and maximums won\u2019t exist even though the method will seem to imply that they do.\u00a0 In every problem we\u2019ll need to go back and make sure that our answers make sense....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples....\u00a0...Find   the dimensions of the box with largest volume if the total surface area is 64   cm.......\u00a0...Before we start the process here note that we also saw a   way to solve this kind of problem in ..., except in those problems we required a condition that related one of   the sides of the box to the other sides so that we could get down to a volume   and surface area function that only involved two variables.\u00a0 We no longer need this condition for these   problems. ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s get on to solving the problem.\u00a0 We first need to identify the function that   we\u2019re going to optimize as well as the constraint.\u00a0 Let\u2019s set the length of the box to be ..., the width of the box to be ... and the height of the box to be ....\u00a0   Let\u2019s also note that because we\u2019re dealing with the dimensions of a   box it is safe to assume that ..., ..., and ... are all positive quantities....\u00a0...We want to find the largest volume and so the function   that we want to optimize is given by,...\u00a0...Next we know that the surface area of the box must be a   constant 64.\u00a0 So this is the   constraint.\u00a0 The surface area of a box   is simply the sum of the areas of each of the sides so the constraint is   given by,...\u00a0...Note that we divided the constraint by 2 to simplify the   equation a little.\u00a0 Also, we get the   function ...\u00a0from this....\u00a0...Here are the four equations that we need to solve....\u00a0...There are many ways to solve this system.\u00a0 We\u2019ll solve it in the following way.\u00a0 Let\u2019s multiply equation ...   by ..., equation ...   by ... and equation ...   by ....\u00a0 This gives,...Now notice that we can set equations ...   and ...   equal.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...This gave two possibilities.\u00a0 The first, ...\u00a0is not possible since if this was the case   equation ...   would reduce to ...Since we are talking about the dimensions of a box neither   of these are possible so we can discount ....\u00a0 This leaves the second possibility....\u00a0...Since we know that ...\u00a0(again since we are talking about the   dimensions of a box) we can cancel the ...   from both sides.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s set equations ...   and ...   equal.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...As already discussed we know that ...\u00a0won\u2019t work and so this leaves,...We can also say that ...since we are dealing with the   dimensions of a box so we must have,...\u00a0...Plugging equations ...   and ...   into equation ...   we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...However, we know that ...   must be positive since we are talking about the dimensions of a box.\u00a0 Therefore the only solution that makes   physical sense here is ...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got a cube here....\u00a0...We should be a little careful here.\u00a0 Since we\u2019ve only got one solution we might   be tempted to assume that these are the dimensions that will give the largest   volume.\u00a0 The method of Lagrange   Multipliers will give a set of points that will either maximize or minimize a   given function subject to the constraint, provided there actually are   minimums or maximums.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The function itself, ...\u00a0will clearly have neither minimums or maximums   unless we put some restrictions on the variables.\u00a0 The only real restriction that we\u2019ve got is   that all the variables must be positive.\u00a0   This, of course, instantly means that the function does have a   minimum, zero....\u00a0...The function will not have a maximum if all the variables   are allowed to increase without bound.\u00a0   That however, can\u2019t happen because of the constraint, ...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here we\u2019ve got the sum of three positive numbers (because ..., ...,   and ... are positive) and the sum   must equal 32.\u00a0 So, if one of the   variables gets very large, say ...,   then because each of the products must be less than 32 both ... and ... must be very small to make sure the first two terms are less   than 32.\u00a0 So, there is no way for all   the variables to increase without bound and so it should make some sense that   the function, ...,   will have a maximum....   ...   ...This isn\u2019t a rigorous proof that the function will have a   maximum, but it should help to visualize that in fact it should have a   maximum and so we can say that we will get a maximum volume if the dimensions   are : .......\u00a0...Notice that we never actually found values for ...\u00a0in the above example.\u00a0 This is fairly standard for these kinds of problems.\u00a0 The value of ...\u00a0isn\u2019t really important to determining if the point is a maximum or a minimum so often we will not bother with finding a value for it.\u00a0 On occasion we will need its value to help solve the system, but even in those cases we won\u2019t use it past finding the point....\u00a0...Find   the maximum and minimum of ...\u00a0subject to the constraint .......\u00a0...This one is going to be a little easier than the previous   one since it only has two variables.\u00a0   Also, note that it\u2019s clear from the constraint that region of possible   solutions lies on a disk of radius ...\u00a0which is a closed and bounded region and   hence by the ...\u00a0 we know that a minimum and   maximum value must exist....\u00a0...Here is the system that we need to solve....\u00a0...Notice that, as with the last example, we can\u2019t have ...\u00a0since that would not satisfy the first two   equations.\u00a0 So, since we know that ...we can solve the first two equations   for ... and ... respectively.\u00a0 This   gives,...\u00a0...Plugging these into the constraint gives,...\u00a0...We can solve this for ....   ...\u00a0...Now, that we know ...\u00a0we can find the points that will be   potential maximums and/or minimums....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0we get,...and if ...\u00a0we get,...\u00a0...To determine if we have maximums or minimums we just need   to plug these into the function.\u00a0 Also   recall from the discussion at the start of this solution that we know these   will be the minimum and maximums because the Extreme Value Theorem tells us   that minimums and maximums will exist for this problem....\u00a0...Here are the minimum and maximum values of the function....\u00a0...In the first two examples we\u2019ve excluded ...\u00a0either for physical reasons or because it wouldn\u2019t solve one or more of the equations.\u00a0 Do not always expect this to happen.\u00a0 Sometimes we will be able to automatically exclude a value of ...\u00a0and sometimes we won\u2019t....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example....\u00a0...Find   the maximum and minimum values of ...\u00a0subject to the constraint ....\u00a0 Assume that .......\u00a0...First note that our constraint is a sum of three positive   or zero number and it must be 1.\u00a0   Therefore it is clear that our solution will fall in the range ....\u00a0 Therefore the solution must lie in a closed   and bounded region and so by the ...\u00a0 we know that a minimum and maximum value   must exist....\u00a0...Here is the system of equation that we need to solve....Let\u2019s start this solution process off by noticing that   since the first three equations all have ...\u00a0they are all equal.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s start off by setting equations ...   and ...   equal....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got two possibilities here.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off with by assuming that ....\u00a0 In this case we can see from either   equation ...   or ...   that we must then have ....\u00a0   From equation ... we see that this means   that ....\u00a0   This in turn means that either ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got two possible cases to deal with there.\u00a0 In each case two of the variables must be   zero.\u00a0 Once we know this we can plug   into the constraint, equation ...,   to find the remaining value....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got two possible solutions ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Now let\u2019s go back and take a look at the other   possibility, ....\u00a0 We also have two possible cases to look at   here as well....\u00a0...This first case is ....\u00a0 In this case we can see from the constraint   that we must have ...\u00a0and so we now have a third solution .......\u00a0...The second case is ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s set equations ...   and ...   equal....\u00a0...Now, we\u2019ve already assumed that ...\u00a0and so the only possibility is that ....\u00a0 However, this also means that,...\u00a0...Using this in the constraint gives,...So, the next solution is .......\u00a0...We got four solutions by setting the first two equations   equal.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To completely finish this problem out we should probably   set equations ...   and ...   equal as well as setting equations ...   and ...   equal to see what we get.\u00a0 Doing this   gives,...\u00a0...Both of these are very similar to the first situation that   we looked at and we\u2019ll leave it up to you to show that in each of these cases   we arrive back at the four solutions that we already found....\u00a0...So, we have four solutions that we need to check in the   function to see whether we have minimums or maximums....\u00a0...So, in this case the maximum occurs only once while the   minimum occurs three times....\u00a0...Note as well that we never really used the assumption that   ...\u00a0in this problem.\u00a0 This assumption is here mostly to make sure   that we really do have a maximum and a minimum of the function.\u00a0 Without this assumption it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult   to find points that give both larger and smaller values of the   functions.\u00a0 For example....\u00a0...\u00a0...With these examples you can clearly see that it\u2019s not too   hard to find points that will give larger and smaller function values.\u00a0 However, all of these examples required   negative values of ..., ... and/or ... to make sure we satisfy the constraint.\u00a0 By eliminating these we will know that   we\u2019ve got minimum and maximum values by the Extreme Value Theorem....\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve only looked at constraints that were equations.\u00a0 We can also have constraints that are inequalities.\u00a0 The process for these types of problems is nearly identical to what we\u2019ve been doing in this section to this point.\u00a0 The main difference between the two types of problems is that we will also need to find all the critical points that satisfy the inequality in the constraint and check these in the function when we check the values we found using Lagrange Multipliers....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work an example to see how these kinds of problems work....\u00a0...Find   the maximum and minimum values of ...\u00a0on the disk .......\u00a0...Note that the constraint here is the inequality for the   disk.\u00a0 Because this is a closed and   bounded region the ... tells us that a minimum and maximum value must exist....\u00a0...The first step is to find all the critical points that are   in the disk (... satisfy the   constraint).\u00a0 This is easy enough to do   for this problem.\u00a0 Here are the two   first order partial derivatives....\u00a0...So, the only critical point is ...\u00a0and it does satisfy the inequality....\u00a0...At this point we proceed with Lagrange Multipliers and we   treat the constraint as an equality instead of the inequality.\u00a0 We only need to deal with the inequality   when finding the critical points....\u00a0...So, here is the system of equations that we need to solve....\u00a0...From the first equation we get,...\u00a0...If we have ...\u00a0then the constraint gives us .......\u00a0...If we have ...\u00a0the second equation gives us,...The constraint then tells us that .......\u00a0...If we\u2019d performed a similar analysis on the second   equation we would arrive at the same points....\u00a0...So, Lagrange Multipliers gives us four points to check : ...,   ...,   ...,   and .......\u00a0...To find the maximum and minimum we need to simply plug   these four points along with the critical point in the function....\u00a0...In this case, the minimum was interior to the disk and the   maximum was on the boundary of the disk....\u00a0...The final topic that we need to discuss in this section is what to do if we have more than one constraint.\u00a0 We will look only at two constraints, but we can naturally extend the work here to more than two constraints....\u00a0...We want to optimize ...\u00a0subject to the constraints ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The system that we need to solve in this case is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this case we get two Lagrange Multipliers.\u00a0 Also, note that the first equation really is three equations as we saw in the previous examples.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see an example of this kind of optimization problem....\u00a0...Find   the maximum and minimum of ...\u00a0subject to the constraints ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Verifying that we will have a minimum and maximum value   here is a little trickier.\u00a0 Clearly,   because of the second constraint we\u2019ve got to have ....\u00a0 With this in mind there must also be a set   of limits on ... in order to make   sure that the first constraint is met.\u00a0   If one really wanted to determine that range you could find the   minimum and maximum values of ...\u00a0subject to ...\u00a0and you could then use this to determine the   minimum and maximum values of ....\u00a0 We won\u2019t do that here.\u00a0 The point is only to acknowledge that once   again the possible solutions must lie in a closed and bounded region and so   minimum and maximum values must exist by the .......\u00a0...Here is the system of equations that we need to solve....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s notice that from equation ...   we get ....\u00a0   Plugging this into equation ...   and equation ...   and solving for ... and ... respectively gives,...\u00a0...Now, plug these into equation .......\u00a0...So, we have two cases to look at here.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s see what we get when ....\u00a0 In this case we know that,...Plugging these into equation ...   gives,...So, we\u2019ve got one solution....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now see what we get if we take ....\u00a0 Here we have,...Plugging these into equation ...   gives,...and there\u2019s a second solution....\u00a0...Now all that we need to is check the two solutions in the   function to see which is the maximum and which is the minimum....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we have a maximum at ...\u00a0and a minimum at ....", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Because we are going to be working almost exclusively with systems of equations in which the number of unknowns equals the number of equations we will restrict our review to these kinds of systems.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...All of what we will be doing here can be easily extended to systems with more unknowns than equations or more equations than unknowns if need be....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the following system of ... equations with the ... unknowns, ....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that in the subscripts on the coefficients in this system, ... the ... corresponds to the equation that the coefficient is in and the ... corresponds to the unknown that is multiplied by the coefficient....\u00a0...To use linear algebra to solve this system we will first write down the ... for this system.\u00a0 An augmented matrix is really just all the coefficients of the system and the numbers for the right side of the system written in matrix form. \u00a0Here is the augmented matrix for this system....\u00a0...To solve this system we will use elementary row operations (which we\u2019ll define these in a bit) to rewrite the augmented matrix in triangular form.\u00a0 The matrix will be in triangular form if all the entries below the main diagonal (the diagonal containing ...) are zeroes....\u00a0...Once this is done we can recall that each row in the augmented matrix corresponds to an equation.\u00a0 We will then convert our new augmented matrix back to equations and at this point solving the system will become very easy....\u00a0...Before working an example let\u2019s first define the elementary row operations.\u00a0 There are three of them....\u00a0...It\u2019s always a little easier to understand these operations if we see them in action.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s solve a couple of systems....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....The first step is to write down the augmented matrix for   this system.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget that   coefficients of terms that aren\u2019t present are zero....\u00a0...Now, we want the entries below the main diagonal to be   zero.\u00a0 The main diagonal has been   colored red so we can keep track of it during this first example.\u00a0 For reasons that will be apparent   eventually we would prefer to get the main diagonal entries to all be ones as   well....\u00a0...We can get a one in the upper most spot by noticing that   if we interchange the first and second row we will get a one in the uppermost   spot for free.\u00a0 So let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Now we need to get the last two entries (the -2 and 3) in   the first column to be zero.\u00a0 We can do   this using the third row operation.\u00a0   Note that if we take 2 times the first row and add it to the second   row we will get a zero in the second entry in the first column and if we take   -3 times the first row to the third row we will get the 3 to be a zero.\u00a0 We can do both of these operations at the   same time so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Before proceeding with the next step, let\u2019s make sure that   you followed what we just did.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   take a look at the first operation that we performed.\u00a0 This operation says to multiply an entry in   row 1 by 2 and add this to the corresponding entry in row 2 then replace the   old entry in row 2 with this new entry.\u00a0   The following are the four individual operations that we performed to   do this....\u00a0...Okay, the next step optional, but again is convenient to   do.\u00a0 Technically, the 5 in the second   column is okay to leave.\u00a0 However, it   will make our life easier down the road if it is a 1.\u00a0 We can use the second row operation to take   care of this.\u00a0 We can divide the whole   row by 5.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The next step is to then use the third row operation to   make the -6 in the second column into a zero....\u00a0...Now, officially we are done, but again it\u2019s somewhat   convenient to get all ones on the main diagonal so we\u2019ll do one last step....\u00a0...We can now convert back to equations....\u00a0...At this point the solving is quite easy.\u00a0 We get ...   for free and once we get that we can plug this into the second equation and   get ....\u00a0 We can then use the first equation to get ....\u00a0 Note as well that having 1\u2019s along the main   diagonal helped somewhat with this process....\u00a0...The solution to this system of equation is...\u00a0...The process used in this example is called ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at another example....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....First write down the augmented matrix....\u00a0...We won\u2019t put down as many words in working this   example.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the work for this   augmented matrix....\u00a0...We won\u2019t go any farther in this example.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go back to equations to see why....\u00a0...The last equation should cause some concern.\u00a0 There\u2019s one of three options here.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ve somehow managed to prove that   0 equals 8 and we know that\u2019s not possible.\u00a0   Second, we\u2019ve made a mistake, but after going back over our work it   doesn\u2019t appear that we have made a mistake....\u00a0...This leaves the third option.\u00a0 When we get something like the third   equation that simply doesn\u2019t make sense we immediately know that there is no   solution.\u00a0 In other words, there is no   set of three numbers that will make all three of the equations true at the   same time....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another example.\u00a0 We are going to get the system for this new example by making a very small change to the system from the previous example....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....So, the only difference between this system and the system   from the second example is we changed the 1 on the right side of the equal   sign in the third equation to a -7.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now write down the augmented matrix for this system....\u00a0...The steps for this problem are identical to the steps for   the second problem so we won\u2019t write them all down.\u00a0 Upon performing the same steps we arrive at   the following matrix....\u00a0...This time the last equation reduces to...and unlike the second example this is not a problem.\u00a0 Zero does in fact equal zero!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We could stop here and go back to equations to get a   solution and there is a solution in this case.\u00a0 However, if we go one more step and get a   zero above the one in the second column as well as below it our life will be   a little simpler.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...If we now go back to equation we get the following two   equations....\u00a0...We have two equations and three unknowns.\u00a0 This means that we can solve for two of the   variables in terms of the remaining variable.\u00a0   Since ... is in   both equations we will solve in terms of that....\u00a0...What this solution means is that we can pick the value of ... to be anything that we\u2019d   like and then find values of ...   and ....\u00a0 In these cases we typically write the   solution as follows,...\u00a0...In this way we get an infinite number of solutions, one   for each and every value of .......\u00a0...These three examples lead us to a nice fact about systems of equations....\u00a0...Given a system of equations, ...,   we will have one of the three possibilities for the number of solutions....1....No   solution....2....Exactly   one solution....3....Infinitely   many solutions....\u00a0...Before moving on to the next section we need to take a look at one more situation.\u00a0 The system of equations in ... is called a nonhomogeneous system if at least one of the ...s is not zero.\u00a0 If however all of the ...s are zero we call the system homogeneous and the system will be,...Now, notice that in the homogeneous case we are guaranteed to have the following solution....\u00a0This solution is often called the .......\u00a0...For homogeneous systems the fact above can be modified to the following....\u00a0...Given a homogeneous system of equations, ...,   we will have one of the two possibilities for the number of solutions....\u00a0...In the second possibility we can say non-zero solution because if there are going to be infinitely many solutions and we know that one of them is the trivial solution then all the rest must have at least one of the ...s be non-zero and hence we get a non-zero solution.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/LA_Systems.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls

(or a ...)   of ...\u00a0provided one of the following is true,...\u00a0...To see the equivalence in the first part let\u2019s start off with ...\u00a0and put in the definition of each part....The only way that these two vectors can be equal is to have\u00a0 ...\u00a0and .... In fact, we will use this definition of the critical point more than the gradient definition since it will be easier to find the critical points if we start with the partial derivative definition....\u00a0...Note as well that BOTH of the first order partial derivatives must be zero at ....\u00a0 If only one of the first order partial derivatives are zero at the point then the point will NOT be a critical point....\u00a0...We now have the following fact that, at least partially, relates critical points to relative extrema....\u00a0...If the point ...\u00a0is a relative extrema of the function ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is also a critical point of ...and in fact we\u2019ll have ...\u00a0...This is a   really simple proof that relies on the single variable version that we ... in Calculus I version, often   called Fermat\u2019s Theorem....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off   by defining ...\u00a0and suppose that ...\u00a0has a relative extrema at ....\u00a0 However, this also means that ...\u00a0also has a relative extrema (of the same   kind as ...) at ....\u00a0 By Fermat\u2019s Theorem we then know that ....\u00a0 But we also know that ...\u00a0and so we have that .......\u00a0...If we now   define ...\u00a0and going through exactly the same process   as above we will see that .......\u00a0...So, putting all   this together means that ...\u00a0and so ...\u00a0has a critical point at ....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that this does NOT say that all critical points are relative extrema.\u00a0 It only says that relative extrema will be critical points of the function.\u00a0 To see this let\u2019s consider the function...\u00a0...The two first order partial derivatives are,...\u00a0...The only point that will make both of these derivatives zero at the same time is ...\u00a0and so ...\u00a0is a critical point for the function.\u00a0 Here is a graph of the function....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that the axes are not in the

other words, no matter what region you take about the origin there will be points larger than ...\u00a0and points smaller than ....\u00a0 Therefore, there is no way that ...\u00a0can be a relative extrema....\u00a0...Critical points that exhibit this kind of behavior are called .......\u00a0...While we have to be careful to not misinterpret the results of this fact it is very useful in helping us to identify relative extrema.\u00a0 Because of this fact we know that if we have all the critical points of a function then we also have every possible relative extrema for the function.\u00a0 The fact tells us that all relative extrema must be critical points so we know that if the function does have relative extrema then they must be in the collection of all the critical points.\u00a0 Remember however, that it will be completely possible that at least one of the critical points won\u2019t be a relative extrema....\u00a0...So, once we have all the critical points in hand all we will need to do is test these points to see if they are relative extrema or not.\u00a0 To determine if a critical point is a relative extrema (and in fact to determine if it is a minimum or a maximum) we can use the following fact....\u00a0...Suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point of ...\u00a0and that the second order partial derivatives   are continuous in some region that contains ....\u00a0 Next define,...\u00a0...We then have the following classifications of the critical   point....\u00a0...Note that if ...\u00a0then both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will have the same sign and so in the first two cases above we could just as easily replace ...\u00a0with ....\u00a0 Also note that we aren\u2019t going to be seeing any cases in this class where ....\u00a0 We will be able to classify all the critical points that we find....\u00a0...Let\u2019s see a couple of examples....\u00a0...Find   and classify all the critical points of .......\u00a0...We first need all the first order (to find the critical   points) and second order (to classify the critical points) partial   derivatives so let\u2019s get those....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s first find the critical points. \u00a0Critical points will be solutions to the   system of equations,...\u00a0...This is a non-linear system of equations and these can, on   occasion, be difficult to solve.\u00a0   However, in this case it\u2019s not too bad.\u00a0 We can solve the first equation for ... as follows,...\u00a0...Plugging this into the second equation gives,...\u00a0...From this we can see that we must have ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 Now use the fact that ...\u00a0to get the critical points....\u00a0...So, we get two critical points.\u00a0 All we need to do now is classify   them.\u00a0 To do this we will need ....\u00a0   Here is the general formula for .......\u00a0...To classify the critical points all that we need to do is   plug in the critical points and use the fact above to classify them....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, for

sake of completeness here is a graph of this   function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that in order to get a better visual we used a   somewhat nonstandard orientation.\u00a0 We   can see that there is a relative minimum at ...\u00a0and (hopefully) it\u2019s clear that at ...\u00a0we do get a saddle point....\u00a0...Find   and classify all the critical points for ...\u00a0...As with the first example we will first need to get all   the first and second order derivatives....\u00a0...We\u2019ll first need the critical points.\u00a0 The equations that we\u2019ll need to solve this   time are,...\u00a0...These equations are a little trickier to solve than the   first set, but once you see what to do they really aren\u2019t terribly bad....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s notice that we can factor out a 6... from the first equation to get,...So, we can see that the first equation will be zero if ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 Be careful to not just cancel the ... from both sides.\u00a0 If we had done that we would have missed .......\u00a0...To find the critical points we can plug these   (individually) into the second equation and solve for the remaining variable....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, if ...\u00a0we have the following critical points,...and if ...\u00a0the critical points are,...\u00a0...Now all we need to do is classify the critical   points.\u00a0 To do this we\u2019ll need the   general formula for .......\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it looks like we have the following classification of   each of these critical points....\u00a0...Here is a graph of the surface for the sake of   completeness....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s do one more example that is a little different from the first two....\u00a0...Determine   the point on the plane ...\u00a0that is closest to the point .......\u00a0...Note that we are NOT asking for the critical points of the   plane.\u00a0 In order to do this example we   are going to need to first come up with the equation that we are going to   have to work with....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s suppose that ...\u00a0is any point on the plane.\u00a0 The distance between this point and the   point in question, ...,   is given by the formula,...\u00a0...What we are then asked to find is the minimum value of this   equation.\u00a0 The point ...\u00a0that gives the minimum value of this   equation will be the point on the plane that is closest to .......\u00a0...There are a couple of issues with this equation.\u00a0 First, it is a function of ..., ...   and ... and we can only deal with   functions of ... and ... at this point.\u00a0 However, this is easy to fix.\u00a0 We can solve the equation of the plane to   see that,...\u00a0...Plugging this into the distance formula gives,...\u00a0...Now, the next issue is that there is a square root in this   formula and we know that we\u2019re going to be differentiating this   eventually.\u00a0 So, in order to make our   life a little easier let\u2019s notice that finding the minimum value of ... will be equivalent to finding the   minimum value of .......\u00a0...So, let\u2019s instead find the minimum value of ...\u00a0...Now, we need to be a little careful here.\u00a0 We are being asked to find the closest   point on the plane to ...\u00a0and that is not really the same thing as   what we\u2019ve been doing in this section.\u00a0   In this section we\u2019ve been finding and classifying critical points as   relative minimums or maximums and what we are really asking is to find the smallest   value the function will take, or the absolute minimum.\u00a0 Hopefully, it does make sense from a   physical standpoint that there will be a closest point on the plane to ....\u00a0 Also, this point should be a relative   minimum. ...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s go through the process from the first and second   example and see what we get as far as relative minimums go.\u00a0 If we only get a single relative minimum   then we will be done since that point will also need to be the absolute   minimum of the function and hence the point on the plane that is closest to .......\u00a0...We\u2019ll need the derivatives first....\u00a0...Now, before we get into finding the critical point let\u2019s   compute ... quickly....\u00a0...So, in this case ...   will always be positive and also notice that ...\u00a0is always positive and so any critical   points that we get will be guaranteed to be relative minimums....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s find the critical point(s).\u00a0 This will mean solving the system....\u00a0...To do this we can solve the first equation for .......\u00a0...Now, plug this into the second equation and solve for .......\u00a0...Back substituting this into the equation for ... gives .......\u00a0...So, it looks like we get a single critical point : ....\u00a0 Also, since we know this will be a relative   minimum and it is the only critical point we know that this is also the ... and ... coordinates of the point on the plane that we\u2019re after.\u00a0 We can find the ... coordinate by plugging into the equation of the plane as   follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the point on the plane that is closest to ...\u00a0is ....", "url":

multiply the entries on each   diagonal up and the if the diagonal runs from left to right we add them up   and if the diagonal runs from right to left we subtract them....\u00a0...Here is the work

to the 3 x 3 identity.\u00a0   In other words we want a 1 on the diagonal that starts at the upper   left corner and zeroes in all the other entries in the first three columns....\u00a0...If you think

able to convert the first three columns into   the 3 x 3 identity matrix therefore the inverse exists and it is,...\u00a0...So, there was an example in which the inverse did exist.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at an example in which the inverse doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Find   the inverse of the following matrix, provided it exists....In this case we will tack on the 2 x 2 identity to get

an IVP.\u00a0 What we\u2019ve managed to find at this point is   not the solution, but its ...   transform.\u00a0 So, in order to find the   solution all that we need to do is to take the inverse transform....\u00a0...Before doing that let\u2019s notice that in its present form we   will have to do partial fractions twice.\u00a0   However, if we combine the two terms up we will only be doing partial   fractions once.\u00a0 Not only that, but the   denominator for the combined term will be identical to the denominator of the   first term.\u00a0 This means that we are going   to partial fraction up a term with that denominator no matter what so we might   as well make the numerator slightly messier and then just partial fraction   once....\u00a0...This is one of those things where we are apparently making   the problem messier, but in the process we are going to save ourselves a fair   amount of work! ...\u00a0...Combining the two terms gives,...\u00a0...The partial fraction decomposition for this transform is,...\u00a0...Setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Picking appropriate values of ... and solving for the constants gives,...\u00a0...Plugging in the constants gives,...\u00a0...Finally taking the inverse transform gives us the solution   to the IVP....\u00a0...That was a fair amount of work for a problem that probably could have been solved much quicker using the techniques from the previous chapter.\u00a0 The point of this problem however, was to show how we would use ... transforms to solve an IVP....\u00a0...There are a couple of things to note here about using ... transforms to solve an IVP.\u00a0 First, using ... transforms reduces a differential equation down to an algebra problem.\u00a0 In the case of the last example the algebra was probably more complicated than the straight forward approach from the last chapter.\u00a0 However, in later problems this will be reversed.\u00a0 The algebra, while still very messy, will often be easier than a straight forward approach....\u00a0...Second, unlike the approach in the last chapter, we did not need to first find a general solution, differentiate this, plug in the initial conditions and then solve for the constants to get the solution.\u00a0 With Laplace transforms, the initial conditions are applied during the first step and at the end we get the actual solution instead of a general solution....\u00a0...In many of the later problems ... transforms will make the problems significantly easier to work than if we had done the straight forward approach of the last chapter.\u00a0 Also, as we will see, there are some differential equations that simply can\u2019t be done using the techniques from the last chapter and so, in those cases, ... transforms will be our only solution....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another fairly simple problem....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....As with the first example, let\u2019s first take the ... transform of all the terms in the differential   equation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll the plug in the   initial conditions to get,...\u00a0...Now solve for .......\u00a0...Now, as we did in the last example we\u2019ll go ahead and   combine the two terms together as we will have to partial fraction up the   first denominator anyway, so we may as well make the numerator a little more   complex and just do a single partial fraction.\u00a0 This will give,...\u00a0...The partial fraction decomposition is then,...\u00a0...Setting numerator equal gives,...\u00a0...In this case it\u2019s probably easier to just set coefficients   equal and solve the resulting system of equation rather than pick values of ....\u00a0   So, here is the system and its solution....\u00a0...We will get a common denominator of 125 on all these   coefficients and factor that out when we go to plug them back into the transform.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Notice that we also had to factor a 2 out of the   denominator of the first term and fix up the numerator of the last term in   order to get them to match up to the correct entries in our table of transforms.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Taking the inverse transform then gives,...\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....Take the ...   transform of everything and plug in the initial conditions....\u00a0...Now solve for ...   and combine into a single term as we did in the previous two examples....\u00a0...Now, do the partial fractions on this.\u00a0 First let\u2019s get the partial fraction   decomposition....\u00a0...Now, setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Setting coefficients equal and solving for the constants   gives,...\u00a0...Now, plug these into the decomposition, complete the   square on the denominator of the second term and then fix up the numerators   for the inverse transform process....\u00a0...Finally, take the inverse transform....\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve only looked at IVP\u2019s in which the initial values were at ....\u00a0 This is because we need the initial values to be at this point in order to take the ... transform of the derivatives.\u00a0 The problem with all of this is that there are IVP\u2019s out there in the world that have initial values at places other than ....\u00a0 ... transforms would not be as useful as it is if we couldn\u2019t use it on these types of IVP\u2019s.\u00a0 So, we need to take a look at an example in which the initial conditions are not at ... in order to see how to handle these kinds of problems....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....The first thing that we will need to do here is to take   care of the fact that initial conditions are not at ....\u00a0 The only way that   we can take the ... transform of the   derivatives is to have the initial conditions at .......\u00a0...This means that we will need to formulate the IVP in such   a way that the initial conditions are at ....\u00a0 This is actually fairly   simple to do, however we will need to do a change of variable to make it   work. We are going to define...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the original differential equation....\u00a0...Notice that we put in the ... part on the derivatives to make sure that we get things   correct here.\u00a0 We will next substitute   in for .......\u00a0...Now, to simplify life a little let\u2019s define,...\u00a0...Then, by the chain rule, we get the following for the   first derivative....\u00a0...By a similar argument we get the following for the second   derivative....The initial conditions for ... are,...The IVP under these new variables is then,...\u00a0...This is an IVP that we can use ...   transforms on provided we replace all the ...\u2019s   in our ... with ...\u2019s.\u00a0 So, taking the ...   transform of this new differential equation and plugging in the new initial   conditions gives,...\u00a0...Solving for ...   gives,...\u00a0...Note that unlike the previous examples we did not   completely combine all the terms this time.\u00a0   In all the previous examples we did this because the denominator of   one of the terms was the common denominator for all the terms.\u00a0 Therefore, upon combining, all we did was   make the numerator a little messier, and reduced the number of partial   fractions required down from two to one.\u00a0   Note that all the terms in this transform that had only powers of ... in the denominator were combined for   exactly this reason....\u00a0...In this transform however, if we combined both of the   remaining terms into a single term we would be left with a fairly involved   partial fraction problem.\u00a0 Therefore,   in this case, it would probably be easier to just do partial fractions   twice.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done several partial   fractions problems in this section and many partial fraction problems in the   previous couple of sections so we\u2019re going to leave the details of the   partial fractioning to you to check.\u00a0   Partial fractioning each of the terms in our transform gives us the following....\u00a0...Plugging these into our transform and combining like terms   gives us...\u00a0...Now, taking the inverse transform will give the solution   to our new IVP.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to use ...\u2019s   instead of ...\u2019s!...\u00a0...This is not the solution that we are after of course.\u00a0 We are after ....\u00a0 However, we can get   this by noticing that ...\u00a0...So the solution to the original IVP is,...\u00a0...So, we can now do IVP\u2019s that don\u2019t have initial conditions that are at ....\u00a0 We also saw in the last example that it isn\u2019t always the best to combine all the terms into a single partial fraction problem as we have been doing prior to this example....\u00a0...The examples worked in this section would have been just as easy, if not easier, if we had used techniques from the previous chapter.\u00a0 They were worked here using ... transforms to illustrate the technique and method.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/IVPWithLaplace.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Differential Equations - Solving IVP's with Laplace Tranforms", "subject": "math"}},

the ... transform we need to get another definition out of the way....\u00a0...A function is called ... on an interval if the interval can be broken into a finite number of subintervals on which the

switches.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Write   the following function (or switch) in terms of Heaviside functions....There are three sudden shifts in this function and so   (hopefully) it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re going to need three Heaviside functions   here, one for each shift in the function.\u00a0   Here\u2019s the function in terms of Heaviside functions....\u00a0...It\u2019s fairly easy to verify this....\u00a0...In the first interval, ... all three Heaviside functions are off and the function has the   value...Notice that when we ...   that Heaviside functions are on or off we tend to not write them at all as we   did in this case....\u00a0...In the next interval, ...\u00a0the first Heaviside function is now on while   the remaining two are still off.\u00a0 So,   in this case the function has the value....\u00a0...In the third interval, ...\u00a0the first two Heaviside functions are one   while the last remains off.\u00a0 Here the   function has the value....\u00a0...In the last interval, ...all three Heaviside function are one   and the function has the value....\u00a0...So, the function has the correct value in all the   intervals....\u00a0...All of this is fine, but

took advantage of the fact that the Heaviside function will be zero if ... and 1 otherwise.\u00a0 This means that we can drop the Heaviside function and start the integral at ... instead of 0.\u00a0 Now use the substitution ... and the integral becomes,...\u00a0...The second exponential has no ...\u2019s in it and so it can be factored out of the integral. \u00a0Note as well that in the substitution process the lower limit of integration went back to 0....\u00a0...Now, the integral left is nothing more than the integral that we would need to compute if we were going to find the Laplace transform of ...\u00a0 Therefore, we get the following formula...In order to use ... the function ... must be shifted by ..., the same value that is used in the Heaviside function.\u00a0 Also note that we only take the transform of ... and not ...!\u00a0 We can also turn this around to get a useful formula for inverse ... transforms....\u00a0...We can use ... to get the ... transform of a Heaviside function by itself.\u00a0 To do this we will consider the function in ... to be ....\u00a0 Doing this gives us...\u00a0...Putting all of this together leads to the following two formulas....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do some examples....\u00a0...Find   the ... transform of each of the   following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...In all of these problems remember that the function ... be in the form...before we start taking transforms.\u00a0 If it isn\u2019t in that form we will have to   put it into that form!...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So there are three terms in this function.\u00a0 The first is simply a Heaviside function   and so we can use ...   on this term.\u00a0 The second and third   terms however have functions with them and we need to identify the functions   that are shifted for each of these.\u00a0 In   the second term it appears that we are using the following function,...and this has been shifted by the correct amount....\u00a0...The third term uses the following function,...which has also been shifted by the correct amount....\u00a0...With these functions identified we can now take the   transform of the function....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This part is going to cause some problems.\u00a0 There are two terms and neither has been   shifted by the proper amount.\u00a0 The   first term needs to be shifted by 3 and the second needs to be shifted by   5.\u00a0 So, since they haven\u2019t been   shifted, we will need to force the issue.\u00a0   We will need to add in the shifts, and then take them back out of   course.\u00a0 Here they are....\u00a0...Now we still have some potential problems here.\u00a0 The first function is still not really   shifted correctly, so we\u2019ll need to use ...to get this shifted correctly. ...\u00a0...The second term can be dealt with in one of two ways.\u00a0 The first would be to use the formula ...to break it up into cosines and sines with arguments of ...-5 which will be shifted as we   expect.\u00a0 There is an easier way to do   this one however.\u00a0 From our table of ... transforms we have ... and using that we can see that if ...\u00a0...This will make our life a little easier so we\u2019ll do it   this way....\u00a0...Now, breaking up the first term and leaving the second   term alone gives us,...\u00a0...Okay, so it looks like the two functions that have been   shifted here are...Taking the transform then gives,...\u00a0...It\u2019s messy, especially the second term, but there it   is.\u00a0 Also, do not get excited about the   ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 They are just numbers....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This one isn\u2019t as bad as it might look on the   surface.\u00a0 The first thing that we need   to do is write it in terms of Heaviside functions....\u00a0...Since the ...   is in both terms there isn\u2019t anything to do when we add in the Heaviside   function.\u00a0 The only thing that gets   added in is the sine term.\u00a0 Notice as   well that the sine has been shifted by the proper amount....\u00a0...All we need to do now is to take the transform....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Again, the first thing that we need to do is write the   function in terms of Heaviside functions....\u00a0...We had to add in a \u201c-8\u201d in the second term since that   appears in the second part and we also had to subtract a ... in the second term since the ... in the first portion is no longer there.\u00a0 This subtraction of the ... adds a problem because the second   function is no longer correctly shifted.\u00a0   This is easier to fix than the previous example however....\u00a0...Here is the corrected function....\u00a0...So, in the second term it looks like we are shifting...\u00a0...The transform is then,...\u00a0...Without the Heaviside function taking ... transforms is not a terribly difficult process provided we have our trusty ....\u00a0 However, with the advent of Heaviside functions, taking transforms can become a fairly messy process on occasion....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s do some inverse ... transforms to see how they are done....\u00a0...Find   the inverse ... transform of each of the   following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...All of these will use ...   somewhere in the process.\u00a0 Notice that   in order to use this formula the exponential doesn\u2019t really enter into the   mix until the very end.\u00a0 The vast   majority of the process is finding the inverse transform of the stuff without   the exponential....\u00a0...In these problems we are not going to go into detail on   many of the inverse transforms.\u00a0 If you   need a refresher on some of the basics of inverse transforms go back and take   a look at the previous .......\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In light of the comments above let\u2019s first rewrite the   transform in the following way....\u00a0...Now, this problem really comes down to needing ....\u00a0   So, let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need   to partial fraction ... up.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the partial fraction decomposition....\u00a0...Setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll find the constants here by selecting values of ....\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...So, the partial fraction decomposition becomes,...\u00a0...Notice that we factored a 3 out of the denominator in   order to actually do the inverse transform.\u00a0   The inverse transform of this is then,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s go back and do the actual problem.\u00a0 The original transform was,...\u00a0...Note that we didn\u2019t bother to plug in ....\u00a0 There really isn\u2019t a   reason to plug it back in.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just   use ...   to write down the inverse transform in terms of symbols.\u00a0 The inverse transform is,...where, ... is,...\u00a0...This is all the farther that we\u2019ll go with the   answer.\u00a0 There really isn\u2019t any reason   to plug in ... at this point.\u00a0 It would make the function longer and   definitely messier.\u00a0 We will give   almost all of our answers to these types of inverse transforms in this form....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This problem is not as difficult as it might at first   appear to be.\u00a0 Because there are two   exponentials we will need to deal with them separately eventually.\u00a0 Now, this might lead us to conclude that   the best way to deal with this function is to split it up as follows,...\u00a0...Notice that we factored out the exponential, as we did in   the last example, since we would need to do that eventually anyway.\u00a0 This is where a fairly common complication   arises.\u00a0 Many people will call the   first function ... and the second   function ... and the partial   fraction both of them.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...However, if instead of just factoring out the exponential   we would also factor out the coefficient we would get,...\u00a0...Upon doing this we can see that the two functions are in   fact the same function.\u00a0 The only   difference is the constant that was in the numerator.\u00a0 So, the way that we\u2019ll do these problems is   to first notice that both of the exponentials have only constants as   coefficients.\u00a0 Instead of breaking   things up then, we will simply factor out the whole numerator and get,...and now we will just partial fraction .......\u00a0...Here is the partial fraction decomposition....\u00a0...Setting numerators equal and combining gives us,...\u00a0...Setting coefficient equal and solving gives,...\u00a0...Substituting back into the transform gives and fixing up   the numerators as needed gives,...\u00a0...As we did in the previous section we factored out the   common denominator to make our work a little simpler.\u00a0 Taking the inverse transform then gives,...\u00a0...At this point we can go back and start thinking about the   original problem....\u00a0...We\u2019ll also need to distribute the ... through as well in order to get the correct inverse   transform.\u00a0 Recall that in order to use   ...   to take the inverse transform you must have a single exponential times a   single transform.\u00a0 This means that we   must multiply the ... through the   parenthesis.\u00a0 We can now take the   inverse transform,...where,...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case, unlike the previous part, we will need to   break up the transform since one term has a constant in it and the other has   an ....\u00a0 Note as well that we don\u2019t consider the   exponential in this, only its coefficient.\u00a0   Breaking up the transform gives,...\u00a0...We will need to partial fraction both of these terms   up.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with .......\u00a0...Setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Now, pick values of ...   to find the constants....\u00a0...So ... and its   inverse transform is,...\u00a0...Now, repeat the process for .... ...\u00a0...Setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Now, pick values of ...   to find the constants....\u00a0...So ... and its   inverse transform is,...\u00a0...Putting all of this together gives the following,...where,...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This one looks messier than it actually is.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first rearrange the numerator a   little....\u00a0...In this form it looks like we can break this up into two   pieces that will require partial fractions.\u00a0   When we break these up we should always try and break things up into   as few pieces as possible for the partial fractioning.\u00a0 Doing this can save you a great deal of   unnecessary work.\u00a0 Breaking up the   transform as suggested above gives,...\u00a0...Note that we canceled an ... in ....\u00a0 You should always simplify as much a   possible before doing the partial fractions.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s partial fraction up ...first....\u00a0...Setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Now, pick values of ...   to find the constants....\u00a0...So ... and its   inverse transform is,...\u00a0...Now partial fraction .......\u00a0...Setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Pick values of ...   to find the constants....\u00a0...So ... and its   inverse transform is,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s go back to the original problem, remembering to   multiply the transform through the parenthesis....\u00a0...Taking the inverse transform gives,...\u00a0...So, as this example has shown, these can be a somewhat messy.\u00a0 However, the mess is really only that of notation and amount of work.\u00a0 The actual partial fraction work was identical to the previous sections work.\u00a0 The main difference in this section is we had to do more of it.\u00a0 As far as the inverse transform process goes.\u00a0 Again, the vast majority of that was identical to the previous section as well....\u00a0...So, don\u2019t let the apparent messiness of these problems get you to decide that you can\u2019t do them.\u00a0 Generally they aren\u2019t as bad as they seem initially.", "url":

last ....\u00a0 What we would like to do now is go the other way....\u00a0...We are going to be given a transform, ..., and ask what function (or functions) did we have originally.\u00a0 As you will see this can be a more complicated and lengthy process than taking transforms.\u00a0 In these cases we say that we are finding the ... of ... and use the following notation....\u00a0...As with ...

take the inverse transform of the individual transforms, put any constants back in and then add or subtract the results back up....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of fairly simple inverse transforms....\u00a0...Find   the inverse transform of each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...I\u2019ve always felt that the key to doing inverse transforms   is to look at the denominator and try to identify what you\u2019ve got based on   that.\u00a0 If there is only one entry in   the table that has that particular denominator, the next step is to make sure   the numerator is correctly set up for the inverse transform process.\u00a0 If it isn\u2019t, correct it (this is always   easy to do) and then take the inverse transform....\u00a0...If there is more than one entry in the table has a   particular denominator, then the numerators of each will be different, so go   up to the numerator and see which one you\u2019ve got.\u00a0 If you need to correct the numerator to get   it into the correct form and then take the inverse transform....\u00a0...So, with this advice in mind let\u2019s see if we can take some   inverse transforms....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...From the denominator of the first term it looks like the   first term is just a constant.\u00a0 The   correct numerator for this term is a \u201c1\u201d so we\u2019ll just factor the 6 out   before taking the inverse transform.\u00a0   The second term appears to be an exponential with ... and the numerator is exactly what it needs to be.\u00a0 The third term also appears to be an   exponential, only this time ...\u00a0and we\u2019ll need to factor the 4 out before   taking the inverse transforms....\u00a0...So, with a little more detail than we\u2019ll usually put into   these,...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first term in this case looks like an exponential with   ...\u00a0and we\u2019ll need to factor out the 19.\u00a0 Be careful with negative signs in these problems,   it\u2019s very easy to lose track of them....\u00a0...The second term almost looks like an exponential, except   that it\u2019s got a ... instead of just   an ... in the denominator.\u00a0 It is an exponential, but in this case   we\u2019ll need to factor a 3 out of the denominator before taking the inverse   transform....\u00a0...The denominator of the third term appears to be ... in the table with ....\u00a0 The numerator however, is not correct for   this.\u00a0 There is currently a 7 in the numerator   and we need a 4! = 24 in the numerator.\u00a0   This is very easy to fix.\u00a0   Whenever a numerator is off by a multiplicative constant, as in this   case, all we need to do is put the constant that we need in the   numerator.\u00a0 We will just need to   remember to take it back out by dividing by the same constant....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s first rewrite the transform....\u00a0...So, what did we do here?\u00a0   We factored the 19 out of the first term.\u00a0 We factored the 3 out of the denominator of   the second term since it can\u2019t be there for the inverse transform and in the   third term we factored everything out of the numerator except the 4! since   that is the portion that we need in the numerator for the inverse transform   process....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take the inverse transform....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this part we\u2019ve got the same denominator in both terms   and our table tells us that we\u2019ve either got ...   or ....\u00a0   The numerators will tell us which we\u2019ve actually got.\u00a0 The first one has an ... in the numerator and so this means that the first term must be #8   and we\u2019ll need to factor the 6 out of the numerator in this case.\u00a0 The second term has only a constant in the   numerator and so this term must be #7, however, in order for this to be   exactly #7 we\u2019ll need to multiply/divide a 5 in the numerator to get it correct   for the table....\u00a0...The transform becomes,...\u00a0...Taking the inverse transform gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case the first term will be a sine once we factor   a 3 out of the denominator, while the second term appears to be a hyperbolic   sine (...).\u00a0 Again, be careful with the difference   between these two.\u00a0 Both of the terms   will also need to have their numerators fixed up.\u00a0 Here is the transform once we\u2019re done   rewriting it....\u00a0...Notice that in the first term we took advantage of the   fact that we could get the 2 in the numerator that we needed by factoring the   8. \u00a0The inverse transform is then,...\u00a0...So, probably the best way to identify the transform is by looking at the denominator.\u00a0 If there is more than one possibility use the numerator to identify the correct one.\u00a0\u00a0 Fix up the numerator if needed to get it into the form needed for the inverse transform process.\u00a0 Finally, take the inverse transform....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do some slightly harder problems.\u00a0 These are a little more involved than the first set....\u00a0...Find   the inverse transform of each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...From the denominator of this one it appears that it is   either a sine or a cosine.\u00a0 However,   the numerator doesn\u2019t match up to either of these in the table.\u00a0 A cosine wants just an ... in the numerator with at most a multiplicative constant, while   a sine wants only a constant and no ...   in the numerator.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ve got both in the numerator.\u00a0 This is easy to fix however.\u00a0 We will just split up the transform into   two terms and then do inverse transforms....\u00a0...Do not get too used to always getting the perfect squares   in sines and cosines that we saw in the first set of examples.\u00a0 More often than not (at least in my class)   they won\u2019t be perfect squares!...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case there are no denominators in our table that   look like this.\u00a0 We can however make   the denominator look like one of the denominators in the table by completing   the square on the denominator.\u00a0 So,   let\u2019s do that first....\u00a0...Recall that in completing the square you take half the   coefficient of the ..., square this,   and then add and subtract the result to the polynomial.\u00a0 After doing this the first three terms   should factor as a perfect square....\u00a0...So, the transform can be written as the following....\u00a0...Okay, with this rewrite it looks like we\u2019ve got ... and/or ...\u2019s from our table of transforms.\u00a0 However, note that in order for it to be a ... we want just a constant in the numerator   and in order to be a ... we need an ...   in the numerator.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got neither of   these so we\u2019ll have to correct the numerator to get it into proper form....\u00a0...In correcting the numerator always get the ...   first.\u00a0 This is the important   part.\u00a0 We will also need to be careful   of the 3 that sits in front of the ....\u00a0 One way to take care of this is to break   the term into two pieces, factor the 3 out of the second and then fix up the   numerator of this term.\u00a0 This will   work, however it will put three terms into our answer and there are really   only two terms.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we will leave the transform as a single term and   correct it as follows,...\u00a0...We needed an ...   in the numerator, so we put that in.\u00a0   We just needed to make sure and take the 4 back out by subtracting it   back out.\u00a0 Also, because of the 3   multiplying the ... we needed to do   all this inside a set of parenthesis.\u00a0   Then we partially multiplied the 3 through the second term and   combined the constants.\u00a0 With the   transform in this form, we can break it up into two transforms each of which   are in the tables and so we can do inverse transforms on them,...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This one is similar to the last one.\u00a0 We just need to be careful with the   completing the square however.\u00a0 The   first thing that we should do is factor a 2 out of the denominator, then   complete the square.\u00a0 Remember that   when completing the square a coefficient of 1 on the ... term is needed!\u00a0   So, here\u2019s the work for this transform....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got ... and ...   with a corrected numerator.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the   work for that and the inverse transform....\u00a0...In correcting the numerator of the second term, notice   that I only put in the square root since we already had the \u201cover 2\u201d part of   the fraction that we needed in the numerator....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This one appears to be similar to the previous two, but it   actually isn\u2019t.\u00a0 The denominators in   the previous two couldn\u2019t be easily factored.\u00a0   In this case the denominator does factor and so we need to deal with   it differently.\u00a0 Here is the transform   with the factored denominator....\u00a0...The denominator of this transform seems to suggest that   we\u2019ve got a couple of exponentials, however in order to be exponentials there   can only be a single term in the denominator and no ...\u2019s in the numerator....\u00a0...To fix this we will need to do partial fractions on this   transform.\u00a0 In this case the partial   fraction decomposition will be...\u00a0...Don\u2019t remember how to do partial fractions?\u00a0 In this example we\u2019ll show you one way of getting   the values of the constants and after this example we\u2019ll review how to get   the correct form of the partial fraction decomposition....\u00a0...Okay, so let\u2019s get the constants.\u00a0 There is a method for finding the constants   that will always work, however it can lead to more work than is sometimes   required.\u00a0 Eventually, we will need   that method, however in this case there is an easier way to find the   constants....\u00a0...Regardless of the method used, the first step is to   actually add the two terms back up.\u00a0   This gives the following....\u00a0...Now, this needs to be true for any ... that we should choose to put in.\u00a0 So, since the denominators are the same we   just need to get the numerators equal.\u00a0   Therefore, set the numerators equal....\u00a0...Again, this must be true for ANY value of ... that we want to put in.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take advantage of that.\u00a0 If it must be true for any value of ... then it must be true for ...,   to pick a value at random.\u00a0 In this   case we get,...\u00a0...We found ... by   appropriately picking ....\u00a0 We can ...   in the same way if we chose .......\u00a0...This will not always work, but when it does it will   usually simplify the work considerably....\u00a0...So, with these constants the transform becomes,...\u00a0...We can now easily do the inverse transform to get,...\u00a0...The last part of this example needed partial fractions to get the inverse transform.\u00a0 When we finally get back to differential equations and we start using ... transforms to solve them, you will quickly come to understand that partial fractions are a fact of life in these problems.\u00a0 Almost every problem will require partial fractions to one degree or another....\u00a0...Note that we could have done the last part of this example as we had done the previous two parts.\u00a0 If we had we would have gotten hyperbolic functions.\u00a0 However, recalling the ... of the hyperbolic functions we could have written the result in the form we got from the way we worked our problem.\u00a0 However, most students have a better feel for exponentials than they do for hyperbolic functions and so it\u2019s usually best to just use partial fractions and get the answer in terms of exponentials.\u00a0 It may be a little more work, but it will give a nicer (and easier to work with) form of the answer....\u00a0...Be warned that in my class I\u2019ve got a rule that if the denominator can be factored with integer coefficients then it must be....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s remind you how to get the correct partial fraction decomposition.\u00a0 The first step is to factor the denominator as much as possible.\u00a0 Then for each term in the denominator we will use the following table to get a term or terms for our partial fraction decomposition....\u00a0...\u00a0...Factor in...denominator...Term in partial...fraction   decomposition...\u00a0...Notice that the first and third cases are really special cases of the second and fourth cases respectively....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s do a couple more examples to remind you how to do partial fractions....\u00a0...Find   the inverse transform of each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here\u2019s the partial fraction decomposition for this part....\u00a0...Now, this time we won\u2019t go into quite the detail as we did   in the last example.\u00a0 We are after the   numerator of the partial fraction decomposition and this is usually easy   enough to do in

the partial fraction decomposition for this transform   is,...\u00a0...Now, in order to actually take the inverse transform we   will need to factor a 5 out of the denominator of the last term.\u00a0 The corrected transform as well as its   inverse transform is....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, for the first time we\u2019ve got a quadratic in the   denominator.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the decomposition   for this part....\u00a0...Setting numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Okay, in this case we could use ...\u00a0to quickly find ..., but that\u2019s all it would give.\u00a0   In this case we will need to go the \u201clong\u201d way around to getting the   constants.\u00a0 Note that this way will   always work, but is sometimes more work than is required....\u00a0...The \u201clong\u201d way is to completely multiply out the right   side and collect like terms....\u00a0...In order for these two to be equal the coefficients of the   ..., ... and the constants must all be equal.\u00a0 So, setting coefficients equal gives the   following system of equations that can be solved....\u00a0...Notice that I used ...   to denote the constants.\u00a0 This is habit   on my part and isn\u2019t really required, it\u2019s just what I\u2019m used to doing.\u00a0 Also, the coefficients are fairly messy   fractions in this case.\u00a0 Get used to   that.\u00a0 They will often be like this   when we get back into solving differential equations....\u00a0...There is a way to make our life a little easier as well   with this.\u00a0 Since all of the fractions   have a denominator of 47 we\u2019ll factor that out as we plug them back into the   decomposition.\u00a0 This will make dealing   with them much easier.\u00a0 The partial   fraction decomposition is then,...\u00a0...The inverse

partial fraction decomposition is...\u00a0...Setting numerators equal and multiplying out gives....\u00a0...Setting coefficients equal gives the following system....\u00a0...This system looks messy, but it\u2019s easier to solve than it   might look.\u00a0 First we get ... for free from the last   equation.\u00a0 We can then use the fourth   equation to find ....\u00a0 The third equation will then give ..., .......\u00a0...When plugging into the decomposition we\u2019ll get everything   with a denominator of 5, then factor that out as we did in the previous part   in order to make things easier to deal with....\u00a0...Note that we also factored a minus sign out of the last   two terms.\u00a0 To complete this part we\u2019ll   need to complete the square on the later term and fix up a couple of   numerators.\u00a0 Here\u2019s that work....\u00a0...The inverse transform is then....\u00a0...So, one final time.\u00a0 Partial fractions are a fact of life when using ... transforms to

conditions,...we will get...\u00a0...According to the theorem these should form a fundament set   of solutions.\u00a0 This is easy enough to check....\u00a0...So, we got a completely different set of fundamental solutions from the theorem than what we\u2019ve been using up to this point.\u00a0 This is not a problem.\u00a0 There are an infinite number of pairs of functions that we could use as a

If ... and ... are linearly dependent on I then ... = 0 for all ... in the interval I....\u00a0...Be very careful with this fact.\u00a0 It DOES NOT say that if ... = 0 then ... and ... are linearly dependent!\u00a0 In fact it is possible for two linearly independent functions to have a zero Wronskian!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This fact is used to quickly identify linearly independent functions and functions that are liable to be linearly dependent. ...\u00a0...Verify   the fact using the functions from the previous example....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case if we compute the Wronskian of the two   functions we should get zero since we have already determined that these   functions are linearly dependent....So, we get zero as we should have.\u00a0 Notice the heavy use of trig formulas to   simplify the work!...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Here we know that the two functions are linearly   independent and so we should get a non-zero Wronskian....The   Wronskian is non-zero as we expected provided ....\u00a0 This is not a problem.\u00a0 As long as the Wronskian is not identically   zero for all ... we are okay....\u00a0...\u00a0...Determine   if the following functions are linearly dependent or linearly independent....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...

We\u2019ll do the same thing here as we did in the first   part.\u00a0 Recall that...Now compute the Wronskian....\u00a0...Now, this does not say that the two functions are linearly   dependent!\u00a0 However, we can guess that   they probably are linearly dependent.\u00a0   To prove that they are in fact linearly dependent we\u2019ll need to write   down ...   and see if we can find non-zero ...   and ... that will make it true for   all .......\u00a0...So, it looks like we could use any constants that satisfy...to make this zero for all ....\u00a0 In particular we could   use...\u00a0...We have non-zero constants that will make the equation   true for all ....\u00a0 Therefore, the ...functions are linearly dependent....\u00a0...Before proceeding to the next topic in this section let\u2019s talk a little more about linearly independent and linearly dependent functions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off by assuming that ... and ... are linearly dependent.\u00a0 So, that means there are non-zero constants ... and ... so that ...is true for all .......\u00a0...Now, we can solve this in either of the following two ways....\u00a0...Note that this can be done because we know that ... and ... are non-zero and hence the divisions can be done without worrying about division by zero....\u00a0...So, this means that two linearly dependent functions can be written in such a way that one is nothing more than a constant times the other.\u00a0 Go back and look at both of the sets of linearly dependent functions that we wrote down and you will see that this is true for both of them....\u00a0...Two functions that are linearly independent can\u2019t be written in this manner and so we can\u2019t get from one to the other simply by multiplying by a constant....\u00a0...Next, we don\u2019t want to leave you with the impression that linear independence and linear dependence is only for two functions.\u00a0 We can easily extend the idea to as many functions as we\u2019d like....\u00a0...Let\u2019s suppose that we have ... non-zero functions, ....\u00a0 Write down the following equation....\u00a0...If we can find constants ... with at least two non-zero so that ... is true for all ... then we call the functions linearly dependent.\u00a0 If, on the other hand, the only constants that make ... true for ... are ... = 0 then we call the functions linearly independent....\u00a0...Note that unlike the two function case we can have some of the constants be zero and still have the functions be linearly dependent....\u00a0...In this case just what does it mean for the functions to be linearly dependent?\u00a0 Well, let\u2019s suppose that they are.\u00a0 So, this means that we can find constants, with at least two non-zero so that ... is true for all ....\u00a0 For the sake of argument let\u2019s suppose that ... is one of the non-zero constants.\u00a0 This means that we can do the following....\u00a0...In other words, if the functions are linearly dependent then we can write at least one of them in terms of the other functions....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s move on to the other topic of this section.\u00a0 There is an alternate method of computing the Wronskian.\u00a0 The following theorem gives this alternate method....\u00a0...If\u00a0 ...   and ... are two   solutions to\u00a0 ...then the Wronskian of the two solutions is...for some .......\u00a0...Because we don\u2019t know the Wronskian and we don\u2019t know ... this won\u2019t do us a lot of good apparently.\u00a0 However, we can rewrite this as ...where the original Wronskian sitting in front of the exponential is absorbed into the ... and the evaluation of the integral at ... will put a constant in the exponential that can also be brought out and absorbed into the constant ....\u00a0 If you don\u2019t recall how to do this go back and take a look at the linear, first order differential equation ... as we did something similar there....\u00a0...With this rewrite we can compute the Wronskian up to a multiplicative constant, which isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 Notice as well that we don\u2019t actually need the two solutions to do this.\u00a0 All we need is the coefficient of the first derivative from the differential equation (provided the coefficient of the second derivative is one of course\u2026)....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a quick example of this....\u00a0...Without   solving, determine the Wronskian of two solutions to the following   differential equation....The first thing that we need to do is divide the   differential equation by the coefficient of the second derivative as that   needs to be a one.\u00a0 This gives us...Now, using ...   the Wronskian is", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Wronskian.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Differential Equations - More on the  Wronskian", "subject": "math"}},

vibrations.\u00a0 In particular we are going to look at a mass that is hanging from a spring....\u00a0...Vibrations can occur in pretty much all branches of engineering and so what we\u2019re going to be doing here can be easily adapted to other situations, usually with just a change in notation....\u00a0...Let\u2019s get the situation setup.\u00a0 We are going to start with a spring of length ..., called the natural length, and we\u2019re going to hook an object with mass ... up to it.\u00a0 When the object is attached to the spring the spring will stretch a length of ....\u00a0 We will call the equilibrium position the position of the center of gravity for the object as it hangs on the spring with no movement....\u00a0...Below is sketch of the spring with and without the object attached to it....\u00a0...As denoted in the sketch we are going to assume that all forces, velocities, and displacements in the downward direction will be positive.\u00a0 All forces, velocities, and displacements in the upward direction will be negative....\u00a0...Also, as shown in the sketch above, we will measure all displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\u00a0 Therefore, the ... = 0 position will correspond to the center of gravity for the mass as it hangs on the spring and is at rest (... no movement)....\u00a0...Now, we need to develop a differential equation that will give the displacement of the object at any time ....\u00a0 First, recall ...\u2019s Second Law of Motion....In this case we will use the second derivative of the displacement, ..., for the acceleration and so ...\u2019s Second Law becomes,...\u00a0...We now need to determine all the forces that will act upon the object.\u00a0 There are four forces that we will assume act upon the object.\u00a0 Two that will always act on the object and two that may or may not act upon the object.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a list of the forces that will act upon the object....\u00a0...The force due to gravity will always act upon the object of course.\u00a0 This force is...We are going to assume that Hooke\u2019s Law will govern the force that the spring exerts on the object.\u00a0 This force will always be present as well and is...\u00a0...Hooke\u2019s Law tells us that the force exerted by a spring will be the spring constant, ..., times the displacement of the spring from its natural length.\u00a0 For our set up the displacement from the spring's natural length is ... and the minus sign is in there to make sure that the force always has the correct direction....\u00a0...Let\u2019s make sure that this force does what we expect it to.\u00a0 If the object is at rest in its equilibrium position the displacement is ... and the force is simply ... which will act in the upward position as it should since the spring has been stretched from its natural length....\u00a0...If the spring has been stretched further down from the equilibrium position then ...\u00a0will be positive and ... will be negative acting to pull the object back up as it should be....\u00a0...Next, if the object has been moved up past its equilibrium point, but not yet to its natural length then ... will be negative, but still less than ... and so ... will be positive and once again ... will be negative acting to pull the object up....\u00a0...Finally, if the object has been moved upwards so that the spring is now compressed, then ... will be negative and greater than ....\u00a0 Therefore, ... will be negative and now ... will be positive acting to push the object down....\u00a0...So, it looks like this force will act as we expect that it should....\u00a0...The next force that we need to consider is damping.\u00a0 This force may or may not be present for any given problem....\u00a0...Dampers work to counteract any movement.\u00a0 There are several ways to define a damping force.\u00a0 The one that we\u2019ll use is the following....where, ... is the damping coefficient.\u00a0 Let\u2019s think for a minute about how this force will act.\u00a0 If the object is moving downward, then the velocity (...) will be positive and so ... will be negative and acting to pull the object back up.\u00a0 Likewise, if the object is moving upward, the velocity (...) will be negative and so ... will be positive and acting to push the object back down.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In other words, the damping force as we\u2019ve defined it will always act to counter the current motion of the object and so will act to damp out any motion in the object....This is the catch all force.\u00a0 If there are any other forces that we decide we want to act on our object we lump them in here and call it good.\u00a0 We typically call ... the forcing function....\u00a0...Putting all of these together gives us the following for ...\u2019s Second Law....\u00a0...Or, upon rewriting, we get,...\u00a0...Now, when the object is at rest in its equilibrium position there are exactly two forces acting on the object, the force due to gravity and the force due to the spring.\u00a0 Also, since the object is at rest (... not moving) these two forces must be canceling each other out.\u00a0 This means that we must have,...\u00a0...Using this in ...\u2019s Second Law gives us the final version of the differential equation that we\u2019ll work

reduced to,...where, ...and ... is called the natural frequency.\u00a0 Recall as well that ... and ... and so we can guarantee that this quantity will be complex. The solution in this case is then\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We can write ... in the following form,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...where ... is the amplitude of the displacement and ...\u00a0is the phase shift or phase angle of the displacement....\u00a0...When the displacement is in the form of ... it is usually easier to work with.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s easier to find the constants in ... from the initial conditions than it is to find the amplitude and phase shift in ... from the initial conditions.\u00a0 So, in order to get the equation into the

determine ...and...?\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with ... and use a trig identity to write it as...\u00a0...Now, ...and...\u00a0are constants and so if we compare ... to ... we can see that...\u00a0...We

with...\u00a0...Taking the inverse tangent of both sides gives,...\u00a0...Before we work any examples let\u2019s talk a little bit about units of mass and the British vs. metric system differences....\u00a0...Recall that the weight of the object is given by...where ... is the mass of the object and ... is the gravitational acceleration.\u00a0 For the examples in this problem we\u2019ll be using the following values for .......\u00a0...This is not the standard 32.2 ft/s... or 9.81 m/s..., but using these will make some of the numbers come out a little nicer....\u00a0...In the metric system the mass of objects is given in kilograms (...) and there is nothing for us to do.\u00a0 However, in the British system we tend to be given the weight of an object in pounds (yes, pounds are the units of weight not mass\u2026) and so we\u2019ll need to compute the mass for these problems....\u00a0...At this point we should probably work an example of all this to see how this stuff works. ...\u00a0...A   16 lb object stretches a spring ...\u00a0ft by itself.\u00a0 There is no damping and no external forces   acting on the system.\u00a0 The spring is   initially displaced 6 inches upwards from its equilibrium position and given   an initial velocity of 1 ft/sec downward.\u00a0   Find the displacement at any time ...,   .......\u00a0...We first need to set up the IVP for the problem.\u00a0 This requires us to get our hands on ... and ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is the British system so we\u2019ll need to compute the   mass....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s get ....\u00a0 We can use the fact that ... to find ....\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget that we\u2019ll   need all of our length units the same.\u00a0   We\u2019ll use feet for the unit of measurement for this problem....\u00a0...We can now set up the IVP....\u00a0...For the initial conditions recall that upward   displacement/motion is negative while downward displacement/motion is   positive.\u00a0 Also, since we decided to do   everything in feet we had to convert the initial displacement to feet....\u00a0...Now, to solve this we can either go through the   characteristic equation or we can just jump straight to the formula that we   derived above.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do it that   way.\u00a0 First, we need the natural   frequency,...\u00a0...The general solution, along with its derivative, is then,...\u00a0...Applying the initial conditions gives...\u00a0...The displacement at any time ... is then...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s convert this to a single cosine.\u00a0 First let\u2019s get the amplitude, .......\u00a0...You can use either the exact value here or a decimal   approximation.\u00a0 Often the decimal   approximation will be easier....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s get the phase shift....\u00a0...We need to be careful with this part.\u00a0 The phase angle found above is in Quadrant   IV, but there is also an angle in Quadrant II that would work as well.\u00a0 We get this second angle by adding ...\u00a0onto the first angle.\u00a0 So, we actually have two angles.\u00a0 They are...\u00a0...We need to decide which of these phase shifts is correct,   because only one will be correct.\u00a0 To   do this recall that...\u00a0...Now, since we are assuming that ... is positive this means that the sign of cos...\u00a0 will be the same as the sign of ... and the sign of sin...\u00a0 will be the same as the sign of ....\u00a0 So, for this particular case we must have   cos... and sin....\u00a0 This means that the phase shift must be in   Quadrant II and so the second angle is the one that we need....\u00a0...So, after all of this the displacement at any time ... is....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the displacement for the first 5   seconds....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at a slightly more realistic situation.\u00a0 No vibration will go on forever.\u00a0 So let\u2019s add in a damper and see what happens now....\u00a0...We are still going to assume that there will be no external forces acting on the system, with the exception of damping of course.\u00a0 In this case the differential equation will be....where ..., ..., and ... are all positive constants.\u00a0 Upon solving for the roots of the characteristic equation we get the following....\u00a0...We will have three cases here....\u00a0...1....In this case we will get a double root out of the characteristic equation and the displacement at any time ... will be....\u00a0...Notice that as ...\u00a0the displacement will approach zero and so the damping in this case will do what it\u2019s supposed to do....\u00a0...This case is called ... and will happen when the damping coefficient is,...\u00a0...The value of the damping coefficient that gives critical damping is called the critical damping coefficient and denoted by .......\u00a0...2....In this case let\u2019s rewrite the roots a little....\u00a0...Also notice that from our initial assumption that we have,...\u00a0...Using this we can see that the fraction under the square root above is less than one.\u00a0 Then if the quantity under the square root is less than one, this means that the square root of this quantity is also going to be less than one.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...Why is this important?\u00a0 Well, the quantity in the parenthesis is now one plus/minus a number that is less than one.\u00a0 This means that the quantity in the parenthesis is guaranteed to be positive and so the two roots in this case are guaranteed to be negative.\u00a0 Therefore the displacement at any time ... is,...and will approach zero as ....\u00a0 So, once again the damper does what it is supposed to do....\u00a0...This case will occur when...and is called ...\u00a0...3....In this case we will get complex roots out of the characteristic equation....where the real part is guaranteed to be negative and so the displacement is...\u00a0...Notice that we reduced the sine and cosine down to a single cosine in this case as we did in the undamped case.\u00a0 Also, since ... the displacement will approach zero as ...\u00a0and the damper will also work as it\u2019s supposed to in this case....\u00a0...We will get this case will occur when...and is called ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples here with damping....\u00a0...Take   the spring and mass system from the first example and attach a damper to it   that will exert a force of 12 lbs when the velocity is 2 ft/s.\u00a0 Find the displacement at any time ..., .......\u00a0...The mass and spring constant were already found in the   first example so we won\u2019t do the work here.\u00a0   We do need to find the damping coefficient however.\u00a0 To do this we will use the formula for the   damping force given above with one modification.\u00a0 The original damping force formula is,...\u00a0...However, remember that the force and the velocity are   always acting in opposite directions.\u00a0   So, if the velocity is upward (...   negative) the force will be downward (...   positive) and so the minus in the formula will cancel against the minus in   the velocity.\u00a0 Likewise, if the   velocity is downward (...   positive) the force will be upwards (...   negative) and in this case the minus sign in the formula will cancel against   the minus in the force.\u00a0 In other   words, we can drop the minus sign in the formula and use...and then just ignore any signs for the force and velocity....\u00a0...Doing this gives us the following for the damping   coefficient...\u00a0...The IVP for this example is then,...\u00a0...Before solving let\u2019s check to see what kind of damping   we\u2019ve got.\u00a0 To do this all we need is the   critical damping coefficient....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got critical damping.\u00a0 Note that this means that when we go to   solve the differential equation we should get a double root....\u00a0...Speaking of solving, let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave the details to you to check that   the displacement at any time ... is....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the displacement during the first 3   seconds....\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that the \u201cvibration\u201d in the system is not really a true vibration as we tend to think of them.\u00a0 In the critical damping case there isn\u2019t going to be a real oscillation about the equilibrium point that we tend to associate with vibrations.\u00a0 The damping in this system is strong enough to force the \u201cvibration\u201d to die out before it ever really gets a chance to do much in the way of oscillation....\u00a0...Take   the spring and mass system from the first example and this time let\u2019s attach   a damper to it that will exert a force of 17 lbs when the velocity is 2   ft/s.\u00a0 Find the displacement at any   time ..., .......\u00a0...So, the only difference between this example and the   previous example is damping force.\u00a0 So   let\u2019s find the damping coefficient...\u00a0...So it looks like we\u2019ve got over damping this time around   so we should expect to get two real distinct roots from the characteristic   equation and they should both be negative.\u00a0   The IVP for this example is,...\u00a0...This one\u2019s a little messier than the previous example so   we\u2019ll do a couple of the steps, leaving it to you to fill in the blanks.\u00a0 The roots of the characteristic equation   are...\u00a0...In this case it will be easier to just convert to decimals   and go that route.\u00a0 Note that, as   predicted we got two real, distinct and negative roots.\u00a0 The general and actual solution for this   example are then,...\u00a0...Here\u2019s a sketch of the displacement for this example....\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice an interesting thing here about the displacement here.\u00a0 Even though we are \u201cover\u201d damped in this case, it actually takes longer for the vibration to die out than in the critical damping case.\u00a0 Sometimes this happens, although it will not always be the case that over damping will allow the vibration to continue longer than the critical damping case.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also notice that, as with the critical damping case, we don\u2019t get a vibration in the sense that we usually think of them.\u00a0 Again, the damping is strong enough to force the vibration do die out quick enough so that we don\u2019t see much, if any, of the oscillation that we typically associate with vibrations....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at one more example before moving on the next type of vibrations....\u00a0...Take   the spring and mass system from the first example and for this example let\u2019s   attach a damper to it that will exert a force of 5 lbs when the velocity is 2   ft/s.\u00a0 Find the displacement at any   time ..., .......\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get the damping coefficient....\u00a0...So it\u2019s under damping this time.\u00a0 That shouldn\u2019t be too surprising given the   first two examples. The IVP for this example is,...\u00a0...In this case the roots of the characteristic equation are...\u00a0...They are complex as we expected to get since we are in the   under damped case.\u00a0 The general   solution and actual solution are...\u00a0...Let\u2019s convert this to a single cosine as we did in the   undamped case....\u00a0...As with the undamped case we can use the coefficients of   the cosine and the sine to determine which phase shift that we should   use.\u00a0 The coefficient of the cosine (... is negative and so cos... must   also be negative.\u00a0 Likewise, the   coefficient of the sine (...   is also negative and so sin...\u00a0   must also be negative.\u00a0 This   means that ...\u00a0must be in the Quadrant III and so the   second angle is the one that we want....\u00a0...The displacement is then...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of this displacement....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case we finally got what we usually consider to be a true vibration.\u00a0 In fact that is the point of critical damping.\u00a0 As we increase the damping coefficient, the critical damping coefficient will be the first one in which a true oscillation in the displacement will not occur.\u00a0 For all values of the damping coefficient larger than this (... over damping) we will also not see a true oscillation in the displacement....\u00a0...From a physical standpoint critical (and over) damping is usually preferred to under damping.\u00a0 Think of the shock absorbers in your car.\u00a0 When you hit a bump you don\u2019t want to spend the next few minutes bouncing up and down while the vibration set up by the bump die out.\u00a0 You would like there to be as little movement as possible.\u00a0 In other words, you will want to set up the shock absorbers in your car so get at the least critical damping so that you can avoid the oscillations that will arise from an under damped case....\u00a0...It\u2019s now time to look at systems in which we allow other external forces to act on the object in the system....\u00a0...\u00a0We will first take a look at the undamped case.\u00a0 The differential equation in this case is...\u00a0...This is just a nonhomogeneous differential equation and we know how to solve these.\u00a0 The general solution will be...where the complementary solution is the solution to the free, undamped vibration case.\u00a0 To get the particular solution we can use either undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters depending on which we find easier for a given forcing function....\u00a0...There is a particular type of forcing function that we should take a look at since it leads to some interesting results.\u00a0 Let\u2019s suppose that the forcing function is a simple periodic function of the form...\u00a0...For the purposes of this discussion we\u2019ll use the first one.\u00a0 Using this, the IVP becomes,...\u00a0...The complementary solution, as pointed out above, is just...where ...\u00a0is the natural frequency.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will need to be careful in finding a particular solution.\u00a0 The reason for this will be clear if we use undetermined coefficients.\u00a0 With undetermined coefficients our guess for the form of the particular solution would be,...\u00a0...Now, this guess will be problems if ....\u00a0 If this were to happen the guess for the particular solution is exactly the complementary solution and so we\u2019d need to add in a ....\u00a0 Of course if we don\u2019t have ...\u00a0then there will be nothing wrong with the guess....\u00a0...So, we will need to look at this in two cases....\u00a0...In this case our initial guess is okay since it won\u2019t be the complementary solution.\u00a0 Upon differentiating the guess and plugging it into the differential equation and simplifying we get,...\u00a0...Setting coefficients equal gives us,...\u00a0...The particular solution is then...\u00a0...Note that we rearranged things a little.\u00a0 Depending on the form that you\u2019d like the displacement to be in we can have either of the following....\u00a0...If we used the sine form of the forcing function we could get a similar formula....\u00a0...In this case we will need to add in a ... to the guess for the particular solution....\u00a0...Note that we went ahead and acknowledge that ...\u00a0in our guess.\u00a0 Acknowledging this will help with some simplification that we\u2019ll need to do later on.\u00a0 Differentiating our guess, plugging it into the differential equation and simplifying gives us the following....\u00a0...Before setting coefficients equal, let\u2019s remember the definition of the natural frequency and note that...\u00a0...So, the first two terms actually drop out (which is a very good thing\u2026) and this gives us,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s set coefficient equal....\u00a0...In this case the particular will be,...\u00a0...The displacement for this case is then...depending on the form that you prefer for the displacement....\u00a0...So, what was the point of the two cases here?\u00a0 Well in the first case, ...\u00a0our displacement function consists of two cosines and is nice and well behaved for all time.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In contrast, the second case, ...\u00a0\u00a0will have some serious issues at ... increases.\u00a0 The addition of the ... in the particular solution will mean that we are going to see an oscillation that grows in amplitude as ... increases.\u00a0 This case is called ... and we would generally like to avoid this at all costs....\u00a0...In this case resonance arose by assuming that the forcing function was,...\u00a0...We would also have the possibility of resonance if we assumed a forcing function of the form....\u00a0...We should also take care to not assume that a forcing function will be in one of these two forms.\u00a0 Forcing functions can come in a wide variety of forms.\u00a0 If we do run into a forcing function different from the one that used here you will have to go through undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters to determine the particular solution....\u00a0...A   3 kg object is attached to spring and will stretch the spring 392 mm by   itself.\u00a0 There is no damping in the   system and a forcing function of the form...is attached to the object and the system will experience   resonance.\u00a0 If the object is initially   displaced 20 cm downward from its equilibrium position and given a velocity   of 10 cm/sec upward find the displacement at any time .......\u00a0...Since we are in the metric system we won\u2019t need to find   mass as it\u2019s been given to us.\u00a0 Also,   for all calculations we\u2019ll be converting all lengths over to meters.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first thing we need to do is find .......\u00a0...Now, we are told that the system experiences resonance so   let\u2019s go ahead and get the natural frequency so we can completely set up the   IVP....\u00a0...The IVP for this is then...\u00a0...Solution wise there isn\u2019t a whole lot to do here.\u00a0 The complementary solution is the free   undamped solution which is easy to get and for the particular solution we can   just use the formula that we derived above....\u00a0...The general solution is then,...\u00a0...Applying the initial conditions gives the displacement at   any time ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave the details to you to check....\u00a0...The last thing that we\u2019ll do is combine the first two   terms into a single cosine....\u00a0...In this case the coefficient of the cosine is positive and   the coefficient of the sine is negative.\u00a0   This forces cos...\u00a0   to be positive and sin...\u00a0   to be negative.\u00a0 This means that   the phase shift needs to be in Quadrant IV and so the first one is the   correct phase shift this time....\u00a0...The displacement then becomes,...Here is a sketch of the displacement for this example....\u00a0...\u00a0...It\u2019s now time to look at the final vibration case....\u00a0...This is the full blown case where we consider every last possible force that can act upon the system.\u00a0 The differential equation for this case is,...The displacement function this time will be,...where the complementary solution will be the solution to the free, damped case and the particular solution will be found using undetermined coefficients or variation of parameter, whichever is most convenient to use....\u00a0...There are a couple of things to note here about this case.\u00a0 First, from our work back in the free, damped case we know that the complementary solution will approach zero as ... increases.\u00a0 Because of this the complementary solution is often called the ... in this case....\u00a0...Also, because of this behavior the displacement will start to look more and more like the particular solution as ... increases and so the particular solution is often called the ... or .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one final example before leaving this section.\u00a0 As with the previous examples, we\u2019re going to leave most of the details out for you to check....\u00a0...Take   the system from the last example and add in a damper that will exert a force   of 45 ...   when then velocity is 50 cm/sec....\u00a0...So, all we need to do is compute the damping coefficient   for this problem then pull everything else down from the previous   problem.\u00a0 The damping coefficient is...The IVP for this problem is....\u00a0...The complementary solution for this example is...\u00a0...For the particular solution we the form will be,...\u00a0...Plugging this into the differential equation and   simplifying gives us,...\u00a0...Setting coefficient equal gives,...The general solution is then...\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the displacement for this example....\u00a0", "url":

into the general form of the solution gives the following solutions to the differential equation....\u00a0...Now, these two functions are \u201cnice enough\u201d (there\u2019s those words again\u2026 we\u2019ll get around to defining them ...) to form the general solution.\u00a0 We do have a problem however.\u00a0 Since we started with only real numbers in our differential equation we would like our solution to only involve real numbers.\u00a0 The two solutions above are complex and so we would like to get our hands on a couple of solutions (\u201cnice enough\u201d of course\u2026) that are real....\u00a0...To do this we\u2019ll need Euler\u2019s Formula....\u00a0...A nice variant of Euler\u2019s Formula that we\u2019ll need is....\u00a0...Now, split up our two solutions into

a general solution....\u00a0...So, if the roots of the characteristic equation happen to be ...\u00a0the general solution to the differential equation is....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples now....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....The characteristic equation for this differential equation   is....The roots of this equation are ....\u00a0 The general solution to the differential   equation is then....\u00a0...Now, you\u2019ll note that we didn\u2019t differentiate this right   away as we did in the last section.\u00a0   The reason for this is simple.\u00a0   While the differentiation is not terribly difficult, it can get a   little messy.\u00a0 So, first looking at the   initial conditions we can see from the first one that if we just applied it   we would get the following....\u00a0...In other words, the first term will drop out in order to   meet the first condition.\u00a0 This makes   the solution, along with its derivative...\u00a0...A much nicer derivative than if we\u2019d done the original solution.\u00a0 Now, apply the second initial condition to   the derivative to get....\u00a0...The actual solution is then....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....The characteristic equation this time is....\u00a0...\u00a0...The roots of this are ....\u00a0 The general solution as well as its   derivative is...\u00a0...Notice that this time we will need the derivative from the   start as we won\u2019t be having one of the terms drop out.\u00a0 Applying the initial conditions gives the   following system....\u00a0...Solving this system gives ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The actual solution to the IVP is then....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....The characteristic equation this time is....\u00a0...The roots of this are ....\u00a0 The

is one of the more common mistakes   that students make on these problems.\u00a0   Also, make sure that you evaluate the trig functions as much as   possible in these cases.\u00a0 It will only   make your life simpler.\u00a0 Solving this   system gives...\u00a0...The actual solution to the IVP is then....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do one final example before moving on to the next topic....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....The characteristic equation for this differential equation   and its roots are....\u00a0...The general solution to this differential equation and its   derivative is....\u00a0...Plugging in the initial conditions gives the following   system....\u00a0...So, the constants drop right out with this system and the   actual solution is.", "url":

differential equation is in the form....\u00a0...In fact, we will rarely look at non-constant coefficient linear second order differential equations.\u00a0 In the case where we assume constant coefficients we will use the following differential equation....\u00a0...Where possible we will use ... just to make the point that certain facts, theorems, properties, and/or techniques can be used with the non-constant form.\u00a0 However, most of the time we will be using ... as it can be fairly difficult to solve second order non-constant coefficient differential equations.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Initially we will make our life easier by looking at differential equations with ... = 0.\u00a0 When ... = 0 we call the differential equation ... and when ...\u00a0we call the differential equation ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start thinking about how to go about solving a constant coefficient, homogeneous, linear, second order differential equation.\u00a0 Here is the general constant coefficient, homogeneous, linear, second order differential equation....\u00a0...It\u2019s probably best to start off with an example.\u00a0 This example will lead us to a very important fact that we will use in every problem from this point on.\u00a0 The example will also give us clues into how to go about solving these in general. ...\u00a0...Determine   some solutions to...We can get some solutions here simply by inspection.\u00a0 We need functions whose second derivative   is 9 times the original function.\u00a0 One   of the first functions that I can think of that comes back to itself after   two derivatives is an exponential function and with proper exponents the 9   will get taken care of as well....\u00a0...So, it looks like the following two functions are   solutions....\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that these are in fact   solutions.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...These two functions are not the only solutions to the   differential equation

a linear, homogeneous   differential equation then so is...\u00a0...Note that we didn\u2019t include the restriction of constant coefficient or second order in this.\u00a0 This will work for any linear homogeneous differential equation....\u00a0...If we further assume second order and one other condition (which we\u2019ll give in a second) we can go a step further....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are two solutions to a linear, second order homogeneous differential equation and they are \u201cnice enough\u201d then the general solution to the linear, second order differential equation is given by ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, just what do we mean by \u201cnice enough\u201d?\u00a0 We\u2019ll hold off on that until a later ....\u00a0 At this point you\u2019ll hopefully believe it when we say that specific functions are \u201cnice enough\u201d....\u00a0...So, if we now make the assumption that we are dealing with a linear, second order differential equation, we now know that ... will be its general solution.\u00a0 The next question that we can ask is how to find the constants ... and ....\u00a0 Since we have two constants it makes sense, hopefully, that we will need two equations, or conditions, to find them....\u00a0...One way to do this is to specify the value of the solution at two distinct points, or,...\u00a0...These are typically called boundary values and are not really the focus of this course so we won\u2019t be working with them....\u00a0...Another way to find the constants would be to specify the value of the solution and its derivative at a particular point.\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...These are the two conditions that we\u2019ll be using here.\u00a0 As with the first order differential equations these will be called initial conditions....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....First, the two functions...are \u201cnice enough\u201d for us to form the general solution to   the differential equation.\u00a0 At this   point, please just believe this.\u00a0 You   will be able to verify this for yourself in a couple of sections....\u00a0...The general solution to our differential equation is then...\u00a0...Now all we need to do is apply the initial   conditions.\u00a0 This means that we need   the derivative of the solution....\u00a0...Plug in the initial conditions...\u00a0...This gives us a system of two equations and two unknowns   that can be solved.\u00a0 Doing this yields...\u00a0...The solution to the IVP is then,...\u00a0...Up to this point we\u2019ve only looked at a single differential equation and we got its solution by inspection.\u00a0 For a rare few differential equations we can do this.\u00a0 However, for the vast majority of the second order differential equations out there we will be unable to do this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we would like a method for arriving at the two solutions we will need in order to form a general solution that will work for any linear, constant coefficient, second order differential equation.\u00a0 This is easier than it might initially look.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will use the solutions we found in the first example as a guide.\u00a0 All of the solutions in this example were in the form ...\u00a0...Note, that we didn\u2019t include a constant in front of it since we can literally include any constant that we want and still get a solution.\u00a0 The important idea here is to get the exponential function.\u00a0 Once we have that we can add on constants to our hearts content....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s assume that all solutions to...will be of the form...\u00a0...To see if we are correct all we need to do is plug this into the differential equation and see what happens.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s get some derivatives and then plug in....\u00a0...So, if ... is to be a solution to ... then the following must be true...\u00a0...This can be reduced further by noting that exponentials are never zero.\u00a0 Therefore, ... will be a solution to ... provided ... is a solution to ...\u00a0...This equation is typically called the ... for .......\u00a0...Okay, so how do we use this to find solutions to a linear, constant coefficient, second order differential equation?\u00a0 First write down the characteristic equation, ..., for the differential equation, ....\u00a0 This will be a quadratic equation and so we should expect two roots, ... and ....\u00a0 Once we have these two roots we have two solutions to the differential equation....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a quick example....\u00a0...Find   two solutions to...This is the same differential equation that we looked at   in the first example.\u00a0 This time   however, let\u2019s not just guess.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   go through the process as outlined above to see the functions that we guess   above are the same as the functions the process gives us....\u00a0...First write down the characteristic equation for this   differential equation and solve it....\u00a0...The two roots are 3 and -3.\u00a0 Therefore, two solutions are...\u00a0...These match up with the first guesses that we made in the   first example....\u00a0...You\u2019ll notice that we neglected to mention whether or not the two solutions listed in ... are in fact \u201cnice enough\u201d to form the general solution to ....\u00a0 This was intentional.\u00a0 We have three cases that we need to look at and this will be addressed differently in each of these cases....\u00a0...So, what are the cases?\u00a0 As we previously noted the characteristic equation is quadratic and so will have two roots, ... and ....\u00a0 The roots will have three possible forms.\u00a0 These are...\u00a0...\u00a0...The next three sections will look at each of these in some more depth, including giving forms for the solution that will

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we will take a look at the first method that can be used to find a particular solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation....\u00a0...One of the main advantages of this method is that it reduces the problem down to an algebra problem.\u00a0 The algebra can get messy on occasion, but for most of the problems it will not be terribly difficult.\u00a0 Another nice thing about this method is that the complementary solution will not be explicitly required, although as we will see knowledge of the complementary solution will be needed in some cases and so we\u2019ll generally find that as well....\u00a0...There are two disadvantages to this method.\u00a0 First, it will only work for a fairly small class of ...\u2019s.\u00a0 The class of ...\u2019s for which the method works, does include some of the more common functions, however, there are many functions out there for which undetermined coefficients simply won\u2019t work.\u00a0 Second, it is generally only useful for constant coefficient differential equations....\u00a0...The method is quite simple.\u00a0 All that we need to do is look at ... and make a guess as to the form of ... leaving the coefficient(s) undetermined (and hence the name of the method).\u00a0 Plug the guess into the differential equation and see if we can determine values of the coefficients.\u00a0 If we can determine values for the coefficients then we guessed correctly, if we can\u2019t find values for the coefficients then we guessed incorrectly....\u00a0...It\u2019s usually easier to see this method in action rather than to try and describe it, so let\u2019s jump into some examples....\u00a0...Determine   a particular solution to...\u00a0...The point here is to find a particular solution, however   the first thing that we\u2019re going to do is find the complementary solution to   this differential equation.\u00a0 Recall   that the complementary solution comes from solving,...\u00a0...The characteristic equation for this differential equation   and its roots are....\u00a0...The complementary solution is then,...\u00a0...At this point the reason for doing this first will not be   apparent, however we want you in the habit of finding it before we start the   work to find a particular solution.\u00a0 Eventually,   as we\u2019ll see, having the complementary solution in hand will be helpful and   so it\u2019s best to be in the habit of finding it first prior to doing the work   for undetermined coefficients....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s proceed with finding a particular   solution.\u00a0 As mentioned prior to the   start of this example we need to make a guess as to the form of a particular   solution to this differential equation.\u00a0   Since ... is an exponential   and we know that exponentials never just appear or disappear in the   differentiation process it seems that a likely form of the particular   solution would be...\u00a0...Now, all that we need to do is do a couple of derivatives,   plug this into the differential equation and see if we can determine what ... needs to be.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Plugging into the differential equation gives...\u00a0...So, in order for our guess to be a solution we will need   to choose ... so that the   coefficients of the exponentials on either side of the equal sign are the   same.\u00a0 In other words we need to choose   ... so that,...\u00a0...Okay, we found a value for the coefficient.\u00a0 This means that we guessed correctly.\u00a0 A particular solution to the differential   equation is then,...\u00a0...Before proceeding any further let\u2019s again note that we started off the solution above by finding the complementary solution.\u00a0 This is not technically part the method of Undetermined Coefficients however, as we\u2019ll eventually see, having this in hand before we make our guess for the particular solution can save us a lot of work and/or headache.\u00a0 Finding the complementary solution first is simply a good habit to have so we\u2019ll try to get you in the habit over the course of the next few examples.\u00a0 At this point do not worry about why it is a good habit.\u00a0 We\u2019ll eventually see why it is a good habit....\u00a0...Now, back to the work at hand.\u00a0 Notice in the last example that we kept saying \u201ca\u201d particular solution, not \u201cthe\u201d particular solution.\u00a0 This is because there are other possibilities out there for the particular solution we\u2019ve just managed to find one of them.\u00a0 Any of them will work when it comes to writing down the general solution to the differential equation....\u00a0...Speaking of which\u2026\u00a0 This section is devoted to finding particular solutions and most of the examples will be finding only the particular solution.\u00a0 However, we should do at least one full blown IVP to make sure that we can say that we\u2019ve done one....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP...We know that the general solution will be of the form,...and we already have both the complementary and particular solution   from the first example so we don\u2019t really need to do any extra work for this   problem.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...One of the more common mistakes in these problems is to   find the complementary solution and then, because we\u2019re probably in the habit   of doing it, apply the initial conditions to the complementary solution to   find the constants.\u00a0 This however, is   incorrect.\u00a0 The complementary solution   is only the solution to the homogeneous differential equation and we are   after a solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation and the initial   conditions must satisfy that solution instead of the complementary solution....\u00a0...So, we need the general solution to the nonhomogeneous   differential equation.\u00a0 Taking the   complementary solution and the particular solution that we found in the   previous example we get the following for a general solution and its   derivative....\u00a0...Now, apply the initial conditions to these....\u00a0...Solving this system gives ... = 2 and ...   = 1.\u00a0 The actual solution is then....\u00a0...This will be the only IVP in this section so don\u2019t forget how these are done for nonhomogeneous differential equations!...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example that will give the second type of ... for which undetermined coefficients will work....\u00a0...Find   a particular solution for the following differential equation....\u00a0...Differentiating and plugging into the differential   equation gives,...\u00a0...Collecting like terms yields...\u00a0...We need to pick ...   so that we get the same function on both sides of the equal sign.\u00a0 This means that the coefficients of the   sines and cosines must be equal.\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...Notice two things.\u00a0   First, since there is no cosine on the right hand side this means that   the coefficient must be zero on that side.\u00a0   More importantly we have a serious problem here.\u00a0 In order for the cosine to drop out, as it   must in order for the guess to satisfy the differential equation, we need to   set ... = 0, but if ... = 0, the sine will also drop out and   that can\u2019t happen.\u00a0 Likewise, choosing ... to keep the sine around will also   keep the cosine around....\u00a0...What this means is that our initial guess was wrong.\u00a0 If we get multiple values of the same   constant or are unable to find the value of a constant then we have guessed   wrong. ...\u00a0...One of the nicer aspects of this method is that when we   guess wrong our work will often suggest a fix.\u00a0 In this case the problem was the cosine   that cropped up.\u00a0 So, to counter this   let\u2019s add a cosine to our guess.\u00a0 Our   new guess is...\u00a0...Plugging this into the differential equation and   collecting like terms gives,...\u00a0...Now, set the coefficients equal...\u00a0...Solving this system gives us...\u00a0...We found constants and this time we guessed   correctly.\u00a0 A particular solution to   the differential equation is then,...\u00a0...Notice that if we had had a cosine instead of a sine in the last example then our guess would have been the same.\u00a0 In fact, if both a sine and a cosine had shown up we will see that the same guess will also work....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at the third and final type of basic ... that we can have.\u00a0 There are other types of ... that we can have, but as we will see they will all come back to two types that we\u2019ve already done as well as the next one....\u00a0...Find   a particular solution for the following differential equation....Once, again we will generally want the complementary   solution in hand first, but again we\u2019re working with the same homogeneous   differential equation (you\u2019ll eventually see why we keep working with the   same homogeneous problem) so we\u2019ll again just refer to the first example....\u00a0...For this example ...   is a cubic polynomial.\u00a0 For this we   will need the following guess for the particular solution....\u00a0...Notice that even though ... doesn\u2019t have a ...   in it our guess will still need one!\u00a0   So, differentiate and plug into the differential equation....\u00a0...Now, as we\u2019ve done in the previous examples we will need   the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equal sign to be the same   so set coefficients equal and solve....\u00a0...Notice that in this case it was very easy to solve for the   constants.\u00a0 The first equation gave ....\u00a0   Then once we knew ... the   second equation gave ..., ....\u00a0   A particular solution for this differential equation is then...\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve gone over the three basic kinds of functions that we can use undetermined coefficients on let\u2019s summarize....\u00a0... guess... degree polynomial... ...\u00a0...Notice that there are really only three kinds of functions given above.\u00a0 If you think about it the single cosine and single sine functions are really special cases of the case where both the sine and cosine are present.\u00a0 Also, we have not yet justified the guess for the case where both a sine and a cosine show up.\u00a0 We will justify this later....\u00a0...We now need move on to some more complicated functions.\u00a0 The more complicated functions arise by taking products and sums of the basic kinds of functions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first look at products....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Find   a particular solution for the following differential equation....You\u2019re probably getting tired of the opening comment, but   again find the complementary solution first really a good idea but again   we\u2019ve already done the work in the first example so we won\u2019t do it again   here.\u00a0 We promise that eventually   you\u2019ll see why we keep using the same homogeneous problem and why we say it\u2019s   a good idea to have the complementary solution in hand first.\u00a0 At this point all we\u2019re trying to do is   reinforce the habit of finding the complementary solution first....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s start off by writing down the guesses for the   individual pieces of the function.\u00a0 The   guess for the ... would be...while the guess for the exponential would be...\u00a0...Now, since we\u2019ve got a product of two functions it seems   like taking a product of the guesses for the individual pieces might   work.\u00a0 Doing this would give...\u00a0...However, we will have problems with this.\u00a0 As we will see, when we plug our guess into   the differential equation we will only get two equations out of this.\u00a0 The problem is that with this guess we\u2019ve   got three unknown constants.\u00a0 With only   two equations we won\u2019t be able to solve for all the constants....\u00a0...This is easy to fix however.\u00a0 Let\u2019s notice that we could do the following...\u00a0...If we multiply the ...   through, we can see that the guess can be written in such a way that there   are really only two constants.\u00a0 So, we   will use the following for our guess....\u00a0...Notice that this is nothing more than the guess for the ... with an exponential tacked on for   good measure....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve got our guess, let\u2019s differentiate, plug   into the differential equation and collect like terms....\u00a0...Note that when we\u2019re collecting like terms we want the   coefficient of each term to have only constants in it.\u00a0 Following this rule we will get two terms   when we collect like terms.\u00a0 Now, set   coefficients equal....A particular solution for this differential equation is   then...\u00a0...This last example illustrated the general rule that we will follow when products involve an exponential.\u00a0 When a product involves an exponential we will first strip out the exponential and write down the guess for the portion of the function without the exponential, then we will go back and tack on the exponential without any leading coefficient....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some more products.\u00a0 In the interest of brevity we will just write down the guess for a particular solution and not go through all the details of finding the constants.\u00a0 Also, because we aren\u2019t going to give an actual differential equation we can\u2019t deal with finding the complementary solution first....\u00a0...Write   down the form of the particular solution to...for the following ...\u2019s....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we have an exponential in the function.\u00a0 Remember the rule.\u00a0 We will ignore the exponential and write   down a guess for 16 sin(10...) then   put the exponential back in....\u00a0...The guess for the sine is...\u00a0...Now, for the actual guess for the particular solution   we\u2019ll take the above guess and tack an exponential onto it.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...One final note before we move onto the next part.\u00a0 The 16 in front of the function has   absolutely no bearing on our guess.\u00a0   Any constants multiplying the whole function are ignored....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...We will start this one the same way that we initially   started the previous example.\u00a0 The   guess for the polynomial is...and the guess for the cosine is...\u00a0...If we multiply the two guesses we get....\u00a0...Let\u2019s simplify things up a little.\u00a0 First multiply the polynomial through as   follows....\u00a0...Notice that everywhere one of the unknown constants occurs   it is in a product of unknown constants.\u00a0   This means that if we went through and used this as our guess the   system of equations that we would need to solve for the unknown constants   would have products of the unknowns in them.\u00a0   These types of systems are generally very difficult to solve.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, to avoid this we will do the same thing that we did in   the previous example.\u00a0 Everywhere we   see a product of constants we will rename it and call it a single   constant.\u00a0 The guess that we\u2019ll use for   this function will be....\u00a0...This is a general rule that we will use when faced with a   product of a polynomial and a trig function.\u00a0   We write down the guess for the polynomial and then multiply that by a   cosine.\u00a0 We then write down the guess   for the polynomial again, using different coefficients, and multiply this by   a sine....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This final part has all three parts to it.\u00a0 First we will ignore the exponential and   write down a guess for....\u00a0...The minus sign can also be ignored.\u00a0 The guess for this is...\u00a0...Now, tack an exponential back on and we\u2019re done....\u00a0...Notice that we put the exponential on both terms....\u00a0...There a couple of general rules that you need to remember for products....\u00a0...\u00a0...If you can remember these two rules you can\u2019t go wrong with products.\u00a0 Writing down the guesses for products is usually not that difficult.\u00a0 The difficulty arises when you need to actually find the constants....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at sums of the basic components and/or products of the basic components.\u00a0 To do this we\u2019ll need the following fact....\u00a0...If ...   is a particular solution for...and if ...   is a particular solution for...then ... is a particular solution for...\u00a0...This fact can be used to both find particular solutions to differential equations that have sums in then and to write down guess for functions that have sums in them....\u00a0...Find   a particular solution for the following differential equation....This example is the reason that we\u2019ve been using the same homogeneous   differential equation for all the previous examples.\u00a0 There is nothing to do with this   problem.\u00a0 All that we need to do it go   back to the appropriate examples above and get the particular solution from   that example and add them all together.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Doing this gives...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of other examples.\u00a0 As with the products we\u2019ll just get guesses here and not worry about actually finding the coefficients....\u00a0...Write   down the form of the particular solution to...for the following ...\u2019s....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This first one we\u2019ve actually already told you how to   do.\u00a0 This is in the table of the basic   functions.\u00a0 However we wanted to   justify the guess that we put down there.\u00a0   Using the fact on sums of function we would be tempted to write down a   guess for the cosine and a guess for the sine. This would give....\u00a0...So, we would get a cosine from each guess and a sine from   each guess.\u00a0 The problem with this as a   guess is that we are only going to get two equations to solve after plugging   into the differential equation and yet we have 4 unknowns.\u00a0 We will never be able to solve for each of   the constants. ...\u00a0...To fix this notice that we can combine some terms as   follows....\u00a0...Upon doing this we can see that we\u2019ve really got a single   cosine with a coefficient and a single sine with a coefficient and so we may   as well just use...\u00a0...The general rule of thumb for writing down guesses for   functions that involve sums is to always combine like terms into single terms   with single coefficients.\u00a0 This will   greatly simplify the work required to find the coefficients....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...For this one we will get two sets of sines and   cosines.\u00a0 This will arise because we   have two different arguments in them.\u00a0   We will get on set for the sine with just a ... as its argument and we\u2019ll get another set for the sine and   cosine with the 14... as their   arguments....\u00a0...The guess for this function is...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The main point of this problem is dealing with the   constant.\u00a0 But that isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 We just wanted to make sure that an example   of that is somewhere in the notes.\u00a0 If   you recall that a constant is nothing more than a zeroth degree polynomial   the guess becomes clear....\u00a0...The guess for this function is...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This one can be a little tricky if you aren\u2019t paying   attention.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first rewrite the   function...\u00a0...All we did was move the 9.\u00a0   However upon doing that we see that the function is really a sum of a   quadratic polynomial and a sine.\u00a0 The   guess for this is then...\u00a0...If we don\u2019t do this and treat the function as the sum of   three terms we would get...and as with the first part in this example we would end up   with two terms that are essentially the same (the ... and the ...) and so   would need to be combined.\u00a0 An added   step that isn\u2019t really necessary if we first rewrite the function....\u00a0...Look for problems where rearranging the function can   simplify the initial guess....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...\u00a0So, this look like   we\u2019ve got a sum of three terms here.\u00a0   Let\u2019s write down a guess for that....\u00a0...Notice however that if we were to multiply the exponential   in the second term through we would end up with two terms that are   essentially the same and would need to be combined.\u00a0 This is a case where the guess for one term   is completely contained in the guess for a different term.\u00a0 When this happens we just drop the guess   that\u2019s already included in the other term....\u00a0...So, the guess here is actually....\u00a0...Notice that this arose because we had two terms in our ... whose only difference was the   polynomial that sat in front of them.\u00a0   When this happens we look at the term that contains the largest degree   polynomial, write down the guess for that and don\u2019t bother writing down the guess   for the other term as that guess will be completely contained in the first   guess....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ve got two terms whose guess without the   polynomials in front of them would be the same.\u00a0 Therefore, we will take the one with the   largest degree polynomial in front of it and write down the guess for that   one and ignore the other term.\u00a0 So, the   guess for the function is...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This last part is designed to make sure you understand the   general rule that we used in the last two parts.\u00a0 This time there really are three terms and   we will need a guess for each term.\u00a0   The guess here is...\u00a0...We can only combine guesses if they are identical up to   the constant.\u00a0 So we can\u2019t combine the   first exponential with the second because the second is really multiplied by   a cosine and a sine and so the two exponentials are in fact different   functions.\u00a0 Likewise, the last sine and   cosine can\u2019t be combined with those in the middle term because the sine and   cosine in the middle term are in fact multiplied by an exponential and so are   different....\u00a0...So, when dealing with sums of functions make sure that you look for identical guesses that may or may not be contained in other guesses and combine them.\u00a0 This will simplify your work later on....\u00a0...We have one last topic in this section that needs to be dealt with.\u00a0 In the first few examples we were constantly harping on the usefulness of having the complementary solution in hand before making the guess for a particular solution.\u00a0 We never gave any reason for this other that \u201ctrust us\u201d.\u00a0 It is now time to see why having the complementary solution in hand first is useful.\u00a0 This is best shown with an example so let\u2019s jump into one....\u00a0...Find   a particular solution for the following differential equation....This problem seems almost too simple to be given this late   in the section.\u00a0 This is especially   true given the ease of finding a particular solution for ...(...)\u2019s that are just   exponential functions.\u00a0 Also, because   the point of this example is to illustrate why it is generally a good idea to   have the complementary solution in hand first we\u2019ll let\u2019s go ahead and recall   the complementary solution first.\u00a0 Here   it is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, without worrying about the complementary solution for   a couple more seconds let\u2019s go ahead and get to work on the particular   solution.\u00a0 There is not much to the   guess here.\u00a0 From our previous work we   know that the guess for the particular solution should be,...\u00a0...Plugging this into the differential equation gives,...Hmmmm\u2026.\u00a0 Something   seems wrong here.\u00a0 Clearly an   exponential can\u2019t be zero.\u00a0 So, what   went wrong?\u00a0 We finally need the   complementary solution. Notice that the second term in the complementary   solution (listed above) is exactly our guess for the form of the particular   solution and now recall that both portions of the complementary solution are   solutions to the homogeneous differential equation,...\u00a0...In other words, we had better have gotten zero by plugging   our guess into the differential equation, it is a solution to the homogeneous   differential equation!...\u00a0...So, how do we fix this?\u00a0   The way that we fix this is to add a ... to our guess as follows....\u00a0...Plugging this into our differential equation gives,...\u00a0...Now, we can set coefficients equal....So, the particular solution in this case is,...\u00a0...So, what did we learn from this last example.\u00a0 While technically we don\u2019t need the complementary solution to do undetermined coefficients, you can go through a lot of work only to figure out at the end that you needed to add in a ... to the guess because it appeared in the complementary solution.\u00a0 This work is avoidable if we first find the complementary solution and comparing our guess to the complementary solution and seeing if any portion of your guess shows up in the complementary solution.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If a portion of your guess does show up in the complementary solution then we\u2019ll need to modify that portion of the guess by adding in a ...\u00a0 to the portion of the guess that is causing the problems.\u00a0 We do need to be a little careful and make sure that we add the ... in the correct place however.\u00a0 The following set of examples will show you how to do this....\u00a0...Write   down the guess for the particular solution to the given differential   equation.\u00a0 Do not find the   coefficients....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...In these solutions we\u2019ll leave the details of checking the   complementary solution to you....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...The complementary solution is...\u00a0...Remembering to put the \u201c-1\u201d with the 7... gives a first guess for the particular solution....\u00a0...Notice that the last term in the guess is the last term in   the complementary solution.\u00a0 The first   two terms however aren\u2019t a problem and don\u2019t appear in the complementary   solution.\u00a0 Therefore, we will only add   a ... onto the last term. ...\u00a0...The correct guess for the form of the particular solution   is....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...The complementary solution is...\u00a0...A first guess for the particular solution is...\u00a0...Notice that if we multiplied the exponential term through   the parenthesis that we would end up getting part of the complementary   solution showing up.\u00a0 Since the problem   part arises from the first term the ...   first term will get multiplied by ....\u00a0 The second and third terms are okay as they   are....\u00a0...The correct guess for the form of the particular solution   in this case is....\u00a0...So, in general, if you were to multiply out a guess and if any term in the result shows up in the complementary solution, then the whole   term will get a ... not just the   problem portion of the term....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...The complementary solution is...\u00a0...A first guess for the particular solution is...\u00a0...In this case both the second and third terms contain   portions of the complementary solution.\u00a0   The first term doesn\u2019t however, since upon multiplying out, both the   sine and the cosine would have an exponential with them and that isn\u2019t part   of the complementary solution.\u00a0 We only   need to worry about terms showing up in the complementary solution if the   only difference between the complementary solution term and the particular   guess term is the constant in front of them....\u00a0...So, in this case the second and third terms will get a ... while the first won\u2019t...\u00a0...The correct guess for the form of the particular solution   is....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...To get this problem we changed the differential equation   from the last example and left the ...   alone.\u00a0 The complementary solution this   time is...\u00a0...As with the last part, a first guess for the particular   solution is...\u00a0...This time however it is the first term that causes   problems and not the second or third.\u00a0   In fact, the first term is exactly the complementary solution and so   it will need a ....\u00a0 Recall that we will only have a problem   with a term in our guess if it only differs from the complementary solution   by a constant.\u00a0 The second and third   terms in our guess don\u2019t have the exponential in them and so they don\u2019t   differ from the complementary solution by only a constant....\u00a0...The correct guess for the form of the particular solution   is....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...The complementary solution is...The two terms in ...   are identical with the exception of a polynomial in front of them.\u00a0 So this means that we only need to look at   the term with the highest degree polynomial in front of it.\u00a0 A first guess for the particular solution   is...\u00a0...Notice that if we multiplied the exponential term through   the parenthesis the last two terms would be the complementary solution.\u00a0 Therefore, we will need to multiply this   whole thing by a .......\u00a0...The next guess for the particular solution is then....\u00a0...This still causes problems however.\u00a0 If we multiplied the ... and the exponential through, the last term will still be in the   complementary solution.\u00a0 In this case,   unlike the previous ones, a ...   wasn\u2019t sufficient to fix the problem.\u00a0   So, we will add in another ...   to our guess....\u00a0...The correct guess for the form of the particular solution   is....\u00a0...Upon multiplying this out none of the terms are in the   complementary solution and so it will be okay....\u00a0...As this last set of examples has shown, we really should have the complementary solution in hand before even writing down the first guess for the particular solution.\u00a0 By doing this we can compare our guess to the complementary solution and if any of the terms from your particular solution show up we will know that we\u2019ll have problems.\u00a0 Once the problem is identified we can add a ... to the problem term(s) and compare our new guess to the complementary solution.\u00a0 If there are no problems we can proceed with the problem, if there are problems add in another ... and compare again....\u00a0...Can you see a general rule as to when a ... will be needed and when a ... will be needed for second order differential equations?", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/UndeterminedCoefficients.aspx", "media": "text", "title":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the previous section we modeled a population based on the assumption that the growth rate would be a constant.\u00a0 However, in reality this doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u00a0 Clearly a population cannot be allowed to grow forever at the same rate.\u00a0 The growth rate of a population needs to depend on the population itself.\u00a0 Once a population reaches a certain point the growth rate will start reduce, often drastically.\u00a0 A much more realistic model of a population growth is given by the ....\u00a0 Here is the logistic growth equation....\u00a0...In the logistic growth equation ... is the ... and is the same ... as in the last section.\u00a0 In other words, it is the growth rate that will occur in the absence of any limiting factors.\u00a0 ... is called either the ... or the .......\u00a0...Now, we claimed that this was a more realistic model for a population.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if that in fact is correct.\u00a0 To allow us to sketch a direction field let\u2019s pick a couple of numbers for ... and ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll use ...\u00a0and ... = 10.\u00a0 For these values the logistics equation is....\u00a0...If you need a refresher on sketching direction fields go back and take a look at that ....\u00a0 First notice that the derivative will be zero at ... = 0 and ... = 10.\u00a0 Also notice that these are in fact solutions to the differential equation.\u00a0 These two values are called ... since they are constant solutions to the differential equation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave the rest of the details on sketching the direction field to you.\u00a0 Here is the direction field as well as a couple of solutions sketched in as well....\u00a0...Note, that we included a small portion of negative ...\u2019s in here even though they really don\u2019t make any sense for a population problem.\u00a0 The reason for this will be apparent down the road.\u00a0 Also, notice that a population of say 8 doesn\u2019t make all that much sense so let\u2019s assume that population is in thousands or millions so that 8 actually represents 8,000 or 8,000,000 individuals in a population....\u00a0...Notice that if we start with a population of zero, there is no growth and the population stays at zero.\u00a0 So, the logistic equation will correctly figure out that.\u00a0 Next, notice that if we start with a population in the range 0 < ...(0) < 10 then the population will grow, but start to level off once we get close to a population of 10.\u00a0 If we start with a population of 10, the population will stay at 10.\u00a0 Finally if we start with a population that is greater than 10, then the population will actually die off until we start nearing a population of 10, at which point the population decline will start to slow down....\u00a0...Now, from a realistic standpoint this should make some sense.\u00a0 Populations can\u2019t just grow forever without bound.\u00a0 Eventually the population will reach such a size that the resources of an area are no longer able to sustain the population and the population growth will start to slow as it comes closer to this threshold.\u00a0 Also, if you start off with a population greater than what an area can sustain there will actually be a die off until we get near to this threshold....\u00a0...In this case that threshold appears to be 10, which is also the value of ... for our problem.\u00a0 That should explain the name that we gave ... initially.\u00a0 The carrying capacity or saturation level of an area is the maximum sustainable population for that area....\u00a0...So, the logistics equation, while still quite simplistic, does a much better job of modeling what will happen to a population....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s move on to the point of this section.\u00a0 The logistics equation is an example of an ....\u00a0 Autonomous differential equations are differential equations that are of the form....The only place that the independent variable, ... in this case, appears is in the derivative.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that if ...for some value ...\u00a0then this will also be a solution to the differential equation.\u00a0 These values are called ...or ....\u00a0 What we would like to do is classify these solutions.\u00a0 By classify we mean the following.\u00a0 If solutions start \u201cnear\u201d an equilibrium solution will they move away from the equilibrium solution or towards the equilibrium solution?\u00a0 Upon classifying the equilibrium solutions we can then know what all the other solutions to the differential equation will do in the long term simply by looking at which equilibrium solutions they start near....\u00a0...So, just what do I mean by \u201cnear\u201d?\u00a0 Go back to our logistics equation....\u00a0...As we pointed out there are two equilibrium solutions to this equation ... = 0 and ... = 10.\u00a0 If we ignore the fact that we\u2019re dealing with population these points break up the ... number line into three distinct regions....\u00a0...We will say that a solution starts \u201cnear\u201d an equilibrium solution if it starts in a region that is on either side of that equilibrium solution.\u00a0 So solutions that start \u201cnear\u201d the equilibrium solution ... = 10 will start in either...and solutions that start \u201cnear\u201d ... = 0 will start in either...\u00a0...For regions that lie between two equilibrium solutions we can think of any solutions starting in that region as starting \u201cnear\u201d either of the two equilibrium solutions as we need to....\u00a0...Now, solutions that start \u201cnear\u201d ... = 0 all move away from the solution as ... increases.\u00a0 Note that moving away does not necessarily mean that they grow without bound as they move away.\u00a0 It only means that they move away.\u00a0 Solutions that start out greater than ... = 0 move away, but do stay bounded as ... grows.\u00a0 In fact, they move in towards ... = 10....\u00a0...Equilibrium solutions in which solutions that start \u201cnear\u201d them move away from the equilibrium solution are called ... or ....\u00a0 So, for our logistics equation, ... = 0 is an unstable equilibrium solution....\u00a0...Next, solutions that start \u201cnear\u201d ... = 10 all move in toward ... = 10 as ... increases.\u00a0 Equilibrium solutions in which solutions that start \u201cnear\u201d them move toward the equilibrium solution are called ... or ....\u00a0 So, ... = 10 is an asymptotically stable equilibrium solution....\u00a0...There is one more classification, but I\u2019ll wait until we get an example in which this occurs to introduce it.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Find   and classify all the equilibrium solutions to the following differential   equation....First, find the equilibrium solutions.\u00a0 This is generally easy enough to

All we need to do is plug ... in the equation for the tangent line....\u00a0...Now, we would like to proceed in a similar manner, but we don\u2019t have the value of the solution at ... and so we won\u2019t know the slope of the tangent line to the solution at this point.\u00a0 This is a problem.\u00a0 We can partially solve it however, by recalling that ... is an approximation to the solution at ....\u00a0 If ... is a very good approximation to the actual value of the solution then we can use that to estimate the slope of the tangent line at ...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s hope that ... is a good approximation to the solution and construct a line through the point (..., ...) that has slope ... (..., ...).\u00a0 This gives...\u00a0...Now, to get an approximation to the solution at ... ... we will hope that this new line will be fairly close to the actual solution at ... and use the value of the line at ... as an approximation to the actual solution.\u00a0 This gives....\u00a0...We can continue in this fashion.\u00a0 Use the previously computed approximation to get the next approximation.\u00a0 So,...\u00a0...In general, if we have ... and the approximation to the solution at this point, ..., and we want to find the approximation at ... all we need to do is use the following....\u00a0...If we define ...\u00a0we can simplify the formula to...\u00a0...Often, we will assume that the step sizes between the points ... , ... , ... , \u2026 are of a uniform size of ....\u00a0 In other words, we will often assume that ...\u00a0...This doesn\u2019t have to be done and there are times when it\u2019s best that we not do this.\u00a0 However, if we do the formula for the next approximation becomes.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, how do we use Euler\u2019s Method?\u00a0 It\u2019s fairly simple.\u00a0 We start with ... and then decide if we want to use a uniform step size or not.\u00a0 Then starting with (..., ...) we repeatedly evaluate ... or ... depending on whether we chose to use a uniform set size or not.\u00a0 We continue until we\u2019ve gone the desired number of steps or reached the desired time.\u00a0 This will give us a sequence of numbers ... , ... , ... , \u2026 ...\u00a0 that will approximate the value of the actual solution at ... , ... , ... , \u2026 ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...What do we do if we want a value of the solution at some other point than those used here?\u00a0 One possibility is to go back and redefine our set of points to a new set that will include the points we are after and redo Euler\u2019s Method using this new set of points.\u00a0 However this is cumbersome and could take a lot of time especially if we had to make changes to the set of points more than once....\u00a0...Another possibility is to remember how we arrived at the approximations in the first place.\u00a0 Recall that we used the tangent line...to get the value of ....\u00a0 We could use this tangent line as an approximation for the solution on the interval [..., ...].\u00a0 Likewise, we used the tangent line...to get the value of ....\u00a0 We could use this tangent line as an approximation for the solution on the interval [..., ...].\u00a0 Continuing in this manner we would get a set of lines that, when strung together, should be an approximation to the solution as a whole.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In practice you would need to write a computer program to do these computations for you.\u00a0 In most cases the function ... would be too large and/or complicated to use by hand and in most serious uses of Euler\u2019s Method you would want to use hundreds of steps which would make doing this by hand prohibitive.\u00a0 So, here is a bit of ... that you can use to write a program for Euler\u2019s Method that uses a uniform step size, .......\u00a0...\u00a0...The ... for a non-uniform step size would be a little more complicated, but it would essentially be the same....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples.\u00a0 We\u2019ll use Euler\u2019s Method to approximate solutions to a couple of first order differential equations.\u00a0 The differential equations that we\u2019ll be using are linear first order differential equations that can be easily solved for an exact solution.\u00a0 Of course, in practice we wouldn\u2019t use Euler\u2019s Method on these kinds of differential equations, but by using easily solvable differential equations we will be able to check the accuracy of the method.\u00a0 Knowing the accuracy of any approximation method is a good thing.\u00a0 It is important to know if the method is liable to give a good approximation or not....\u00a0...For   the IVP...Use Euler\u2019s Method with a step size of ... = 0.1 to find approximate values of   the solution at ... = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,   0.4, and 0.5.\u00a0 Compare them to the   exact values of the solution as these points....\u00a0...This is a fairly simple linear differential equation so   we\u2019ll leave it to you to check that the solution is...\u00a0...In order to use Euler\u2019s Method we first need to rewrite   the differential equation into the form given in .......\u00a0...From this we can see that ....\u00a0 Also note that ... = 0 and ...   = 1.\u00a0 We can now start doing some   computations....\u00a0...So, the approximation to the solution at ... = 0.1 is ... = 0.9....\u00a0...At the next step we have...\u00a0...Therefore, the approximation to the solution at ... = 0.2 is ... = 0.852967995....\u00a0...I\u2019ll leave it to you to check the remainder of these computations....\u00a0...Here\u2019s a quick table that gives the approximations as well   as the exact value of the solutions at the given points.\u00a0 ...\u00a0... = 0... =1 ... = 1...0 %... = 0.1... =0.9... = 0.925794646...2.79 %... = 0.2... =0.852967995... = 0.889504459...4.11 %... = 0.3... =0.837441500...

It\u2019s often easier to see how well an   approximation does if you look at percentages.\u00a0 The formula for this is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We used absolute value in the numerator because we really   don\u2019t care at this point if the approximation is larger or smaller than the   exact.\u00a0 We\u2019re only interested in how   close the two are....\u00a0...The maximum error in the approximations from the last example was 4.42%, which isn\u2019t too bad, but also isn\u2019t all that great of an approximation.\u00a0 So, provided we aren\u2019t after very accurate approximations this didn\u2019t do too badly.\u00a0 This kind of error is generally unacceptable in almost all real applications however.\u00a0 So, how can we get better approximations?...\u00a0...Recall that we are getting the approximations by using a tangent line to approximate the value of the solution and that we are moving forward in time by steps of ....\u00a0\u00a0 So, if we want a more accurate approximation, then it seems like one way to get a better approximation is to not move forward as much with each step.\u00a0 In other words, take smaller ...\u2019s.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Repeat   the previous example only this time give the approximations at ...\u00a0= 1, ...\u00a0= 2, ...\u00a0= 3, ...\u00a0= 4, and ...\u00a0= 5.\u00a0 Use ...   = 0.1, ... = 0.05, ... = 0.01, ... = 0.005, and ... =   0.001 for the approximations....\u00a0...Below are two tables, one gives approximations to the   solution and the other gives the errors for each approximation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave the computational details to   you to check....\u00a0... = 1...0.9414902...0.9313244...0.9364698...0.9404994...0.9409957...0.9413914... =

as we expected.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are a couple of other interesting things to note from the data.\u00a0 First, notice that in general, decreasing the step size, ..., by a factor of 10 also decreased the error by about a factor of 10 as well.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, notice that as ... increases the approximation actually tends to get better.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t the case completely as we can see that in all but the first case the ... = 3 error is worse than the error at ... = 2, but after that point, it only gets better.\u00a0 This should not be expected in general.\u00a0 In this case this is more a function of the shape of the solution.\u00a0 Below is a graph of the solution (the line) as well as the approximations (the dots) for ... = 0.1....\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that the approximation is worst where the function is changing rapidly.\u00a0 This should not be too surprising.\u00a0 Recall that we\u2019re using tangent lines to get the approximations and so the value of the tangent line at a given ... will often be significantly different than the function due to the rapidly changing function at that point. ...\u00a0...Also, in this case, because the function ends up fairly flat as ... increases, the tangents start looking like the function itself and so the approximations are very accurate.\u00a0 This won\u2019t always be the case of course....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at one more example....\u00a0...For   the IVP...Use Euler\u2019s Method to find the approximation to the   solution at ...\u00a0= 1, ...\u00a0= 2, ...\u00a0= 3, ...\u00a0= 4, and ...\u00a0= 5.\u00a0 Use ...   = 0.1, ... = 0.05, ... = 0.01, ... = 0.005, and ... =   0.001 for the approximations....\u00a0...I\u2019ll leave it to you to check the details of the solution   process.\u00a0 The solution to this linear   first order differential equation is....\u00a0...Here are two tables giving the approximations and the   percentage error for each approximation....\u00a0... = 1...-1.58100...-0.97167...-1.26512...-1.51580...-1.54826...-1.57443... = 2...-1.47880...0.65270...-0.34327...-2.18657...-1.35810...-1.45453... =

example Euler\u2019s Method does not do nearly as   well as it did on the first IVP.\u00a0 Some   of the observations we made in Example 2 are still true however.\u00a0 Decreasing the size of ... decreases the error as we saw with the last example and would   expect to happen.\u00a0 Also, as we saw in   the last example, decreasing ... by a   factor of 10 also decreases the error by about a factor of 10....\u00a0...However, unlike the last example increasing ... sees an increasing error.\u00a0 This behavior is fairly common in the   approximations.\u00a0 We shouldn\u2019t expect   the error to decrease as ...   increases as we saw in the last example.\u00a0   Each successive approximation is found using a previous   approximation.\u00a0 Therefore, at each step   we introduce error and so approximations should, in general, get worse as ... increases....\u00a0...Below is a graph of the solution (the line) as well as the   approximations (the dots) for ... =   0.05....\u00a0...\u00a0...As we can see the approximations do follow the general   shape of the solution, however, the error is clearly getting much worse as ... increases....\u00a0...So, Euler\u2019s method is a nice method for approximating fairly nice solutions that don\u2019t change rapidly.\u00a0 However, not all solutions will be this nicely behaved.\u00a0 There are other approximation methods that do a much better job of approximating solutions.\u00a0 These are not the focus of this course however, so I\u2019ll leave it to you to look further into this field if you are interested....\u00a0...Also notice that we don\u2019t generally have the actual solution around to check the accuracy of the approximation.\u00a0 We generally try to find bounds on the error for each method that will tell us how well an approximation should do.\u00a0 These error bounds are again not really the focus of this course, so I\u2019ll leave these to you as well if you\u2019re interested

is, it is of exponential   order.\u00a0 This means that ...\u00a0...The first term does go to zero in the limit.\u00a0 The second term however, will only go to   zero if ... = 0.\u00a0 Therefore, we must have ... = 0 in order for this to be the   transform of our solution....\u00a0...So, the transform of our solution, as well as the solution   is,...\u00a0...\u00a0I\u2019ll leave it to   you to verify that this is in fact a solution if you\u2019d like to....\u00a0...Now, not all nonconstant differential equations need to use ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at one more example....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....From the first example we have,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll also need,...\u00a0...Taking the ...   transform of everything and plugging in the initial conditions gives,...\u00a0...Once again we have a linear first order differential   equation that we must solve in order to get a transform for the   solution.\u00a0 Notice as well that we never   used the second initial condition in this work.\u00a0 That is okay, we will use it eventually....\u00a0...Since this linear differential equation is much easier to   solve compared to the first one, we\u2019ll leave the details to you.\u00a0 Upon solving the differential equation we   get,...\u00a0...Now, this transform goes to zero for all values of ... and we can take the inverse   transform of the second term.\u00a0   Therefore, we won\u2019t need to use ...   to get rid of the second term as did in the previous example....\u00a0...Taking the inverse transform gives,...\u00a0...Now, is where we will use the second initial condition.\u00a0 Upon differentiating and plugging in the   second initial condition we can see that ...-4....\u00a0...So, the solution to this IVP is,...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve seen how to use ... transforms to solve some nonconstant coefficient differential equations.\u00a0 Notice however that all we did was add in an occasional ... to the coefficients.\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t get too complicated with the coefficients.\u00a0 If we had we would not have been able to easily use ... transforms to solve them....\u00a0...Sometimes ... transforms can be used to solve nonconstant differential equations, however, in general, nonconstant differential equations are still very difficult to solve.", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We now need to go back and revisit the substitution rule as it applies to definite integrals.\u00a0 At some level there really isn\u2019t a lot to do in this section.\u00a0 Recall that the first step in doing a definite integral is to compute the indefinite integral and that hasn\u2019t changed.\u00a0 We will still compute the indefinite integral first.\u00a0 This means that we already know how to do these.\u00a0 We use the substitution rule to find the indefinite integral and then do the evaluation....\u00a0...There are however, two ways to deal with the evaluation step.\u00a0 One of the ways of doing the evaluation is the probably the most obvious at this point, but also has a point in the process where we can get in trouble if we aren\u2019t paying attention....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work an example illustrating both ways of doing the evaluation step....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following definite integral....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off looking at the first way of dealing with   the evaluation step.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to be   careful with this method as there is a point in the process where if we   aren\u2019t paying attention we\u2019ll get the wrong answer....\u00a0...We\u2019ll first need to compute the indefinite integral using   the substitution rule.\u00a0 Note however,   that we will constantly remind ourselves that this is a definite integral by   putting the limits on the integral at each step.\u00a0 Without the limits it\u2019s easy to forget that   we had a definite integral when we\u2019ve gotten the indefinite integral   computed....\u00a0...In this case the substitution is,...\u00a0...Plugging this into the integral gives,...Notice that we didn\u2019t do the evaluation yet.\u00a0 This is where the potential problem arises   with this solution method.\u00a0 The limits   given here are from the original integral and hence are values of ....\u00a0   We have ...\u2019s in our   solution.\u00a0 We can\u2019t plug values of ... in for .......\u00a0...Therefore, we will have to go back to ...\u2019s before we do the substitution.\u00a0 This is the standard step in the   substitution process, but it is often forgotten when doing definite   integrals.\u00a0 Note as well that in this   case, if we don\u2019t go back to ...\u2019s we   will have a small problem in that one of the evaluations will end up giving   us a complex number....\u00a0...So, finishing this problem gives,...\u00a0...So, that was the first solution method.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at the second method....\u00a0...Note that this solution method isn\u2019t really all that   different from the first method.\u00a0 In   this method we are going to remember that when doing a substitution we want   to eliminate all the ...\u2019s in the   integral and write everything in terms of ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...When we say all here we really mean all.\u00a0 In other words, remember that the limits on   the integral are also values of ...   and we\u2019re going to convert the limits into ... values.\u00a0 Converting the   limits is pretty simple since our substitution will tell us how to relate ... and ... so all we need to do is plug in the original ... limits into the substitution and   we\u2019ll get the new ... limits....\u00a0...Here is the substitution (it\u2019s the same as the first   method) as well as the limit conversions....\u00a0...The integral is now,...\u00a0...As with the first method let\u2019s pause here a moment to   remind us what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 In this   case, we\u2019ve converted the limits to ...\u2019s   and we\u2019ve also got our integral in terms of ...\u2019s and so here we can just plug the limits directly into our   integral.\u00a0 Note that in this case we   won\u2019t plug our substitution back in.\u00a0   Doing this here would cause problems as we would have ...\u2019s in the integral and our limits   would be ...\u2019s.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the rest of this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...We got exactly the same answer and this time didn\u2019t have   to worry about going back to ...\u2019s in   our answer....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve seen two solution techniques for computing definite integrals that require the substitution rule.\u00a0 Both are valid solution methods and each have their uses.\u00a0 We will be using the second exclusively however since it makes the evaluation step a little easier....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Since we\u2019ve done quite a few substitution rule integrals   to this time we aren\u2019t going to put a lot of effort into explaining the   substitution part of things here....\u00a0... ...The substitution and converted limits are,...\u00a0...Sometimes a limit will remain the same after the   substitution.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get excited when   it happens and don\u2019t expect it to happen all the time....\u00a0...Here is the integral,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t get excited about large numbers for answers   here.\u00a0 Sometime they are. \u00a0That\u2019s life....\u00a0... ...Here is the substitution and converted limits for this   problem,...\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0... ...This integral needs to be split into two integrals since   the first term doesn\u2019t require a substitution and the second does....\u00a0...Here is the substitution and converted limits for the   second term....\u00a0...Here is the integral.... ...This integral will require two substitutions.\u00a0 So first split up the integral so we can do   a substitution on each term....\u00a0...There are the two substitutions for these integrals....\u00a0...Here is the integral for this problem....\u00a0...The next set of examples is designed to make sure that we don\u2019t forget about a very important point about definite integrals....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...Be careful with this integral.\u00a0 The denominator is zero at ...\u00a0and both of these are in the interval of   integration.\u00a0 Therefore, this integrand   is not continuous in the interval and so the integral can\u2019t be done. ...\u00a0...Be careful with definite integrals and be on the lookout   for division by zero problems.\u00a0 In the   previous section they were easy to spot since all the division by zero   problems that we had there were at zero.\u00a0   Once we move into substitution problems however they will not always   be so easy to spot so make sure that you first take a quick look at the   integrand and see if there are any continuity problems with the integrand and   if they occur in the interval of integration....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...Now, in this case the integral can be done because the two   points of discontinuity, ...,   are both outside of the interval of integration.\u00a0 The substitution and converted limits in   this case are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...   ...\u00a0...The integral is

...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another set of examples.\u00a0 These are a little tougher (at least in appearance) than the previous sets....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...The limits are a little unusual in this case, but that   will happen sometimes so don\u2019t get too excited about it.\u00a0 Here is the substitution. ...\u00a0...The integral is then,... ...Here is the substitution and converted limits for this   problem....The integral is,... ...Here is the substitution and converted limits and don\u2019t   get too excited about the substitution.\u00a0   It\u2019s a little messy in the case, but that can happen on occasion....\u00a0...Here is the integral,...\u00a0...So, not only was the substitution messy, but we also a   messy answer, but again that\u2019s life on occasion....\u00a0... ...This problem not as bad as it looks.\u00a0 Here is the substitution and converted   limits....\u00a0...The cosine in the very front of the integrand will get   substituted away in the differential and so this integrand actually   simplifies down significantly.\u00a0 Here is   the integral....Don\u2019t get excited about these kinds of answers.\u00a0 On occasion we will end up with trig   function evaluations like this....\u00a0... ...This is also a tricky substitution (at least until you see   it).\u00a0 Here it is,...\u00a0...Here is the integral....\u00a0...In this last set of examples we saw some tricky substitutions and messy limits, but these are a fact of life with some substitution problems and so we need to be prepared for dealing with them when they happen....\u00a0...This is the last topic that we need to discuss in this chapter.\u00a0 It is probably better suited in the previous section, but that section has already gotten fairly large so I decided to put it here....\u00a0...First, recall that an even function is any function which satisfies,...Typical examples of even functions are,...\u00a0...An odd function is any function which satisfies,...The typical examples of odd functions are,...\u00a0...There are a couple of nice facts about integrating even and odd functions over the interval [...].\u00a0 If ... is an even function then,...Likewise, if ... is an odd function then,...\u00a0...Note that in order to use these facts the limit of integration must be the same number, but opposite signs!...\u00a0...Integrate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Neither of these are terribly difficult integrals, but we   can use the facts on them anyway....\u00a0... ...In this case the integrand is even and the interval is   correct so,...So, using the fact cut the evaluation in half (in essence   since one of the new limits was zero)....\u00a0... ...The integrand in this case is odd and the interval is in   the correct form and so we don\u2019t even need to integrate.\u00a0 Just use the fact....\u00a0...Note that the limits of integration are important here.\u00a0 Take the last integral as an example.\u00a0 A small change to the limits will not give us zero....\u00a0...\u00a0...The moral here is to be careful and not misuse these facts.", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "As noted in the first section of this section there are two kinds of integrals and to this point we\u2019ve looked at indefinite integrals.\u00a0 It is now time to start thinking about the second kind of integral : Definite Integrals.\u00a0 However, before we do that we\u2019re going to take a look at the Area Problem.\u00a0 The area problem is to definite integrals what the tangent and rate of change problems are to derivatives....\u00a0...The area problem will give us one of the interpretations of a definite integral and it will lead us to the definition of the definite integral....\u00a0...To start off we are going to assume that we\u2019ve got a function ...\u00a0that is positive on some interval [...].\u00a0 What we want to do is determine the area of the region between the function and the ...-axis....\u00a0...It\u2019s probably easiest to see how we do this with an example.\u00a0 So let\u2019s determine the area between ...\u00a0on [0,2].\u00a0 In other words, we want to determine the area of the shaded region below....Now, at this point, we can\u2019t do this exactly.\u00a0 However, we can estimate the area.\u00a0 We will estimate the area by dividing up the interval into ... subintervals each of width,...\u00a0...Then in each interval we can form a rectangle whose height is given by the function value at a specific point in the interval.\u00a0 We can then find the area of each of these rectangles, add them up and this will be an estimate of the area....\u00a0...It\u2019s probably easier to see this with a sketch of the situation.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s divide up the interval into 4 subintervals and use the function value at the right endpoint of each interval to define the height of the rectangle.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...Note that by choosing the height as we did each of the rectangles will over estimate the area since each rectangle takes in more area than the graph each time.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s estimate the area.\u00a0 First, the width of each of the rectangles is ....\u00a0 The height of each rectangle is determined by the function value at the right endpoint and so the height of each rectangle is nothing more that the function value at the right endpoint.\u00a0 Here is the estimated area....\u00a0...Of course taking the rectangle heights to be the function value at the right endpoint is not our only option. \u00a0We could have taken the rectangle heights to be the function value at the left endpoint.\u00a0 Using the left endpoints as the heights of the rectangles will give the following graph and estimated area....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case we can see that the estimation will be an underestimation since each rectangle misses some of the area each time....\u00a0...There is one more common point for getting the heights of the rectangles that is often more accurate.\u00a0 Instead of using the right or left endpoints of each sub interval we could take the midpoint of each subinterval as the height of each rectangle.\u00a0 Here is the graph for this case....\u00a0...So, it looks like each rectangle will over and under estimate the area.\u00a0 This means that the approximation this time should be much better than the previous two choices of points.\u00a0 Here is the estimation for this case....\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ve now got three estimates.\u00a0 For comparison\u2019s sake the exact area is...\u00a0...So, both the right and left endpoint estimation did not do all that great of a job at the estimation.\u00a0 The midpoint estimation however did quite well....\u00a0...Be careful to not draw any conclusion about how choosing each of the points will affect our estimation.\u00a0 In this case, because we are working with an increasing function choosing the right endpoints will overestimate and choosing left endpoint will underestimate.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If we were to work with a decreasing function we would get the opposite results.\u00a0 For decreasing functions the right endpoints will underestimate and the left endpoints will overestimate....\u00a0...Also, if we had a function that both increased and decreased in the interval we would, in all likelihood, not even be able to determine if we would get an overestimation or underestimation. ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s suppose that we want a better estimation, because none of the estimations above really did all that great of a job at estimating the area.\u00a0 We could try to find a different point to use for the height of each rectangle but that would be cumbersome and there wouldn\u2019t be any guarantee that the estimation would in fact be better.\u00a0 Also, we would like a method for getting better approximations that would work for any function we would chose to work with and if we just pick new points that may not work for other functions....\u00a0...The easiest way to get a better approximation is to take more rectangles (... increase ...).\u00a0 Let\u2019s double the number of rectangles that we used and see what happens.\u00a0 Here are the graphs showing the eight rectangles and the estimations for each of the three choices for rectangle heights that we used above....\u00a0\u00a0 ...Here are the area estimations for each of these cases....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, increasing the number of rectangles did improve the accuracy of the estimation as we\u2019d guessed that it would....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a slightly more complicated example....\u00a0...Estimate   the area between ...\u00a0and the ...-axis   using ...\u00a0subintervals and all three cases above for   the heights of each rectangle....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s get the graph to make sure that the function   is positive....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the graph is positive and the width of each   subinterval will be,...\u00a0...This means that the endpoints of the subintervals are,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s first look at using the right endpoints for the   function height.\u00a0 Here is the graph for   this case....\u00a0...Notice, that unlike the first area we looked at, the   choosing the right endpoints here will both over and underestimate the area   depending on where we are on the curve.\u00a0   This will often be the case with a more general curve that the one we   initially looked at.\u00a0 The area   estimation using the right endpoints of each interval for the rectangle   height is,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at left endpoints for the function   height.\u00a0 Here is the graph....\u00a0...The area estimation using the left endpoints of each   interval for the rectangle height is,...\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s take a look at the midpoints for the   heights of each rectangle.\u00a0 Here is the   graph,...\u00a0...The area estimation using the midpoint is then,...\u00a0...For comparison purposes the exact area is,...\u00a0...So, again the midpoint did a better job than the other two.\u00a0 While this will be the case more often than not, it won\u2019t always be the case and so don\u2019t expect this to always happen....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s move on to the general case.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start out with ...\u00a0on [...] and we\u2019ll divide the interval into ... subintervals each of length,...\u00a0...Note that the subintervals don\u2019t have to be equal length, but it will make our work significantly easier.\u00a0 The endpoints of each subinterval are,...\u00a0...Next in each interval,...we choose a point ....\u00a0 These points will define the height of the rectangle in each subinterval.\u00a0 Note as well that these points do not have to occur at the same point in each subinterval.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of this situation....\u00a0...The area under the curve on the given interval is then approximately,...\u00a0...We will use ... or ... at this point to simplify up our notation a little.\u00a0 If you need a refresher on summation notation check out the ... devoted to this in the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Using summation notation the area estimation is,...The summation in the above equation is called a .......\u00a0...To get a better estimation we will take ... larger and larger.\u00a0 In fact, if we let ... go out to infinity we will get the exact area.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...Before leaving this section let\u2019s address one more issue.\u00a0 To this point we\u2019ve required the function to be positive in our work.\u00a0 Many functions are not positive however.\u00a0 Consider the case of ...on [0,2].\u00a0 If we use ...\u00a0and the midpoints for the rectangle height we get the following graph,...\u00a0...In this case let\u2019s notice that the function lies completely below the ...-axis and hence is always negative.\u00a0 If we ignore the fact that the function is always negative and use the same ideas above to estimate the area between the graph and the ...-axis we get,...\u00a0...Our answer is negative as we might have expected given that all the function evaluations are negative.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, using the technique in this section it looks like if the function is above the ...-axis we will get a positive area and if the function is below the ...-axis we will get a negative area.\u00a0 Now, what about a function that is both positive and negative in the interval?\u00a0 For example, ...\u00a0on [0,2].\u00a0 Using ...\u00a0and midpoints the graph is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Some of the rectangles are below the ...-axis and so will give negative areas while some are above the ...-axis and will give positive areas.\u00a0 Since more rectangles are below the ...-axis than above it looks like we should probably get a negative area estimation for this case.\u00a0 In fact that is correct.\u00a0 Here the area estimation for this case....\u00a0...In cases where the function is both above and below the ...-axis the technique given in the section will give the ... area between the function and the ...-axis with areas below the ...-axis negative and areas above the ...-axis positive.\u00a0 So, if the net area is negative then there is more area

Since the sequence is neither an increasing nor decreasing sequence   it is not a monotonic sequence.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The sequence is bounded however since it is bounded above   by 1 and bounded below by -1.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Again, we can note that this sequence is also divergent....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This sequence is a decreasing sequence (and hence   monotonic) since,...The terms in this sequence are all positive and so it is   bounded below by zero.\u00a0 Also, since the   sequence is a decreasing sequence the first sequence term will be the largest   and so we can see that the sequence will also be bounded above by ....\u00a0 Therefore, this sequence is bounded....\u00a0...We can also take a quick limit and note that this sequence   converges and its limit is zero....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s work a couple more examples that are designed to make sure that we don\u2019t get too used to relying on our intuition with these problems.\u00a0 As we noted in the previous section our intuition can often lead us astray with some of the concepts we\u2019ll be looking at in this chapter....\u00a0...Determine   if the following sequences are monotonic and/or bounded....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll start with the bounded part of this example first   and then come back and deal with the increasing/decreasing question since   that is where students often make mistakes with this type of sequence.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, ... is   positive and so the sequence terms are all positive.\u00a0 The sequence is therefore bounded below by   zero.\u00a0 Likewise each sequence term is   the quotient of a number divided by a larger number and so is guaranteed to   be less than one.\u00a0 The sequence is then   bounded above by one.\u00a0 So, this   sequence is bounded....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s think about the monotonic question.\u00a0 First, students will often make the mistake   of assuming that because the denominator is larger the quotient must be   decreasing.\u00a0 This will not always be   the case and in this case we would be wrong.\u00a0   This sequence is increasing as we\u2019ll see....\u00a0...To determine the increasing/decreasing nature of this   sequence we will need to resort to Calculus I ....\u00a0 First consider the following function and   its derivative....\u00a0...We can see that the first derivative is always positive   and so from Calculus I we know that the function must then be an increasing   function.\u00a0 So, how does this help   us?\u00a0 Notice that,...\u00a0...Therefore because ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is increasing we can also say that,...\u00a0...In other words, the sequence must be increasing.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that now that we know the sequence is an increasing   sequence we can get a better lower bound for the sequence.\u00a0 Since the sequence is increasing the first   term in the sequence must be the smallest term and so since we are starting   at ...\u00a0we could also use a lower bound of ...\u00a0for this sequence.\u00a0 It is important to remember that any number   that is always less than or equal to all the sequence terms can be a lower   bound.\u00a0 Some are better than others   however....\u00a0...A quick limit will also tell us that this sequence   converges with a limit of 1....\u00a0...Before moving on to the next part there is a natural   question that many students will have at this point.\u00a0 Why did we use Calculus to determine the   increasing/decreasing nature of the sequence when we could have just plugged   in a couple of ...\u2019s and quickly   determined the same thing?...\u00a0...The answer to this question is the next part of this   example!...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This is a messy looking sequence, but it needs to be in   order to make the point of this part. ...\u00a0...First, notice that, as with the previous part, the   sequence terms are all positive and will all be less than one (since the   numerator is guaranteed to be less than the denominator) and so the sequence   is bounded....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s move on to the increasing/decreasing   question.\u00a0 As with the last problem,   many students will look at the exponents in the numerator and denominator and   determine based on that that sequence terms must decrease....\u00a0...This however, isn\u2019t a decreasing sequence.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at the first few terms to   see this....\u00a0...The first 10 terms of this sequence are all increasing and   so clearly the sequence can\u2019t be a decreasing sequence.\u00a0 Recall that a sequence can only be   decreasing if ALL the terms are decreasing....\u00a0...Now, we can\u2019t make another common mistake and assume that   because the first few terms increase then whole sequence must also   increase.\u00a0 If we did that we would also   be mistaken as this is also not an increasing sequence....\u00a0...This sequence is neither decreasing or increasing.\u00a0 The only sure way to see this is to do the   Calculus I approach to increasing/decreasing functions....\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ll need the following function and its   derivative....\u00a0...This function will have the following three ...,...\u00a0...Why critical points?\u00a0   Remember these are the only places where the function ... change sign!\u00a0 Our sequence starts at ...\u00a0and so we can ignore the third one since it   lies outside the values of ... that   we\u2019re considering.\u00a0 By plugging in some   test values of ... we can quickly   determine that the derivative is positive for ...\u00a0and so the function is increasing in this   range.\u00a0 Likewise, we can see that the   derivative is negative for ...\u00a0and so the function will be decreasing in   this range....\u00a0...So, our sequence will be increasing for ...\u00a0and decreasing for ....\u00a0 Therefore the function is not monotonic....\u00a0...Finally, note that this sequence will also converge and   has a limit of zero....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, as the last example has shown we need to be careful in making assumptions about sequences.\u00a0 Our intuition will often not be sufficient to get the correct answer and we can NEVER make assumptions about a sequence based on the value of the first few terms.\u00a0 As the last part has shown there are sequences which will increase or decrease for a few terms and then change direction after that.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note as well that we said \u201cfirst few terms\u201d here, but it is completely possible for a sequence to decrease for the first 10,000 terms and then start increasing for the remaining terms.\u00a0 In other words, there is no \u201cmagical\u201d value of ... for which all we have to do is check up to that point and then we\u2019ll know what the whole sequence will do....\u00a0...The only time that we\u2019ll be able to avoid using Calculus I techniques to determine the increasing/decreasing nature of a sequence is in sequences like part (c) of Example 1.\u00a0 In this case increasing ... only changed (in fact increased) the denominator and so we were able to determine the behavior of the sequence based on that....\u00a0...In Example 2 however, increasing ... increased both the denominator and the numerator.\u00a0 In cases like this there is no way to determine which increase will \u201cwin out\u201d and cause the sequence terms to increase or decrease and so we need to resort to Calculus I techniques to answer the question....\u00a0...We\u2019ll close out this section with a nice theorem that we\u2019ll use in some of the proofs later in this chapter....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is bounded and monotonic then ...\u00a0is convergent....\u00a0...Be careful to not misuse this theorem.\u00a0 It does not say that if a sequence is not bounded and/or not monotonic that it is divergent.\u00a0 Example 2b is a good case in point.\u00a0 The sequence in that example was not monotonic but it does converge....\u00a0...Note as well that we can make several variants of this theorem.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0is bounded above and increasing then it converges and likewise if ...\u00a0is bounded below and decreasing then it converges.", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to concentrate on how we actually evaluate definite integrals in practice.\u00a0 To do this we will need the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part II....\u00a0...Suppose ...\u00a0is a continuous function on [...] and also suppose that ...\u00a0is any anti-derivative for ....\u00a0 Then,...\u00a0...To see the proof of this see the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Recall that when we talk about an anti-derivative for a function we are really talking about the indefinite integral for the function.\u00a0 So, to evaluate a definite integral the first thing that we\u2019re going to do is evaluate the indefinite integral for the function.\u00a0 This should explain the similarity in the notations for the indefinite and definite integrals....\u00a0...Also notice that we require the function to be continuous in the interval of integration.\u00a0 This was also a requirement in the definition of the definite integral.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t make a big deal about this in the last section.\u00a0 In this section however, we will need to keep this condition in mind as we do our evaluations....\u00a0...Next let\u2019s address the fact that we can use any anti-derivative of ...\u00a0in the evaluation.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a final look at the following integral....\u00a0...Both of the following are anti-derivatives of the integrand....\u00a0...Using the FToC to evaluate this integral with the first anti-derivatives gives,...\u00a0...Much easier than ... wasn\u2019t it?\u00a0 Let\u2019s now use the second anti-derivative to evaluate this definite integral....\u00a0...The constant that we tacked onto the second anti-derivative canceled in the evaluation step.\u00a0 So, when choosing the anti-derivative to use in the evaluation process make your life easier and don\u2019t bother with the constant as it will only end up canceling in the long run....\u00a0...Also, note that we\u2019re going to have to be very careful with minus signs and parenthesis with these problems.\u00a0 It\u2019s very easy to get in a hurry and mess them up....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start our examples with the following set designed to make a couple of quick points that are very important....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...This is the only indefinite integral in this section and   by now we should be getting pretty good with these so we won\u2019t spend a lot of   time on this part.\u00a0 This is here only   to make sure that we understand the difference between an indefinite and a   definite integral.\u00a0 The integral is,...\u00a0... ...Recall from our first example above that all we really   need here is any anti-derivative of the integrand.\u00a0 We just computed the most general   anti-derivative in the first part so we can use that if we want to.\u00a0 However, recall that as we noted above any   constants we tack on will just cancel in the long run and so we\u2019ll use the   answer from (a) without the \u201c+...\u201d....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the integral,...\u00a0...Remember that the evaluation is always done in the order   of evaluation at the upper limit minus evaluation at the lower limit.\u00a0 Also be very careful with minus signs and   parenthesis.\u00a0 It\u2019s very easy to forget   them or mishandle them and get the wrong answer....\u00a0...Notice as well that, in order to help with the evaluation,   we rewrote the indefinite integral a little.\u00a0   In particular we got rid of the negative exponent on the second   term.\u00a0 It\u2019s generally easier to   evaluate the term with positive exponents....\u00a0... ...This integral is here to make a point.\u00a0 Recall that in order for us to do an   integral the integrand must be continuous in the range of the limits.\u00a0 In this case the second term will have   division by zero at ...\u00a0and since ...\u00a0is in the interval of integration, ... it is between the lower and upper   limit, this integrand is not continuous in the interval of integration and so   we can\u2019t do this integral....\u00a0...Note that this problem will not prevent us from doing the   integral in (b) since ...\u00a0is not in the interval of integration....\u00a0...So what have we learned from this example?...\u00a0...First, in order to do a definite integral the first thing that we need to do is the indefinite integral.\u00a0 So we aren\u2019t going to get out of doing indefinite integrals, they will be in every integral that we\u2019ll be doing in the rest of this course so make sure that you\u2019re getting good at computing them....\u00a0...Second, we need to be on the lookout for functions that aren\u2019t continuous at any point between the limits of integration.\u00a0 Also, it\u2019s important to note that this will only be a problem if the point(s) of discontinuity occur between the limits of integration or at the limits themselves.\u00a0 If the point of discontinuity occurs outside of the limits of integration the integral can still be evaluated....\u00a0...In the following sets of examples we won\u2019t make too much of an issue with continuity problems, or lack of continuity problems, unless it affects the evaluation of the integral.\u00a0 Do not let this convince you that you don\u2019t need to worry about this idea.\u00a0 It arises often enough that it can cause real problems if you aren\u2019t on the lookout for it....\u00a0...Finally, note the difference between indefinite and definite integrals.\u00a0 Indefinite integrals are functions while definite integrals are numbers....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...There isn\u2019t a lot to this one other than simply doing the   work.... ...Recall that we can\u2019t integrate products as a product of   integrals and so we first need to multiply the integrand out before   integrating, just as we did in the indefinite integral case....In the evaluation process recall that,...\u00a0...Also, don\u2019t get excited about the fact that the lower   limit of integration is larger than the upper limit of integration.\u00a0 That will happen on occasion and there is   absolutely nothing wrong with this....\u00a0... ...First, notice that we will have a division by zero issue   at ...,   but since this isn\u2019t in the interval of integration we won\u2019t have to worry   about it....\u00a0...Next again recall that we can\u2019t integrate quotients as a   quotient of integrals and so the first step that we\u2019ll need to do is break up   the quotient so we can integrate the function....\u00a0...Don\u2019t get excited about answers that don\u2019t come down to a   simple integer or fraction.\u00a0 Often   times they won\u2019t.\u00a0 Also don\u2019t forget   that .......\u00a0... ...This one is actually pretty easy.\u00a0 Recall that we\u2019re just integrating 1!....\u00a0...The last set of examples dealt exclusively with integrating powers of ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s work a couple of examples that involve other functions....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... .......This one is here mostly here to contrast with the next   example.... ...Be careful with signs with this one.\u00a0 Recall from the indefinite integral   sections that it\u2019s easy to mess up the signs when integrating sine and   cosine....\u00a0...Compare this answer to the previous answer, especially the   evaluation at zero.\u00a0 It\u2019s very easy to   get into the habit of just writing down zero when evaluating a function at   zero.\u00a0 This is especially a problem   when many of the functions that we integrate involve only ...\u2019s raised to positive integers; these evaluate is zero of course.\u00a0   After evaluating many of these kinds of definite integrals it\u2019s easy   to get into the habit of just writing down zero when you evaluate at   zero.\u00a0 However, there are many   functions out there that aren\u2019t zero when evaluated at zero so be careful....\u00a0... ...Not much to do other than do the integral....\u00a0...For the evaluation, recall that...and so if we can evaluate cosine at these angles we can   evaluate secant at these angles....\u00a0... ...In order to do this one will need to rewrite both of the   terms in the integral a little as follows,...For the first term recall we used the following fact about   exponents....\u00a0...In the second term, taking the 3 out of the denominator will   just make integrating that term easier....\u00a0...Now the integral....Just leave the answer like this.\u00a0 It\u2019s messy, but it\u2019s also exact....\u00a0...Note that the absolute value bars on the logarithm are   required here.\u00a0 Without them we   couldn\u2019t have done the evaluation.\u00a0 ... ...This integral can\u2019t be done.\u00a0 There is division by zero in the third term   at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0\u00a0lies in the interval of integration.\u00a0 The fact that the first two terms can be   integrated doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 If even one   term in the integral can\u2019t be integrated then the whole integral can\u2019t be   done....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve computed a fair number of definite integrals at this point.\u00a0 Remember that the vast majority of the work in computing them is first finding the indefinite integral.\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve found that the rest is just some number crunching.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are a couple of particularly tricky definite integrals that we need to take a look at next.\u00a0 Actually they are only tricky until you see how to do them, so don\u2019t get too excited about them.\u00a0 The first one involves integrating a piecewise function....\u00a0...Given,...Evaluate each of the following integrals....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Let\u2019s first start with a graph of this function....\u00a0...The graph reveals a problem.\u00a0 This function is not continuous at ...and we\u2019re going to have to watch out   for that....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...For this integral notice that ...\u00a0is not in the interval of integration and so   that is something that we\u2019ll not need to worry about in this part.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also note the limits for the integral lie entirely in the   range for the first function.\u00a0 What   this means for us is that when we do the integral all we need to do is plug   in the first function into the integral....\u00a0...Here is the integral....\u00a0... ...In this part ...\u00a0is between the limits of integration.\u00a0 This means that the integrand is no longer   continuous in the interval of integration and that is a show stopper as far   we\u2019re concerned.\u00a0 As noted above we   simply can\u2019t integrate functions that aren\u2019t continuous in the interval of   integration....\u00a0...Also, even if the function was continuous at ...\u00a0we would still have the problem that the   function is actually two different equations depending where we are in the   interval of integration....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first address the problem of the function not   being continuous at ....\u00a0 As we\u2019ll see, in this case, if we can find   a way around this problem the second problem will also get taken care of at   the same time....\u00a0...In the previous examples where we had functions that   weren\u2019t continuous we had division by zero and no matter how hard we try we   can\u2019t get rid of that problem.\u00a0   Division by zero is a real problem and we can\u2019t really avoid it.\u00a0 In this case the discontinuity does not   stem from problems with the function not existing at ....\u00a0 Instead the function is not continuous   because it takes on different values on either sides of ....\u00a0 We can \u201cremove\u201d this problem by recalling ... from the   previous section.\u00a0 This property tells   us that we can write the integral as follows,...\u00a0...On each of these intervals the function is   continuous.\u00a0 In fact we can say   more.\u00a0 In the first integral we will   have ... between -2 and 1 and this   means that we can use the second equation for ...\u00a0and likewise for the second integral ... will be between 1 and 3 and so we   can use the first function for ....\u00a0 The integral in this case is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, to integrate a piecewise function, all we need to do is break up the integral at the break point(s) that happen to occur in the interval of integration and then integrate each piece....\u00a0...Next we need to look at is how to integrate an absolute value function....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....Recall that the point behind indefinite integration (which   we\u2019ll need to do in this problem) is to determine what function we   differentiated to get the integrand.\u00a0   To this point we\u2019ve not seen any functions that will differentiate to   get an absolute value nor will we ever see a function that will differentiate   to get an absolute value....\u00a0...The only way that we can do this problem is to get rid of   the absolute value.\u00a0 To do this we need   to recall the definition of absolute value....\u00a0...Once we remember that we can define absolute value as a   piecewise function we can use the work from Example 4 as a guide for doing   this integral....\u00a0...What we need to do is determine where the quantity on the   inside of the absolute value bars is negative and where it is positive.\u00a0 It looks like if ...the quantity inside the absolute   value is positive and if ...the quantity inside the absolute   value is negative.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, note that ...\u00a0is in the interval of integration and so, if   we break up the integral at this point we get,...\u00a0...Now, in the first integrals we have ...\u00a0and so ...\u00a0in this interval of integration.\u00a0 That means we can drop the absolute value   bars if we put in a minus sign.\u00a0   Likewise in the second integral we have ...\u00a0which means that in this interval of   integration we have ...\u00a0and so we can just drop the absolute value   bars in this integral....\u00a0...After getting rid of the absolute value bars in each   integral we can do each integral.\u00a0 So,   doing the integration gives,...\u00a0...Integrating absolute value functions isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 It\u2019s a little more work than the \u201cstandard\u201d definite integral, but it\u2019s not really all that much more work.\u00a0 First, determine where the quantity inside the absolute value bars is negative and where it is positive.\u00a0 When we\u2019ve determined that point all we need to do is break up the integral so that in each range of limits the quantity inside the absolute value bars is always positive or always negative.\u00a0 Once this is done we can drop the absolute value bars (adding negative signs when the quantity is negative) and then we can do the integral as we\u2019ve always done.", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we will formally define the definite integral and give many of the properties of definite integrals.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off with the definition of a definite integral....\u00a0...Given a function ...\u00a0that is continuous on the interval [...] we divide the interval into ... subintervals of equal width, ...,   and from each interval choose a point, ....\u00a0 Then the ... is...\u00a0...The definite integral is defined to be exactly the limit and summation that we looked at in the last section to find the net area between a function and the ...-axis.\u00a0 Also note that the notation for the definite integral is very similar to the notation for an indefinite integral.\u00a0 The reason for this will be apparent eventually....\u00a0...There is also a little bit of terminology that we should get out of the way here.\u00a0 The number \u201c...\u201d that is at the bottom of the integral sign is called the ... of the integral and the number \u201c...\u201d at the top of the integral sign is called the ... of the integral.\u00a0 Also, despite the fact that ... and ... were given as an interval the lower limit does not necessarily need to be smaller than the upper limit.\u00a0 Collectively we\u2019ll often call ... and ... the .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a quick example.\u00a0 This example will use many of the properties and facts from the brief review of ... in the Extras chapter.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Using   the definition of the definite integral compute the following....First, we can\u2019t actually use the definition unless we   determine which points in each interval that well use for ....\u00a0 In order to make our life easier we\u2019ll use   the right endpoints of each interval....\u00a0...From the previous section we know that for a general ... the width of each subinterval is,...The subintervals are then,...\u00a0...As we can see the right endpoint of the ... subinterval is...\u00a0...The summation in the definition of the definite integral   is then,...\u00a0...Now, we are going to have to take a limit of this.\u00a0 That means that we are going to need to   \u201cevaluate\u201d this summation.\u00a0 In other   words, we are going to have to use the formulas given in the ... review to eliminate the   actual summation and get a formula for this for a general .......\u00a0...To do this we will need to recognize that ... is a constant as far as the   summation notation is concerned.\u00a0 As we   cycle through the integers from 1 to ...   in the summation only ... changes and   so anything that isn\u2019t an ... will be   a constant and can be factored out of the summation.\u00a0 In particular any ... that is in the summation can be factored out if we need to....\u00a0...Here is the summation \u201cevaluation\u201d....\u00a0...We can now compute the definite integral....We\u2019ve seen several methods for dealing with the limit in   this problem so I\u2019ll leave it to you to verify the results....\u00a0...Wow, that was a lot of work for a fairly simple function.\u00a0 There is a much simpler way of evaluating these and we will get to it eventually.\u00a0 The main purpose to this section is to get the main properties and facts about the definite integral out of the way.\u00a0 We\u2019ll discuss how we compute these in practice starting with the next section....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start taking a look at some of the properties of the definite integral....\u00a0...1.....\u00a0 We can interchange the limits on any   definite integral, all that we need to do is tack a minus sign onto the   integral when we do.\u00a0 ...   ...   ...2.....\u00a0 If the upper and lower limits are the same   then there is no work to do, the integral is zero....   ...   ...3....,   where ... is any number.\u00a0 So, as with limits, derivatives, and   indefinite integrals we can factor out a constant....   ...   ...4.....\u00a0 We can break up definite integrals across a   sum or difference....   ...   ...5....\u00a0where ...   is any number.\u00a0 This property is more   important than we might realize at first.\u00a0   One of the main uses of this property is to tell us how we can integrate   a function over the adjacent intervals, [...]   and [...].\u00a0 Note however that ... doesn\u2019t need to be between ...   and .......   ...   ...6.....\u00a0 The point of this property is to notice   that as long as the function and limits are the same the variable of   integration that we use in the definite integral won\u2019t affect the answer....\u00a0...See the ... section of the Extras chapter for the proof of properties 1 ...\u00a04.\u00a0 Property 5 is not easy to prove and so is not shown there.\u00a0 Property 6 is not really a property in the full sense of the word.\u00a0 It is only here to acknowledge that as long as the function and limits are the same it doesn\u2019t matter what letter we use for the variable.\u00a0 The answer will be the same....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a couple of examples dealing with these properties....\u00a0...Use   the results from the first example to evaluate each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...All of the solutions to these problems will rely on the   fact we proved in the first example.\u00a0   Namely that,... ...In this case the only difference between the two is that   the limits have interchanged.\u00a0 So,   using the first property gives,...\u00a0... ...For this part notice that we can factor a 10 out of both   terms and then out of the integral using the third property....\u00a0... ...In this case the only difference is the letter used and so   this is just going to use property 6....\u00a0...Here are a couple of examples using the other properties....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following definite integral....There really isn\u2019t anything to do with this integral once   we notice that the limits are the same.\u00a0   Using the second property this is,...\u00a0...Given   that ...\u00a0and ...determine the value of...We will first need to use the fourth property to break up   the integral and the third property to factor out the constants....\u00a0...Now notice that the limits on the first integral are   interchanged with the limits on the given integral so switch them using the   first property above (and adding a minus sign of course).\u00a0 Once this is done we can plug in the known   values of the integrals....\u00a0...\u00a0...Given   that ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0determine the value of .......This example is mostly an example of property 5 although   there are a couple of uses of property 1 in the solution as well....\u00a0...We need to figure out how to correctly break up the   integral using property 5 to allow us to use the given pieces of   information.\u00a0 First we\u2019ll note that   there is an integral that has a \u201c-5\u201d in one of the limits.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the lower limit, but we can use   property 1 to correct that eventually.\u00a0   The other limit is 100 so this is the number ... that we\u2019ll use in property 5....\u00a0...We\u2019ll be able to get the value of the first integral, but   the second still isn\u2019t in the list of know integrals.\u00a0 However, we do have second limit that has a   limit of 100 in it.\u00a0 The other limit   for this second integral is -10 and this will be ... in this application of property 5....\u00a0...At this point all that we need to do is use the property 1   on the first and third integral to get the limits to match up with the known   integrals.\u00a0 After that we can plug in   for the known integrals....\u00a0...There are also some nice properties that we can use in comparing the general size of definite integrals.\u00a0 Here they are....\u00a0...7....,   ... is any number....8....If   ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0then ....   ...9....\u00a0\u00a0If ...\u00a0for ...then .......10....If ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0then .......11....\u00a0...\u00a0...See the ... section of the Extras chapter for the proof of these properties.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are a couple of quick interpretations of the definite integral that we can give here....\u00a0...First, as we alluded to in the previous section one possible interpretation of the definite integral is to give the net area between the graph of ...\u00a0and the ...-axis on the interval [...].\u00a0 So, the net area between the graph of ...\u00a0and the ...-axis on [0,2] is,...\u00a0...If you look back in the last section this was the exact area that was given for the initial set of problems that we looked at in this area....\u00a0...Another interpretation is sometimes called the Net Change Theorem.\u00a0 This interpretation says that if ...\u00a0is some quantity (so ...\u00a0is the rate of change of ..., then,...\u00a0is the net change in ...\u00a0on the interval [...,...].\u00a0 In other words, compute the definite integral of a rate of change and you\u2019ll get the net change in the quantity.\u00a0 We can see that the value of the definite integral, ..., does in fact give use the net change in ...\u00a0and so there really isn\u2019t anything to prove with this statement.\u00a0 This is really just an acknowledgment of what the definite integral of a rate of change tells us....\u00a0...So as a quick example, if ...\u00a0is the volume of water in a tank then,...is the net change in the volume as we go from time ...\u00a0to time .......\u00a0...Likewise, if ...\u00a0is the function giving the position of some object at time ... we know that the velocity of the object at any time ... is : ....\u00a0 Therefore the displacement of the object time ...\u00a0to time ...\u00a0is,...Note that in this case if ...\u00a0is both positive and negative (... the object moves to both the right and left) in the time frame this will NOT give the total distance traveled.\u00a0 It will only give the displacement, ... the difference between where the object started and where it ended up.\u00a0 To get the total distance traveled by an object we\u2019d have to compute,...\u00a0...It is important to note here that the Net Change Theorem only really makes sense if we\u2019re integrating a derivative of a function....\u00a0...As noted by the title above this is only the first part to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\u00a0 We will give the second part in the next section as it is the key to easily computing definite integrals and that is the subject of the next section....\u00a0...The first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us how to differentiate certain types of definite integrals and it also tells us about the very close relationship between integrals and derivatives....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is continuous on [...] then,...is continuous on [...]   and it is differentiable on ...\u00a0and that,...\u00a0...An alternate notation for the derivative portion of this is,...\u00a0...To see the proof of this see the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check out a couple of quick examples using this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...This one is nothing more than a quick application of the   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus....\u00a0... ...This one needs a little work before we can use the   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\u00a0 The   first thing to notice is that the FToC requires the lower limit to be a   constant and the upper limit to be the variable.\u00a0 So, using a property of definite integrals   we can interchange the limits of the integral we just need to remember to add   in a minus sign after we do that.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The next thing to notice is that the FToC also requires an   ... in the upper limit of integration   and we\u2019ve got ....\u00a0 To do this derivative we\u2019re going to need   the following version of the .......\u00a0...So, if we let ...   we use the chain rule to get,...\u00a0...The final step is to get everything back in terms of .......\u00a0...Using the chain rule as we did in the last part of this example we can derive some general formulas for some more complicated problems....\u00a0...First,...\u00a0...This is simply the chain rule for these kinds of problems....\u00a0...Next, we can get a formula for integrals in which the upper limit is a constant and the lower limit is a function of ....\u00a0 All we need to do here is interchange the limits on the integral (adding in a minus sign of course) and then using the formula above to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Finally, we can also get a version for both limits being functions of ....\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll need to use Property 5 above to break up the integral as follows,...\u00a0...We can use pretty much any value of ... when we break up the integral.\u00a0 The only thing that we need to avoid is to make sure that ...\u00a0exists.\u00a0 So, assuming that ...\u00a0exists after we break up the integral we can then differentiate and use the two formulas above to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a quick example....\u00a0...Differentiate   the following integral....This will use the final formula that we derived above.", "url":

We have the following properties....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are both convergent series then,...\u00a0...   ...   .......\u00a0...The first property is simply telling us that we can always factor a multiplicative constant out of an infinite series and again recall that if we don\u2019t put in an initial value of the index that the series can start at any value.\u00a0 Also recall that in these cases we won\u2019t put an infinity at the top either....\u00a0...The second property says that if we add/subtract series all we really need to do is add/subtract the series terms.\u00a0 Note as well that in order to add/subtract series we need to make sure that both have the same initial value of the index and the new series will also start at this value....\u00a0...Before we move on to a different topic let\u2019s discuss multiplication of series briefly.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start both series at ...\u00a0for a later formula and then note that,...\u00a0...To convince yourself that this isn\u2019t true consider the following product of two finite sums....Yeah, it was just the multiplication of two polynomials.\u00a0 Each is a finite sum and so it makes the point.\u00a0 In doing the multiplication we didn\u2019t just multiply the constant terms, then the ... terms, ....\u00a0 Instead we had to distribute the 2 through the second polynomial, then distribute the ... through the second polynomial and finally combine like terms....\u00a0...Multiplying infinite series (even though we said we can\u2019t think of an infinite series as an infinite sum) needs to be done in the same manner.\u00a0 With multiplication we\u2019re really asking us to do the following,...\u00a0...To do this multiplication we would have to distribute the ... through the second term, distribute the ... through, ... then combine like terms.\u00a0 This is pretty much impossible since both series have an infinite set of terms in them, however the following formula can be used to determine the product of two series....\u00a0...The next topic that we need to discuss in this section is that of ....\u00a0 To be honest this is not a topic that we\u2019ll see all that often in this course.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ll use it once in the next section and then not use it again in all likelihood.\u00a0 Despite the fact that we won\u2019t use it much in this course doesn\u2019t mean however that it isn\u2019t used often in other classes where you might run across series.\u00a0 So, we will cover it briefly here so that you can say you\u2019ve seen it....\u00a0...The basic idea behind index shifts is to start a series at a different value for whatever the reason (and yes, there are legitimate reasons for doing that)....\u00a0...Consider the following series,...\u00a0...Suppose that for some reason we wanted to start this series at ..., but we didn\u2019t want to change the value of the series.\u00a0 This means that we can\u2019t just change the ...\u00a0to ...\u00a0as this would add in two new terms to the series and thus change its value....\u00a0...Performing an index shift is a fairly simple process to do.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start by defining a new index, say ..., as follows,...\u00a0...Now, when ..., we will get ....\u00a0 Notice as well that if ...\u00a0then ..., so only the lower limit will change here.\u00a0 Next, we can solve this for ... to get,...\u00a0...We can now completely rewrite the series in terms of the index ... instead of the index ... simply by plugging in our equation for ... in terms of .......\u00a0...To finish the problem out we\u2019ll recall that the letter we used for the index doesn\u2019t matter and so we\u2019ll change the final ... back into an ... to get,...\u00a0...To convince yourselves that these really are the same summation let\u2019s write out the first couple of terms for each of them,...\u00a0...So, sure enough the two series do have exactly the same terms....\u00a0...There is actually an easier way to do an index shift.\u00a0 The method given above is the technically correct way of doing an index shift.\u00a0 However, notice in the above example we decreased the initial value of the index by 2 and all the ...\u2019s in the series terms increased by 2 as well....\u00a0...This will always work in this manner.\u00a0 If we decrease the initial value of the index by a set amount then all the other ...\u2019s in the series term will increase by the same amount.\u00a0 Likewise, if we increase the initial value of the index by a set amount, then all the ...\u2019s in the series term will decrease by the same amount....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a couple of examples using this shorthand method for doing index shifts....\u00a0...Perform   the following index shifts....Write   ...\u00a0as a series that starts at .......Write   ...\u00a0as a series that starts at ....... In this   case we need to decrease the initial value by 1 and so the ...\u2019s (okay the single ...) in the term must increase by 1 as   well....\u00a0... For this   problem we want to increase the initial value by 2 and so all the ...\u2019s in the series term must decrease   by 2....\u00a0...The final topic in this section is again a topic that we\u2019ll not be seeing all that often in this class, although we will be seeing it more often than the index shifts.\u00a0 This final topic is really more about alternate ways to write series when the situation requires it....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the following series and note that the ...\u00a0starting point is only for convenience since we need to start the series somewhere.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that if we ignore the first term the remaining terms will also be a series that will start at ...\u00a0instead of ...\u00a0\u00a0So, we can rewrite the original series as follows,...\u00a0...In this example we say that we\u2019ve stripped out the first term....\u00a0...We could have stripped out more terms if we wanted to.\u00a0 In the following series we\u2019ve stripped out the first two terms and the first four terms respectively....\u00a0...Being able to strip out terms will, on occasion, simplify our work or allow us to reuse a prior result so it\u2019s an important idea to remember....\u00a0...Notice that in the second example above we could have also denoted the four terms that we stripped out as a finite series as follows,...\u00a0...This is a convenient notation when we are stripping out a large number of terms or if we need to strip out an undetermined number of terms.\u00a0 In general, we can write a series as follows,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave this section with an important warning about terminology.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get sequences and series confused!\u00a0 A sequence is a list of numbers written in a specific order while an infinite series is a limit of a sequence of finite series and hence, if it exists will be a single value.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, once again, a sequence is a list of numbers while a series is a single number, provided it makes sense to even compute the series.\u00a0 Students will often confuse the two and try to use facts pertaining to one on the other.\u00a0 However, since they are different beasts this just won\u2019t work.\u00a0 There will be problems where we are using both sequences and series so we\u2019ll always have to remember that they are different.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/Series_Basics.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus II - Series - The Basics", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the previous section we spent some time getting familiar with series and we briefly defined convergence and divergence.\u00a0 Before worrying about convergence and divergence of a series we wanted to make sure that we\u2019ve started to get comfortable with the notation involved in series and some of the various manipulations of series that we will, on occasion, need to be able to do....\u00a0...As noted in the previous section most of what we were doing there won\u2019t be done much in this chapter.\u00a0 So, it is now time to start talking about the convergence and divergence of a series as this will be a topic that we\u2019ll be dealing with to one extent or another in almost all of the remaining sections of this chapter....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s recap just what an infinite series is and what it means for a series to be convergent or divergent.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with a sequence ...\u00a0and again note that we\u2019re starting the sequence at ...\u00a0only for the sake of convenience and it can, in fact, be anything....\u00a0...Next we define the partial sums of the series as,...and these form a new sequence, .......\u00a0...An infinite series, or just series here since almost every series that we'll be looking at will be an infinite series, is then the limit of the partial sums.\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...If the sequence of partial sums is a convergent sequence (... its limit exists and is finite) then the series is also called ...and in this case if ...\u00a0then, ....\u00a0 Likewise, if the sequence of partial sums is a divergent sequence (... its limit doesn\u2019t exist or is plus or minus infinity) then the series is also called .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some series and see if we can determine if they are convergent or divergent and see if we can determine the value of any convergent series we find....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 If it converges determine its value....To determine if the series is convergent we first need to   get our hands on a formula for the general term in the sequence of partial   sums....\u00a0...This is a known series and its value can be shown to be,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t know this formula (I\u2019d be   surprised if anyone knew it\u2026) as you won\u2019t be required to know it in my   course....\u00a0...So, to determine if the series is convergent we will first   need to see if the sequence of partial sums,...is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 That\u2019s not terribly difficult in this   case.\u00a0 The limit of the sequence terms   is,...\u00a0...Therefore, the sequence of partial sums diverges to ...\u00a0and so the series also diverges.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, as we saw in this example we had to know a fairly obscure formula in order to determine the convergence of this series.\u00a0 In general finding a formula for the general term in the sequence of partial sums is a very difficult process.\u00a0 In fact after the next section we\u2019ll not be doing much with the partial sums of series due to the extreme difficulty faced in finding the general formula.\u00a0 This also means that we\u2019ll not be doing much work with the value of series since in order to get the value we\u2019ll also need to know the general formula for the partial sums....\u00a0...We will continue with a few more examples however, since this is technically how we determine convergence and the value of a series.\u00a0 Also, the remaining examples we\u2019ll be looking at in this section will lead us to a very important fact about the convergence of series....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s take a look at a couple more examples....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges.\u00a0 If it converges determine its sum....This is actually one of the few series in which we are   able to determine a formula for the general term in the sequence of partial   fractions.\u00a0 However, in this section we   are more interested in the general idea of convergence and divergence and so   we\u2019ll put off discussing the process for finding the formula until the next   section....\u00a0...The general formula for the partial sums is,...and in this case we have,...\u00a0...The sequence of partial sums converges and so the series   converges also and its value is,...\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges.\u00a0 If it converges determine its sum....In this case we really don\u2019t need a general formula for   the partial sums to determine the convergence of this series.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just write down the first few partial   sums....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it looks like the sequence of partial sums is,...and this sequence diverges since ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 Therefore, the series also diverges.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Determine   if the following series converges or diverges.\u00a0 If it converges determine its sum....Here is the general formula for the partial sums for this   series....\u00a0...Again, do not worry about knowing this formula.\u00a0 This is not something that you\u2019ll ever be   asked to know in my class....\u00a0...In this case the limit of the sequence of partial sums is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The sequence of partial sums is convergent and so the   series will also be convergent.\u00a0 The   value of the series is,...\u00a0...As we already noted, do not get excited about determining the general formula for the sequence of partial sums.\u00a0 There is only going to be one type of series where you will need to determine this formula and the process in that case isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 In fact, you already know how to do most of the work in the process as you\u2019ll see in the next section....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve determined the convergence of four series now.\u00a0 Two of the series converged and two diverged.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go back and examine the series terms for each of these.\u00a0 For each of the series let\u2019s take the limit as ... goes to infinity of the series terms (not the partial sums!!)....\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that for the two series that converged the series term itself was zero in the limit.\u00a0 This will always be true for convergent series and leads to the following theorem....\u00a0...If ...converges then .......\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, we can   use these two partial sums to write,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now because we   know that ...\u00a0is convergent we also know that the sequence   ...\u00a0is also convergent and that ...for some finite value ....\u00a0   However, since ...\u00a0as ...\u00a0we also have .......\u00a0...We now have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Be careful to not misuse this theorem!\u00a0 This theorem gives us a requirement for convergence but not a guarantee of convergence.\u00a0 In other words, the converse is NOT true.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0the series may actually diverge!\u00a0 Consider the following two series....\u00a0...In both cases the series terms are zero in the limit as ... goes to infinity, yet only the second series converges.\u00a0 The first series diverges.\u00a0 It will be a couple of sections before we can prove this, so at this point please believe this and know that you\u2019ll be able to prove the convergence of these two series in a couple of sections....\u00a0...Again, as noted above, all this theorem does is give us a requirement for a series to converge.\u00a0 In order for a series to converge the series terms must go to zero in the limit.\u00a0 If the series terms do not go to zero in the limit then there is no way the series can converge since this would violate the theorem....\u00a0...This leads us to the first of many tests for the convergence/divergence of a series that we\u2019ll be seeing in this chapter....\u00a0...\u00a0...If ...\u00a0then ...will diverge....\u00a0...Again, do NOT misuse this test.\u00a0 This test only says that a series is guaranteed to diverge if the series terms don\u2019t go to zero in the limit.\u00a0 If the series terms do happen to go to zero the series may or may not converge!\u00a0\u00a0 Again, recall the following two series,...\u00a0...One of the more common mistakes that students make when they first get into series is to assume that if ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0will converge.\u00a0 There is just no way to guarantee this so be careful!...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example of how this test can be used....\u00a0...Determine   if the following series is convergent or divergent....With almost every series we\u2019ll be looking at in this   chapter the first thing that we should do is take a look at the series terms   and see if they go to zero or not.\u00a0 If   it\u2019s clear that the terms don\u2019t go to zero use the Divergence Test and be   done with the problem....\u00a0...That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do here....\u00a0...The limit of the series terms isn\u2019t zero and so by the   Divergence Test the series diverges....\u00a0...The divergence test is the first test of many tests that we will be looking at over the course of the next several sections.\u00a0 You will need to keep track of all these tests, the conditions under which they can be used and their conclusions all in one place so you can quickly refer back to them as you need to....\u00a0...Next we should briefly revisit arithmetic of series and convergence/divergence.\u00a0 As we saw in the previous section if ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are both convergent series then so are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Furthermore, these series will have the following sums or values....\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ll see an example of this in the next section after we get a few more examples under our belt.\u00a0 At this point just remember that a sum of convergent series is convergent and multiplying a convergent series by a number will not change its convergence....\u00a0...We need to be a little careful with these facts when it comes to divergent series.\u00a0 In the first case if ...\u00a0is divergent then ...\u00a0will also be divergent (provided ... isn\u2019t zero of course) since multiplying a series that is infinite in value or doesn\u2019t have a value by a finite value (...) won\u2019t change the fact that the series has an infinite or no value.\u00a0 However, it is possible to have both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0be divergent series and yet have ...\u00a0be a convergent series....\u00a0...Now, since the main topic of this section is the convergence of a series we should mention a stronger type of convergence.\u00a0 A series ...\u00a0is said to ... if ...\u00a0also converges.\u00a0 Absolute convergence is ... than convergence in the sense that a series that is absolutely convergent will also be convergent, but a series that is convergent may or may not be absolutely convergent....\u00a0...In fact if ...converges and ...\u00a0diverges the series ...is called .... ...\u00a0...At this point we don\u2019t really have the tools at hand to properly investigate this topic in detail nor do we have the tools in hand to determine if a series is absolutely convergent or not.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll not say anything more about this subject for a while.\u00a0 When we finally have the tools in hand to discuss this topic in more detail we will revisit it.\u00a0 Until then don\u2019t worry about it.\u00a0 The idea is mentioned here only because we were already discussing convergence in this section and it ties into the last topic that we want to discuss in this section....\u00a0...In the previous section after we\u2019d introduced the idea of an infinite series we commented on the fact that we shouldn\u2019t think of an infinite series as an infinite sum despite the fact that the notation we use for infinite series seems to imply that it is an infinite sum.\u00a0 It\u2019s now time to briefly discuss this....\u00a0...First, we need to introduce the idea of a .... A rearrangement of a series is exactly what it might sound like, it is the same series with the terms rearranged into a different order....\u00a0...For example, consider the following infinite series....\u00a0...A rearrangement of this series is,...\u00a0...The issue we need to discuss here is that for some series each of these arrangements of terms can have different values despite the fact that they are using exactly the same terms....\u00a0...Here is an example of this.\u00a0 It can be shown that,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Since this series converges we know that if we multiply it by a constant ... its value will also be multiplied by ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s multiply this by ...\u00a0to get, ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s add in a zero between each term as follows....\u00a0...Note that this won\u2019t change the value of the series because the partial sums for this series will be the partial sums for the ... except that each term will be repeated.\u00a0 Repeating terms in a series will not affect its limit however and so both ... and ... will be the same....\u00a0...We know that if two series converge we can add them by adding term by term and so add ... and ... to get,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, notice that the terms of ... are simply the terms of ... rearranged so that each negative term comes after two positive terms.\u00a0 The values however are definitely different despite the fact that the terms are the same.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note as well that this is not one of those \u201ctricks\u201d that you see occasionally where you get a contradictory result because of a hard to spot math/logic error.\u00a0 This is a very real result and we\u2019ve not made any logic mistakes/errors....\u00a0...Here is a nice set of facts that govern this idea of when a rearrangement will lead to a different value of a series....\u00a0...Given the series ...,...\u00a0...Again, we do not have the tools in hand yet to determine if a series is absolutely convergent and so don\u2019t worry about this at this point.\u00a0 This is here just to make sure that you understand that we have to be very careful in thinking of an infinite series as an infinite sum.\u00a0 There are times when we can (... the series is absolutely convergent) and there are times when we can\u2019t (... the series is conditionally convergent)....\u00a0...As a final note, the fact above tells us that the series,...must be conditionally convergent since two rearrangements gave two separate values of this series.\u00a0 Eventually it will be very simple to show that this series is conditionally convergent.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/ConvergenceOfSeries.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus II - Series - Convergence/Divergence", "subject": "math"}},

(or sometimes the ...) of the sequence and write,...\u00a0...This notation should look familiar to you.\u00a0 It is the same notation we used when we talked about the limit of a function.\u00a0 In fact, if you recall, we said earlier that we could think of sequences as functions in some way and so this notation shouldn\u2019t be too surprising....\u00a0...Using the ideas that we developed for limits of functions we can write down the following ... for limits of sequences....\u00a0...if we can make ... as close to ... as we want for all sufficiently   large ....\u00a0 In other words, the value of the ...\u2019s approach ... as ... approaches infinity....   ...   ...if we can make ... as large as we want for   all sufficiently large ....\u00a0 Again, in other words, the value of the ...\u2019s get larger and larger   without bound as ... approaches   infinity....   ...   ...if we can make ... as large and negative as   we want for all sufficiently large ....\u00a0 Again, in other words, the value of the ...\u2019s are negative and get   larger and larger without bound as ...   approaches infinity....\u00a0...The working definitions of the various sequence limits are nice in that they help us to visualize what the limit actually is.\u00a0 Just like with limits of functions however, there is also a precise definition for each of these limits.\u00a0 Let\u2019s give those before proceeding...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

definitions tell us that in order for a limit to exist and have a finite value all the sequence terms must be getting closer and closer to that finite value as ... increases....\u00a0...Now that we have the definitions of the limit of sequences out of the way we have a bit of terminology that we need to look at.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0exists and is finite we say that the sequence is ....\u00a0 If ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist or is infinite we say the sequence ....\u00a0 Note that sometimes we will say the sequence ...\u00a0if ...\u00a0and if ...\u00a0we will sometimes say that the sequence .......\u00a0...Get used to the terms \u201cconvergent\u201d and \u201cdivergent\u201d as we\u2019ll be seeing them quite a bit throughout this chapter....\u00a0...So just how do we find the limits of sequences?\u00a0 Most limits of most sequences can be found using one of the following theorems....\u00a0...Given the sequence ...\u00a0if we have a function ...\u00a0such that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0...This theorem is basically telling us that we take the limits of sequences much like we take the limit of functions.\u00a0 In fact, in most cases we\u2019ll not even really use this theorem by explicitly writing down a function.\u00a0 We will more often just treat the limit as if it were a limit of a function and take the limit as we always did back in Calculus I when we were taking the limits of functions....\u00a0...So, now that we know that taking the limit of a sequence is nearly identical to taking the limit of a function we also know that all the properties from the limits of functions will also hold....\u00a0...\u00a0...These properties can be proved using Theorem 1 above and the ... we saw in Calculus I or we can prove them directly using the precise definition of a limit using nearly identical ... of the function limit properties....\u00a0...Next, just as we had a Squeeze Theorem for function limits we also have one for sequences and it is pretty much identical to the function limit version....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0for all ...\u00a0for some ...   and ...\u00a0then ....   ...\u00a0...Note that in this theorem the \u201cfor all ...\u00a0for some ...\u201d is really just telling us that\u00a0 we need to have ...\u00a0for all sufficiently large ..., but if it isn\u2019t true for the first few ... that won\u2019t invalidate the theorem....\u00a0...As we\u2019ll see not all sequences can be written as functions that we can actually take the limit of.\u00a0 This will be especially true for sequences that alternate in signs.\u00a0 While we can always write these sequence terms as a function we simply don\u2019t know how to take the limit of a function like that.\u00a0 The following theorem will help with some of these sequences....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0then .......\u00a0...Note that in order for this theorem to hold the limit MUST be zero and it won\u2019t work for a sequence whose limit is not zero.\u00a0 This theorem is easy enough to prove so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

do is recall the method that   was developed in Calculus I to deal with the limits of rational   functions.\u00a0 See the ... section   of my Calculus I notes for a review of this if you need to.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To do a limit in this form all we need to do is factor   from the numerator and denominator the largest power of ..., cancel and then take the limit....\u00a0...So the sequence converges and its limit is .......\u00a0... ...\u00a0...We will need to be careful with this one.\u00a0\u00a0 We will need to use L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule on   this sequence.\u00a0 The problem is that   L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule only works on functions and not on sequences.\u00a0 Normally this would be a problem, but we\u2019ve   got Theorem 1 from above to help us out.\u00a0   Let\u2019s define...and note that,...\u00a0...Theorem 1 says that all we need to do is take the limit of   the function....So, the sequence in this part diverges (to ...)....\u00a0...More often than not we just do L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule on the   sequence terms without first converting to ...\u2019s since the work will be identical regardless of whether we use   ... or ....\u00a0 However, we really   should remember that technically we can\u2019t do the derivatives while dealing   with sequence terms....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...We will also need to be careful with this sequence.\u00a0 We might be tempted to just say that the   limit of the sequence terms is zero (and we\u2019d be correct).\u00a0 However, technically we can\u2019t take the   limit of sequences whose terms alternate in sign, because we don\u2019t know how   to do limits of functions that exhibit that same behavior.\u00a0 Also, we want to be very careful to not   rely too much on intuition with these problems.\u00a0 As we will see in the next section, and in   later sections, our intuition can lead us astray in these problem if we   aren\u2019t careful....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s work this one by the book.\u00a0 We will need to use Theorem 2 on this   problem.\u00a0 To this we\u2019ll first need to   compute,...\u00a0...Therefore, since the limit of the sequence terms with   absolute value bars on them goes to zero we know by Theorem 2 that,...which also means that the sequence converges to a value of   zero....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...For this theorem note that all we need to do is realize   that this is the sequence in Theorem 3 above using ....\u00a0 So, by Theorem 3 this sequence diverges....\u00a0...We now need to give a warning about misusing Theorem 2.\u00a0 Theorem 2 only works if the limit is zero.\u00a0 If the limit of the absolute value of the sequence terms is not zero then the theorem will not hold.\u00a0 The last part of the previous example is a good example of this (and in fact this warning is the whole reason that part is there).\u00a0 Notice that ...\u00a0and yet, ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t even exist let alone equal 1.\u00a0 So, be careful using this Theorem 2.\u00a0 You must always remember that it only works if the limit is zero....\u00a0...Before moving onto the next section we need to give one more theorem that we\u2019ll need for a proof down the road....\u00a0...For the sequence ...\u00a0if both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is convergent and

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Up to this point we\u2019ve dealt exclusively with the Cartesian (or Rectangular, or ...) coordinate system.\u00a0 However, as we will see, this is not always the easiest coordinate system to work in.\u00a0 So, in this section we will start looking at the polar coordinate system....\u00a0...Coordinate systems are really nothing more than a way to define a point in space.\u00a0 For instance in the Cartesian coordinate system at point is given the coordinates (...) and we use this to define the point by starting at the origin and then moving ... units horizontally followed by ... units vertically.\u00a0 This is shown in the sketch below....\u00a0...This is not, however, the only way to define a point in two dimensional space.\u00a0 Instead of moving vertically and horizontally from the origin to get to the point we could instead go straight out of the origin until we hit the point and then determine the angle this line makes with the positive ...-axis.\u00a0 We could then use the distance of the point from the origin and the amount we needed to rotate from the positive ...-axis as the coordinates of the point.\u00a0 This is shown in the sketch below....\u00a0...Coordinates in this form are called ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The above discussion may lead one to think that ... must be a positive number.\u00a0 However, we also allow ... to be negative.\u00a0 Below is a sketch of the two points ...\u00a0and .......From this sketch we can see that if ... is positive the point will be in the same quadrant as ....\u00a0 On the other hand if ... is negative the point will end up in the quadrant exactly opposite ....\u00a0 Notice as well that the coordinates ...\u00a0describe the same point as the coordinates ...\u00a0do.\u00a0 The coordinates ...\u00a0tells us to rotate an angle of ...\u00a0from the positive ...-axis, this would put us on the dashed line in the sketch above, and then move out a distance of 2....\u00a0...This leads to an important difference between Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates.\u00a0 In Cartesian coordinates there is exactly one set of coordinates for any given point.\u00a0 With polar coordinates this isn\u2019t true.\u00a0 In polar coordinates there is literally an infinite number of coordinates for a given point.\u00a0 For instance, the following four points are all coordinates for the same point....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the angles used in these four sets of coordinates....In the second coordinate pair we rotated in a clock-wise direction to get to the point.\u00a0 We shouldn\u2019t forget about rotating in the clock-wise direction.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s what we have to do....\u00a0...The last two coordinate pairs use the fact that if we end up in the opposite quadrant from the point we can use a negative ... to get back to the point and of course there is both a counter clock-wise and a clock-wise rotation to get to the angle....\u00a0...These four points only represent the coordinates of the point without rotating around the system more than once.\u00a0 If we allow the angle to make as many complete rotations about the axis system as we want then there are an infinite number of coordinates for the same point.\u00a0 In fact the point ...\u00a0can be represented by any of the following coordinate pairs....\u00a0...Next we should talk about the origin of the coordinate system.\u00a0 In polar coordinates the origin is often called the ....\u00a0 Because we aren\u2019t actually moving away from the origin/pole we know that ....\u00a0 However, we can still rotate around the system by any angle we want and so the coordinates of the origin/pole are .......\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve got a grasp on polar coordinates we need to think about converting between the two coordinate systems.\u00a0 Well start out with the following sketch reminding us how both coordinate systems work....Note that we\u2019ve got a right triangle above and with that we can get the following equations that will convert\u00a0 polar coordinates into Cartesian coordinates....\u00a0...\u00a0...Converting from Cartesian is almost as easy.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first notice the following....\u00a0...This is a very useful formula that we should remember, however we are after an equation for ... so let\u2019s take the square root of both sides.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...Note that technically we should have a plus or minus in front of the root since we know that ... can be either positive or negative.\u00a0 We will run with the convention of positive ... here....\u00a0...Getting an equation for ...\u00a0is almost as simple.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with,...\u00a0...Taking the inverse tangent of both sides gives,...\u00a0...We will need to be careful with this because inverse tangents only return values in the range ....\u00a0 Recall that there is a second possible angle and that the second angle is given by .......\u00a0...Summarizing then gives the following formulas for converting from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a quick example....\u00a0...Convert   each of the following points into the given coordinate system....\u00a0into Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0\u00a0 ...(-1,-1)   into polar coordinates.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...\u00a0...This conversion is easy enough.\u00a0 All we need to do is plug the points into   the formulas....So, in Cartesian coordinates this point is .......\u00a0...\u00a0... ... (-1,-1) ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s first get .......Now, let\u2019s get .......This is not the correct angle however.\u00a0 This value of ...\u00a0is in the first quadrant and the point we\u2019ve   been given is in the third quadrant.\u00a0   As noted above we can get the correct angle by adding ...\u00a0onto this.\u00a0   Therefore, the actual angle is,...\u00a0...So, in polar coordinates the point is ....\u00a0 Note as well that we could have used the   first ...\u00a0that we got by using a negative ....\u00a0   In this case the point could also be written in polar coordinates as .......\u00a0...We can also use the above formulas to convert equations from one coordinate system to the other....\u00a0...Convert   each of the following into an equation in the given coordinate system....Convert   ...\u00a0into polar coordinates.\u00a0\u00a0 ...Convert   ...\u00a0into Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...\u00a0...In this case there really isn\u2019t much to do other than   plugging in the formulas for ... and ... (...   the Cartesian coordinates) in terms of ...   and ...\u00a0(...   the polar coordinates).... ...\u00a0...This one is a little trickier, but not by much.\u00a0 First notice that we could substitute   straight for the ....\u00a0 However, there is no straight substitution   for the cosine that will give us only Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0 If we had an ... on the right along with the cosine then we could do a direct   substitution. So, if an ... on the   right side would be convenient let\u2019s put one there, just don\u2019t forget to put one on the left side as well....\u00a0...We can now make some substitutions that will convert this   into Cartesian coordinates....\u00a0...\u00a0...Before moving on to the next subject let\u2019s do a little more work on the second part of the previous example....\u00a0...The equation given in the second part is actually a fairly well known graph; it just isn\u2019t in a form that most people will quickly recognize.\u00a0 To identify it let\u2019s take the Cartesian coordinate equation and do a little rearranging....\u00a0...Now, complete the square on the ... portion of the equation....\u00a0...So, this was a circle of radius 4 and center (-4,0)....\u00a0...This leads us into the final topic of this section....\u00a0...Let\u2019s identify a few of the more common graphs in polar coordinates.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also take a look at a couple of special polar graphs....\u00a0...Some lines have fairly simple equations in polar coordinates....\u00a0...This is a line that goes through the origin and makes an angle of\u00a0 ...\u00a0with the positive ...-axis.\u00a0 Or, in other words it is a line through the origin with slope of ....... ... ...\u00a0...Graph   ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0on the same axis system....There really isn\u2019t too much to this one other than doing   the graph so here it is....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at the equations of circles in polar coordinates....\u00a0...Graph   ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0on the same axis system....\u00a0...The first one is a circle of radius 7 centered at the   origin.\u00a0 The second is a circle of   radius 2 centered at (2,0).\u00a0 The third   is a circle of radius ...\u00a0centered at ....\u00a0 Here is the graph of the three equations....\u00a0...Note that it takes a range of ...\u00a0for a complete graph of ...\u00a0and it only takes a range of ...\u00a0to graph the other circles given here....\u00a0...These can be broken up into the following three cases....\u00a0...\u00a0...Graph   ...,   ...,   and .......These will all graph out once in the range ....\u00a0 Here is a table of values for each followed   by graphs of each....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...0...5...1...6...0...7...2...5...13...-2...10...7...2...5...1...6...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...There is one final thing that we need to do in this section.\u00a0 In the third graph in the previous example we had an inner loop.\u00a0 We will, on occasion, need to know the value of ...\u00a0\u00a0for which the graph will pass through the origin.\u00a0 To find these all we need to do is set the equation equal to zero and solve as follows,...\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/PolarCoordinates.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus II - Polar Coordinates", "subject": "math"}},

find the derivative   so we can get the slope of the tangent line....\u00a0...At this point we\u2019ve got a small problem.\u00a0 The derivative is in terms of ... and all we\u2019ve got is an ... coordinate pair.\u00a0 The next step then is to determine the value(s)   of ... which will give this   point.\u00a0 We find these by plugging the ... and ... values into the parametric equations and solving for .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Any value of ...   which appears in both lists will give the point.\u00a0 So, since there are two values of ... that give the point we will in fact   get two

tangents lines at a point.\u00a0 This was definitely not possible back in Calculus I where we first ran across tangent lines....\u00a0...A quick graph of the parametric curve will explain what is going on here....\u00a0...So, the parametric curve crosses itself!\u00a0 That explains how there can be more than one tangent line.\u00a0 There is one tangent line for each instance that the curve goes through the point....\u00a0...The next topic that we need to discuss in this section is that of horizontal and vertical tangents.\u00a0 We can easily identify where these will occur (or at least the ...\u2019s that will give them) by looking at the derivative formula....\u00a0...Horizontal tangents will occur where the derivative is zero and that means that we\u2019ll get horizontal tangent at values of ... for which we have,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Vertical tangents will occur where the derivative is not defined and so we\u2019ll get vertical tangents at values of ... for which we

which gives the horizontal tangents and we were asked to find   the ... coordinates of the   point.\u00a0 To get these we just need to   plug ... into the parametric   equations.\u00a0 Therefore, the only   horizontal tangent will occur at the point (0,-9)....\u00a0...In this case we need to solve,...\u00a0...The two vertical tangents will occur at the points (2,-6)   and (-2,-6)....\u00a0...For the sake of completeness and at least partial   verification here is the sketch of the parametric curve....\u00a0...The final topic that we need to discuss in this section really isn\u2019t related to tangent lines, but does fit in nicely with the derivation of the derivative that we needed to get the slope of the tangent line....\u00a0...Before moving into the new topic let\u2019s first remind ourselves of the formula for the first derivative and in the process rewrite it slightly....\u00a0...\u00a0...Written in this way we can see that the formula actually tells us how to differentiate a

some ...\u2019s....\u00a0...-2...2...-5...-1...0...-3...-2...0...0...-1...1...2...1...\u00a0...The first question that should be asked at this point is,   how did we know to use the values of ...

of   what the curve looks like.\u00a0 It is this   problem with picking \u201cgood\u201d values of ...   that make this method of sketching parametric curves one of the poorer   choices.\u00a0 Sometimes we have no choice,   but if we do have a choice we should avoid it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll discuss an alternate graphing method   in later examples....\u00a0...We have one more idea to discuss before we actually sketch   the curve.\u00a0 Parametric curves have a ....\u00a0 The direction of motion is given by   increasing ....\u00a0 So, when plotting parametric curves we also   include arrows that show the direction of motion.\u00a0 We will often give the value of ... that gave specific points on the   graph as well to make it clear the value of ... that gave that particular point....\u00a0...Here is the sketch of this parametric curve....\u00a0...So, it looks like we have a parabola that opens to the   right.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before we end this example there is a somewhat important   and subtle point that we need to discuss first.\u00a0 Notice that we made sure to include a   portion of the sketch to the right of the points corresponding to ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0to indicate that there are portions of the   sketch there.\u00a0 Had we simply stopped   the sketch at those points we are indicating that there was no portion of the   curve to the right of those points and there clearly will be.\u00a0 We just didn\u2019t compute any of those points....\u00a0...This may seem like an unimportant point, but as we\u2019ll see   in the next example it\u2019s more important than we might think at this point....\u00a0...Before addressing a much easier way to sketch this graph let\u2019s first address the issue of limits on the parameter.\u00a0 In the previous example we didn\u2019t have any limits on the parameter.\u00a0 Without limit on the parameter the graph will continue in both directions as shown in the sketch above. ...\u00a0...We will often have limits on the parameter however and this will affect the sketch of the parametric equations.\u00a0 To see this effect let\u2019s look a slight variation of the previous example....\u00a0...Sketch   the parametric curve for the following set of parametric equations....Note that the only difference here is the presence of the   limits on ....\u00a0 All these limits do is tell us that we can\u2019t take   any value of ... outside of this range.\u00a0 Therefore, the parametric   curve will only be a portion of the curve above.\u00a0 Here is the parametric   curve for this example....\u00a0...Notice that with this sketch we started and stopped the   sketch right on the points originating from the end points of the range of ...\u2019s.\u00a0   Contrast this with the sketch in the previous example where we had a   portion of the sketch to the right of the \u201cstart\u201d and \u201cend\u201d points that we   computed. ...\u00a0...In this case the curve starts at ...\u00a0and ends at ...,   whereas in the previous example the curve didn\u2019t really start at the right   most points that we computed.\u00a0 We need   to be clear in our sketches if the curve starts/ends right at a point, or if   that point was simply the first/last one that we computed....\u00a0...It is now time to take a look at an easier method of sketching this parametric curve.\u00a0 This method uses the fact that in many, but not all, cases we can actually eliminate the parameter from the parametric equations and get a function involving only ... and ....\u00a0 There will be two small problems with this method, but it will be easy to address those problems.\u00a0 It is important to note however that we won\u2019t always be able to do this....\u00a0...Just how we eliminate the parameter will depend upon the parametric equations that we\u2019ve got.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see how to eliminate the parameter for the set of parametric equations that we\u2019ve been working with to this point....\u00a0...\u00a0...Eliminate   the parameter from the following set of parametric equations....One of the easiest ways to eliminate the parameter is to   simply solve one of the equations for the parameter (..., in this case) and substitute that into the other   equation.\u00a0 Note that while this may be the easiest to eliminate the   parameter, it\u2019s usually not the best way as we\u2019ll see soon enough....\u00a0...In this case we can easily solve ... for .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Plugging this   into the equation for ... gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Sure enough from our Algebra knowledge we can see that   this is a parabola that opens to the right....\u00a0...We won\u2019t bother with a sketch for this one as we\u2019ve already   sketched this once and the point here was more to eliminate the parameter   anyway....\u00a0...Getting a sketch of the parametric curve once we\u2019ve eliminated the parameter is fairly simple.\u00a0 All we need to do is graph the equation that we found by eliminating the parameter.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As noted already however, there are two small problems with this method.\u00a0 The first is direction of motion.\u00a0 The equation involving only ... and ... will NOT give the direction of motion of the parametric curve.\u00a0 This is an easy problem to fix however.\u00a0 All we need to do is plug in some values of ... into the parametric equations and we can determine direction of motion from that.\u00a0 How many values of ... we plug in will depend upon the parametric equations.\u00a0 In some cases only two will be required and in others we might need more points....\u00a0...The second problem is best illustrated in an example as we\u2019ll be running into this problem in the remaining examples....\u00a0...Sketch   the parametric curve for the following set of parametric equations.\u00a0   Clearly indicate direction of motion....In this case we could eliminate the parameter as we did in   the previous section by solving one of these for ... and plugging this   into the other.\u00a0 For example,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Can you see the problem with doing this?\u00a0 This is   definitely easy to do but we have a greater chance of correctly graphing the   original parametric equations than we do graphing this!...\u00a0...There are many ways to eliminate the parameter from the   parametric equations and solving for ... is usually not the best way to   do it.\u00a0 While it is often easy to do we will, in most cases, end up with   an equation that is almost impossible to deal with....\u00a0...So, how can we eliminate the parameter here?\u00a0 In this case all we need to do is recall a   very nice trig identity and the equation of an ellipse.\u00a0 Let\u2019s notice that we could do the following   here....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Eliminating the   middle steps gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and so it looks like we\u2019ve got an ellipse. ...\u00a0...Before proceeding with this example it should be noted   that what we did was probably not all that obvious to most.\u00a0 However, once it\u2019s been done it does   clearly work and so it\u2019s a nice idea that we can use to eliminate the   parameter from some parametric equations involving sines and cosines.\u00a0 It won\u2019t always work and sometimes it will   take a lot more manipulation of things than we did here....\u00a0...An alternate method that we could have used here was to   solve the two parametric equations for sine and cosine as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Then, recall   the trig identity we used above and these new equation we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the same   answer as the other method.\u00a0 Which   method you use will probably depend on which you find easier to use.\u00a0 Both are perfectly valid and will get the   same result....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s continue on with the example.\u00a0 We\u2019ve identified that the parametric   equations describe an ellipse, but we can\u2019t just sketch an ellipse and be   done with it.\u00a0 Recall that all   parametric curves have a direction of motion.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we next need to determine the direction of   motion.\u00a0 The equation of the ellipse   tells us nothing about the direction of motion.\u00a0 To get the direction of motion we\u2019ll need   to go back to the parametric equations and plug in a few points.\u00a0 Note as well that in this case we\u2019ll need   more than two points to do this.\u00a0 Given any two points on an ellipse we   could get between them by going either clockwise or counter-clockwise about   the circle.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll need at least three points to accurately   determine the direction of motion....\u00a0...While doing this we should also keep in mind that we\u2019ve   been given a range of ...\u2019s to work with and as we saw in Example 2 this   may mean that we will only get a portion of the actual ellipse.\u00a0 So,   let\u2019s choose ...\u2019s that will cover the whole range.\u00a0 This will give   us the direction of motion and enough information to determine what portion   of the ellipse is in fact traced out....\u00a0...Note that this is the second problem alluded to above in   eliminating the parameter.\u00a0 Once we have eliminated the parameter we\u2019ve   not only eliminated the direction of motion, but we\u2019ve also eliminated any   information about what portion of the actual graph is traced out by the   parametric equations.\u00a0 We will always need to keep in mind that this a   potential problem when eliminating the parameter from parametric equations....\u00a0...So, here is a table of values for this set of parametric   equations....\u00a0...0...5...0...0...2...-5...0...0...-2...5...0...\u00a0...It looks like we are moving in a counter-clockwise   direction about the ellipse and it also looks like we\u2019ll make exactly one   complete trace of the ellipse in the range given....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the parametric curve....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example....\u00a0...Sketch   the parametric curve for the following set of parametric equations.\u00a0   Clearly indicate direction of motion....Note that the only difference in these parametric   equations is that we replaced the ... with 3....\u00a0 We can   eliminate the parameter here using either of the methods we discussed in the   previous example.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll   do the following,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...\u00a0...So, we get the   same ellipse that we did in the previous example.\u00a0 However, we also   don\u2019t get the same parametric curve in some sense.\u00a0 We saw in the   previous example that we make one complete trace of the ellipse in the range ....\u00a0 In this set of parametric curves we don\u2019t   have just a ... in the trig functions however.\u00a0 In this set we\u2019ve   got a 3.......\u00a0...When we have a ... we know that we\u2019ll complete a single   trace when ...\u00a0so to determine a ... that will complete a single trace when we have a 3... all we need to do is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, while we   have the same ellipse that we got in the previous example we\u2019ll trace out the   curve exactly once in the range,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Since we are   working on the range ...\u00a0it then looks like the ellipse in this case   will be traced out three times instead of only once as we got in the previous   example.\u00a0 Each ellipse will be traced   out in the following ranges,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The last issue   we need to deal with prior to sketching is the direction of motion.\u00a0 By   picking values of ... we can see that the direction of motion isn\u2019t   changed in this case.\u00a0 However, because we\u2019re going around faster than   before we should probably use a different set this time to make sure we get   an accurate idea of the direction of motion....\u00a0...0...5...0...0...2...-5...0...\u00a0...Here\u2019s the sketch and note that it really isn\u2019t all that   different from the previous sketch.\u00a0   The only differences are the value of ... and the various points we included....\u00a0...So, we saw in the last two examples two sets of parametric equations that in some way gave the same graph.\u00a0 Yet, because they traced out the graph a different number of times we really do need to think of them as different parametric curves.\u00a0 This may seem like a difference that we don\u2019t need to worry about, but as we will see in later sections this can be a very important difference.\u00a0 In some of the later sections we are going to need a curve that is traced out exactly once....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple more examples....\u00a0...Sketch   the parametric curve for the following set of parametric equations.\u00a0 Clearly identify the direction of   motion.\u00a0 If the curve is traced out   more than once give a range of the parameter for which the curve will trace   out exactly once....We can eliminate the parameter much as we did in the   previous two examples.\u00a0 However, we\u2019ll   need to note that the ... already   contains a ...\u00a0and so we won\u2019t need to square the ....\u00a0   We will however, need to square the ... as we need in the previous two examples....In this case we get a parabola that opens to the   left.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will need to be very, very careful however in sketching   this parametric curve.\u00a0 We will NOT get   the whole parabola.\u00a0 A sketch of a   parabola, in this form, will exist for all possible values of ....\u00a0   However, we have defined both ...   and ... in terms of sine and cosine   and we know that the value of these are limited and so we won\u2019t get all   possible values of ... and ... here.\u00a0 To see what values of ... and ... we get let\u2019s   note the following,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it is clear from this that we will only get the   portion of the parabola that is defined by the equation above.\u00a0 Before sketching let\u2019s also get the   direction of motion.\u00a0 Here are some   points for a range of ...\u2019s....0...0...2...1...0...0...-2...1...0...0...2...\u00a0...In the range ...\u00a0we start at (0,2) and end up back at that   same point.\u00a0 Recalling that we must   travel along the parabola this means that we must retrace our path to get   back to the starting point.\u00a0 So, it   looks like we\u2019ve got a parametric curve that is traced out over and over in   both directions and we will trace out once in the range .......\u00a0...\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve seen examples that would trace out the complete graph that we got by eliminating the parameter if we took a large enough range of ...\u2019s.\u00a0 However, in the previous example we\u2019ve now seen that this will not always be the case.\u00a0 It is more than possible to have a set of parametric equations which will continuously trace out just a portion of the curve.\u00a0 We can usually determine if this will happen by looking for limits on ... and ... that are imposed up us by the parametric equation....\u00a0...We will often use parametric equations to describe the path of an object or particle.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at an example of that....\u00a0...The   path of a particle is given by the following set of parametric equations....Completely describe the path of this particle.\u00a0 Do this by sketching the path, determining   limits on ... and ... and giving a range of ...\u2019s for which the path will be traced   out exactly once (provide it traces out more than once of course)....\u00a0...Eliminating the parameter this time will be a little   different.\u00a0 We only have cosines this   time and we\u2019ll use that to our advantage.\u00a0   We can solve the ... equation   for cosine and plug that into the equation for ....\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...This time we\u2019ve got a parabola that opens upward.\u00a0 We also have the following limits on ... and .......\u00a0...So, again we only trace out a portion of the curve.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a set of evaluations so we can   determine a range of ...\u2019s for one   trace of the curve....\u00a0...\u00a0...0...3...2...0...1...-3...2...0...1...3...2...\u00a0...So, it looks like the particle, again, will continuously   trace out this portion of the curve and will make one trace in the range ....\u00a0 Here is a sketch of the particle's path with   a few value of ... on it....\u00a0...We should give a small warning at this point.\u00a0 Because of the ideas involved in them we concentrated on parametric curves that retraced portions of the curve more than once.\u00a0 Do not, however, get too locked into the idea that this will always happen.\u00a0 Many, if not most parametric curves will only trace out once.\u00a0 The first one we looked at is a good example of this.\u00a0 That parametric curve will never repeat any portion of itself....\u00a0...There is one final topic to be discussed in this section before moving on.\u00a0 So far we\u2019ve started with parametric equations and eliminated the parameter to determine the parametric curve....\u00a0...However, there are times in which we want to go the other way.\u00a0 Given a function or equation we might want to write down a set of parametric equations for it.\u00a0 In these cases we say that we ... the function....\u00a0...If we take Examples 4 and 5 as examples we can do this for ellipses (and hence circles).\u00a0 Given the ellipse ...a set of parametric equations for it would be,...\u00a0...This set of parametric equations will trace out the ellipse starting at the point ...\u00a0and will trace in a counter-clockwise direction and will trace out exactly once in the range ....\u00a0 This is a fairly important set of parametric equations as it used continually in some subjects with dealing with ellipses and/or circles....\u00a0...Every curve can be parameterized in more than one way.\u00a0 Any of the following will also parameterize the same ellipse....\u00a0...The presence of the ...\u00a0will change the speed that the ellipse rotates as we saw in Example 5.\u00a0 Note as well that the last two will trace out ellipses with a clockwise direction of motion (you might want to verify this).\u00a0 Also note that they won\u2019t all start at the same place (if we think of ...\u00a0as the starting point that is)....\u00a0...There are many more parameterizations of an ellipse of course, but you get the idea.\u00a0 It is important to remember that each parameterization will trace out the curve once with a potentially different range of ...\u2019s.\u00a0 Each parameterization may rotate with different directions of motion and may start at different points.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...You may find that you need a parameterization of an ellipse that starts at a particular place and has a particular direction of motion and so you now know that with some work you can write down a set of parametric equations that will give you the behavior that you\u2019re after....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s write down a couple of other important parameterizations and all the comments about direction of motion, starting point, and range of ...\u2019s for one trace (if applicable) are still true....\u00a0...First, because a circle is nothing more than a special case of an ellipse we can use the parameterization of an ellipse to get the parametric equations for a circle centered at the origin of radius ... as well.\u00a0 One possible way to parameterize a circle is,...\u00a0...Finally, even though there may not seem to be any reason to, we can also parameterize functions in the form ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 In these cases we parameterize them in the following way,...\u00a0...At this point it may not seem all that useful to do a parameterization of a function like this, but there are many instances where it will actually be easier, or it may even be required, to work with the parameterization instead of the function itself.\u00a0 Unfortunately, almost all of these instances occur in a Calculus III course.", "url":

interval ...\u00a0there is a point ...\u00a0so that,...Therefore, the length can now be written as,...The exact length of the curve is then,...\u00a0...However, using the ..., this is nothing more than,...\u00a0...\u00a0...A slightly more convenient notation (in my opinion anyway) is the following....\u00a0...In a similar fashion we can also derive a formula for ...\u00a0on ....\u00a0 This formula is,...Again, the second form is probably a little more convenient. ...\u00a0...Note the difference in the derivative under the square root!\u00a0 Don\u2019t get too confused.\u00a0 With one we differentiate with respect to ... and with the other we differentiate with respect to ....\u00a0 One way to keep the two straight is to notice that the differential in the \u201cdenominator\u201d of the derivative will match up with the differential in the integral.\u00a0 This is one of the reasons why the second form is a little more convenient....\u00a0...Before we work any examples we need to make a small change in notation.\u00a0 Instead of having two formulas for the arc length of a function we are going to reduce it, in part, to a single formula....\u00a0...From this point on we are going to use the following formula for the length of the curve....where,...\u00a0...Note that no limits were put on the integral as the limits will depend upon the ... that we\u2019re using.\u00a0 Using the first ... will require ... limits of integration and using the second ... will require ... limits of integration....\u00a0...Thinking of the arc length formula as a single integral with different ways to define ... will be convenient when we run across arc lengths in future sections.\u00a0 Also, this ... notation will be a nice notation for the next section as well....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve derived the arc length formula let\u2019s work some examples....\u00a0...Determine   the length of ...\u00a0between .......In this case we\u2019ll need to use the first ... since the function is in the form ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s get the derivative out of the   way....\u00a0...Let\u2019s also get the root out of the way since there is   often simplification that can be done and there\u2019s no reason to do that inside   the integral....Note that we could drop the absolute value bars here since   secant is positive in the range given....\u00a0...The arc length is then,...\u00a0...Determine   the length of ...\u00a0between .......There is a very common mistake that students make in   problems of this type.\u00a0 Many students   see that the function is in the form ...\u00a0and they immediately decide that it will be   too difficult to work with it in that form so they solve for ... to get the function into the form ....\u00a0 While that can be done here it will lead to   a messier integral for us to deal with....\u00a0...Sometimes it\u2019s just easier to work with functions in the   form ....\u00a0 In fact, if you can work with functions in   the form ...\u00a0then you can work with functions in the form   ....\u00a0 There really isn\u2019t a difference between the   two so don\u2019t get excited about functions in the form .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s compute the derivative and the root....\u00a0...As you can see keeping the function in the form ...\u00a0is going to lead to a very easy   integral.\u00a0 To see what would happen if   we tried to work with the function in the form ...\u00a0see the next example....\u00a0...Let\u2019s get the length....\u00a0...As noted in the last example we really do have a choice as to which ... we use.\u00a0 Provided we can get the function in the form required for a particular ... we can use it.\u00a0 However, as also noted above, there will often be a significant difference in difficulty in the resulting integrals.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a quick look at what would happen in the previous example if we did put the function into the form ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Redo   the previous example using the function in the form ...\u00a0instead....In this case the function and its derivative would be,...\u00a0...The root in the arc length formula would then be....All the simplification work above was just to put the root   into a form that will allow us to do the integral....\u00a0...Now, before we write down the integral we\u2019ll also need to   determine the limits.\u00a0 This particular ... requires ... limits of integration and we\u2019ve got ... limits.\u00a0 They are easy   enough to get however.\u00a0 Since we know ... as a function of ... all we need to do is plug in the   original ... limits of integration   and get the ... limits of   integration.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...Not easy limits to deal with, but there they are....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now write down the integral that will give the   length....\u00a0...That\u2019s a really unpleasant looking integral.\u00a0 It can be evaluated however using the following   substitution....\u00a0...Using this substitution the integral becomes,...So, we got the same answer as in the previous   example.\u00a0 Although that shouldn\u2019t   really be all that surprising since we were dealing with the same curve....\u00a0...From a technical standpoint the integral in the previous example was not that difficult.\u00a0 It was just a Calculus I substitution.\u00a0 However, from a practical standpoint the integral was significantly more difficult than the integral we evaluated in Example 2.\u00a0 So, the moral of the story here is that we can use either formula (provided we can get the function in the correct form of course) however one will often be significantly easier to actually evaluate. ...\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s work one more example....\u00a0...Determine   the length of ...\u00a0for ....\u00a0 Assume that ... is positive....We\u2019ll use the second ...   for this one as the function is already in the correct form for that   one.\u00a0 Also, the other ... would again lead to a particularly   difficult integral.\u00a0 The derivative and   root will then be,...Before writing down the length notice that we were given ... limits and we will need ... limits for this ....\u00a0 With the assumption   that ... is positive these are easy   enough to get.\u00a0 All we need to do is   plug ... into our equation and solve   for ....\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The integral for the arc length is then,...This integral will require the following trig   substitution....The length is then,...\u00a0...The first couple of examples ended up being fairly simple Calculus I substitutions.\u00a0 However, as this last example had shown we can end up with trig substitutions as well for these integrals.", "url":

A perfect example is the following definite integral....\u00a0...We now need to talk a little bit about estimating values of definite integrals.\u00a0 We will look at three different methods, although one should already be familiar to you from your Calculus I days.\u00a0 We will develop all three methods for estimating...by thinking of the integral as an area problem and using known shapes to estimate the area under the curve....\u00a0...Let\u2019s get first develop the methods and then we\u2019ll try to estimate the integral shown above....\u00a0...This is the rule that should be somewhat familiar to you.\u00a0 We will divide the interval ...\u00a0into ... subintervals of equal width,...We will denote each of the intervals as follows,...\u00a0...Then for each interval let ...\u00a0be the midpoint of the interval.\u00a0 We then sketch in rectangles for each subinterval with a height of ....\u00a0 Here is a graph showing the set up using .......We can easily find the area for each of these rectangles and so for a general ... we get that,...Or, upon factoring out a ...we get the general Midpoint Rule....\u00a0...\u00a0...For this rule we will do the same set up as for the Midpoint Rule.\u00a0 We will break up the interval ...\u00a0into ... subintervals of width,...Then on each subinterval we will approximate the function with a straight line that is equal to the function values at either endpoint of the interval.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of this case for .......Each of these objects is a trapezoid (hence the rule's name\u2026) and as we can see some of them do a very good job of approximating the actual area under the curve and others don\u2019t do such a good job....\u00a0...The area of the trapezoid in the interval ...\u00a0is given by,...So, if we use

is,...\u00a0...In the Trapezoid Rule we approximated the curve with a straight line.\u00a0 For Simpson\u2019s Rule we are going to approximate the function with a quadratic and we\u2019re going to require that the quadratic agree with three of the points from our subintervals.\u00a0 Below is a sketch of this using ....\u00a0 Each of the approximations is colored differently so we can see how they actually work....Notice that each approximation actually covers two of the subintervals.\u00a0 This is the reason for requiring ... to be even.\u00a0 Some of the approximations look more like a line than a quadratic, but they really are quadratics.\u00a0 Also note that some of the approximations do a better job than others.\u00a0 It can be shown that the area under the approximation on the intervals ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is,...\u00a0...If we use ... subintervals the integral is then approximately,...\u00a0...Upon simplifying we arrive at the general Simpson\u2019s

(except for the first and last) are multiplied by 2.\u00a0 If you can remember this, this is a fairly easy rule to remember....\u00a0...Okay, it\u2019s time to work an example and see how these rules work....\u00a0...Using   ...\u00a0and all three rules to approximate the value   of the following integral....First, for reference purposes, Maple gives the following   value for this integral....\u00a0...In each case the width of the subintervals will be,...and so the subintervals will be,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s go through each of the methods....\u00a0...Remember that we evaluate at the midpoints of each of the   subintervals here!\u00a0 The Midpoint Rule   has an error of 1.96701523....\u00a0...The Trapezoid Rule has an error of 4.19193129...\u00a0...The Simpson\u2019s Rule has an error of 0.90099869....\u00a0...None of the estimations in the previous example are all that good.\u00a0 The best approximation in this case is from the Simpson\u2019s Rule and yet it still had an error of almost 1.\u00a0 To get a better estimation we would need to use a larger ....\u00a0 So, for completeness sake here are the estimates for some larger value of

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We\u2019ve now seen a fair number of different integration techniques and so we should probably pause at this point and talk a little bit about a strategy to use for determining the correct technique to use when faced with an integral....\u00a0...There are a couple of points that need to be made about this strategy.\u00a0 First, it isn\u2019t a hard and fast set of rules for determining the method that should be used.\u00a0 It is really nothing more than a general set of guidelines that will help us to identify techniques that may work.\u00a0 Some integrals can be done in more than one way and so depending on the path you take through the strategy you may end up with a different technique than somebody else who also went through this strategy....\u00a0...Second, while the strategy is presented as a way to identify the technique that could be used on an integral also keep in mind that, for many integrals, it can also automatically exclude certain techniques as well.\u00a0 When going through the strategy keep two lists in mind.\u00a0 The first list is integration techniques that simply won\u2019t work and the second list is techniques that look like they might work.\u00a0 After going through the strategy and the second list has only one entry then that is the technique to use.\u00a0 If, on the other hand, there is more than one possible technique to use we will then have to decide on which is liable to be the best for us to use.\u00a0 Unfortunately there is no way to teach which technique is the best as that usually depends upon the person and which technique they find to be the easiest....\u00a0...Third, don\u2019t forget that many integrals can be evaluated in multiple ways and so more than one technique may be used on it.\u00a0 This has already been mentioned in each of the previous points, but is important enough to warrant a separate mention.\u00a0 Sometimes one technique will be significantly easier than the others and so don\u2019t just stop at the first technique that appears to work.\u00a0 Always identify all possible techniques and then go back and determine which you feel will be the easiest for you to use....\u00a0...Next, it\u2019s entirely possible that you will need to use more than one method to completely do an integral.\u00a0 For instance a substitution may lead to using integration by parts or partial fractions integral....\u00a0...Finally, in my class I will accept any valid integration technique as a solution.\u00a0 As already noted there is often more than one way to do an integral and just because I find one technique to be the easiest doesn\u2019t mean that you will as well.\u00a0 So, in my class, there is no one right way of doing an integral.\u00a0 You may use any integration technique that I\u2019ve taught you in this class or you learned in Calculus I to evaluate integrals in this class.\u00a0 In other words, always take the approach that you find to be the easiest....\u00a0...Note that this final point is more geared towards my class and it\u2019s completely possible that your instructor may not agree with this and so be careful in applying this point if you aren\u2019t in my class....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s get on with the strategy.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...This integral can\u2019t be done as is, however simply by recalling the identity,...the integral becomes very easy to   do....\u00a0...Note that this example also shows   that simplification does not necessarily mean that we\u2019ll write the integrand   in a \u201csimpler\u201d form.\u00a0 It only means   that we\u2019ll write the integrand into a form that we can deal with and this is   often longer and/or \u201cmessier\u201d than the original integral....   ...   ...\u00a0...The first integral can be done   with partial fractions and the second could be done with a trig   substitution.\u00a0 ...   ...   However, both could also be evaluated using the substitution ...\u00a0and the work involved in the substitution   would be significantly less than the work involved in either partial   fractions or trig substitution....   ...   So, always look for quick, simple substitutions before moving on to the more   complicated Calculus II techniques....   ...   ...\u00a0...This integral doesn\u2019t obviously   fit into any of the forms we looked at in this chapter.\u00a0 However, with the substitution ...\u00a0we can reduce the integral to the form,...which is a trig substitution   problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...As noted above this strategy is not a hard and fast set of rules.\u00a0 It is only intended to guide you through the process of best determining how to do any given integral.\u00a0 Note as well that the only place Calculus II actually arises is in the third step.\u00a0 Steps 1, 2 and 4 involve nothing more than manipulation of the integrand either through direct manipulation of the integrand or by using a substitution.\u00a0 The last two steps are simply ideas to think about in going through this strategy....\u00a0...Many students go through this process and concentrate almost exclusively on Step 3 (after all this is Calculus II, so it\u2019s easy to see why they might do that\u2026.) to the exclusion of the other steps.\u00a0 One very large consequence of that exclusion is that often a simple manipulation or substitution is overlooked that could make the integral very easy to do.... ... Before moving on to the next section we should work a couple of quick problems illustrating a couple of not so obvious simplifications/manipulations and a not so obvious substitution....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....This integral almost falls into the form given in ....\u00a0   It is a quotient of tangent and secant and we know that sometimes we   can use the same methods for products of tangents and secants on   quotients.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The process from that ...   tells us that if we have even powers of secant to strip two of them off and   convert the rest to tangents.\u00a0 That   won\u2019t work here.\u00a0 We can split two   secants off, but they would be in the denominator and they won\u2019t do us any   good there. \u00a0Remember that the point of   splitting them off is so they would be there for the substitution ....\u00a0   That requires them to be in the numerator.\u00a0 So, that won\u2019t work and so we\u2019ll have to   find another solution method....\u00a0...There are in fact two solution methods to this integral   depending on how you want to go about it.\u00a0   We\u2019ll take a look at both....\u00a0...In this solution method we could just convert everything   to sines and cosines and see if that gives us an integral we can deal with. ...Note that just converting to sines and cosines won\u2019t   always work and if it does it won\u2019t always work this nicely.\u00a0 Often there will be a lot more work that   would need to be done to complete the integral....\u00a0...This solution method goes back to dealing with secants and   tangents.\u00a0 Let\u2019s notice that if we had   a secant in the numerator we could just use ...\u00a0as a substitution and it would be a fairly   quick and simple substitution to use.\u00a0   We don\u2019t have a secant in the numerator.\u00a0 However we could very easily get a secant   in the numerator simply by multiplying the numerator and denominator by   secant....\u00a0...In the previous example we saw two \u201csimplifications\u201d that allowed us to do the integral.\u00a0 The first was using identities to rewrite the integral into terms we could deal with and the second involved multiplying the numerator and the denominator by something to again put the integral into terms we could deal with....\u00a0...Using identities to rewrite an integral is an important \u201csimplification\u201d and we should not forget about it.\u00a0 Integrals can often be greatly simplified or at least put into a form that can be dealt with by using an identity....\u00a0...The second \u201csimplification\u201d is not used as often, but does show up on occasion so again, it\u2019s best to not forget about it.\u00a0 In fact, let\u2019s take another look at an example in which multiplying the numerator and denominator by something will allow us to do an integral....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....\u00a0...This is an integral in which if we just concentrate on the   third step we won\u2019t get anywhere.\u00a0 This   integral doesn\u2019t appear to be any of the kinds of integrals that we worked in   this chapter....\u00a0...We can do the integral however, if we do the following,...\u00a0...This does not appear to have done anything for us.\u00a0 However, if we now remember the first   \u201csimplification\u201d we looked at above we will notice that we can use an   identity to rewrite the denominator.\u00a0   Once we do that we can further reduce the integral into something we   can deal with....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve seen once again that multiplying the numerator and denominator by something can put the integral into a form that we can integrate.\u00a0 Notice as well that this example also showed that \u201csimplifications\u201d do not necessarily put an integral into a simpler form.\u00a0 They only put the integral into a form that is easier to integrate....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a quick look at an example of a substitution that is not so obvious....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....We introduced this example saying that the substitution   was not so obvious.\u00a0 However, this is   really an integral that falls into the form given by 3e in our strategy   above.\u00a0\u00a0 However, many people miss that   form and so don\u2019t think about it.\u00a0 So,   let\u2019s try the following substitution....\u00a0...With this substitution the integral becomes,...\u00a0...This is now an integration by parts integral.\u00a0 Remember that often we will need to use   more than one technique to completely do the integral.\u00a0 This is a fairly simple integration by   parts problem so I\u2019ll leave the remainder of the details to you to check....\u00a0...Before leaving this section we should also point out that there are integrals out there in the world that just can\u2019t be done in terms of functions that we know.\u00a0 Some examples of these are....\u00a0...That doesn\u2019t mean that these integrals can\u2019t be done at some level.\u00a0 If you go to a computer algebra system such as ... or ... and have it do these integrals it will return the following....\u00a0...So it appears that these integrals can in fact be done.\u00a0 However this is a little misleading.\u00a0 Here are the

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Now that we\u2019ve seen how to actually compute improper integrals we need to address one more topic about them.\u00a0 Often we aren\u2019t concerned with the actual value of these integrals.\u00a0 Instead we might only be interested in whether the integral is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 Also, there will be some integrals that we simply won\u2019t be able to integrate and yet we would still like to know if they converge or diverge.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To deal with this we\u2019ve got a test for convergence or divergence that we can use to help us answer the question of convergence for an improper integral....\u00a0...We will give this test only for a sub-case of the infinite interval integral, however versions of the test exist for the other sub-cases of the infinite interval integrals as well as integrals with discontinuous integrands....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0on the interval ...\u00a0then,...\u00a0...Note that if you think in terms of area the Comparison Test makes a lot of sense.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0is larger than ...\u00a0then the area under ...\u00a0must also be larger than the area under ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, if the area under the larger function is finite (... ...\u00a0converges) then the area under the smaller function must also be finite (... ...\u00a0converges).\u00a0 Likewise, if the area under the smaller function is infinite (... ...\u00a0diverges) then\u00a0 the area under the larger function must also be infinite (... ...\u00a0diverges)....\u00a0...Be careful not to misuse this test.\u00a0 If the smaller function converges there is no reason to believe that the larger will also converge (after all infinity is larger than a finite number\u2026) and if the larger function diverges there is no reason to believe that the smaller function will also diverge....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples using the comparison test.\u00a0 Note that all we\u2019ll be able to do is determine the convergence of the integral.\u00a0 We won\u2019t be able to determine the value of the integrals and so won\u2019t even bother with that....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent....Let\u2019s take a second and think about how the Comparison   Test works.\u00a0 If this integral is   convergent then we\u2019ll need to find a larger function that also converges on   the same interval.\u00a0 Likewise, if this   integral is divergent then we\u2019ll need to find a smaller function that also   diverges....\u00a0...So, it seems like it would be nice to have some idea as to   whether the integral converges or diverges ahead of time so we will know   whether we will need to look for a larger (and convergent) function or a   smaller (and divergent) function....\u00a0...To get the guess for this function let\u2019s notice that the   numerator is nice and bounded and simply won\u2019t get too large.\u00a0 Therefore, it seems likely that the   denominator will determine the convergence/divergence of this integral and we   know that...converges since ...\u00a0by the fact in the previous ....\u00a0 So let\u2019s guess that this integral will   converge....\u00a0...So we now know that we need to find a function that is   larger than ...and also converges.\u00a0   Making a fraction larger is actually a fairly simple process.\u00a0\u00a0 We can either make the numerator larger or   we can make the denominator smaller.\u00a0   In this case we can\u2019t do a lot about the denominator.\u00a0 However we can use the fact that ...\u00a0to make the numerator larger (... we\u2019ll replace the cosine with   something we know to be larger, namely 1).\u00a0   So,...Now, as we\u2019ve already noted ...converges and so by the Comparison Test we know that ...must also converge....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent....Let\u2019s first take a guess about the convergence of this   integral.\u00a0 As noted after the fact in   the last section about ...if the integrand goes to zero faster than ...\u00a0then the integral will probably converge. \u00a0Now, we\u2019ve got an exponential in the   denominator which is approaching infinity much faster than the ... and so it looks like this integral   should probably converge....\u00a0...So, we need a larger function that will also   converge.\u00a0 In this case we can\u2019t really   make the numerator larger and so we\u2019ll need to make the denominator smaller   in order to make the function larger as a whole.\u00a0 We will need to be careful however.\u00a0 There are two ways to do this and only one,   in this case only one, of them will work for us....\u00a0...First, notice that since the lower limit of integration is   3 we can say that ...\u00a0and we know that exponentials are always   positive.\u00a0 So, the denominator is the   sum of two positive terms and if we were to drop one of them the denominator   would get smaller.\u00a0 This would in turn   make the function larger....\u00a0...The question then is which one to drop?\u00a0 Let\u2019s first drop the exponential.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...This is a problem however, since ...diverges by the ....\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a larger function that is   divergent.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t say anything   about the smaller function.\u00a0 Therefore,   we chose the wrong one to drop....\u00a0...Let\u2019s try it again and this time let\u2019s drop the .......Also,...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is convergent.\u00a0 Therefore, by the Comparison test...is also convergent....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent....This is very similar to the previous example with a couple   of very important differences.\u00a0 First,   notice that the exponential now goes to zero as ... increases instead of growing larger as it did in the previous   example (because of the negative in the exponent).\u00a0 Also note that the exponential is now   subtracted off the ... instead of   added onto it....\u00a0...The fact that the exponential goes to zero means that this   time the ... in the denominator will   probably dominate the term and that means that the integral probably   diverges.\u00a0 We will therefore need to   find a smaller function that also diverges.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Making fractions smaller is pretty much the same as making   fractions larger.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll   need to either make the numerator smaller or the denominator larger....\u00a0...This is where the second change will come into play.\u00a0 As before we know that both ... and the exponential are   positive.\u00a0 However, this time since we   are subtracting the exponential from the ...   if we were to drop the exponential the denominator will become larger and so   the fraction will become smaller.\u00a0 In   other words,...and we know that ...diverges and so by the Comparison Test we know that ...must also diverge....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent....First notice that as with the first example, the numerator   in this function is going to be bounded since the sine is never larger than   1.\u00a0 Therefore, since the exponent on   the denominator is less than 1 we can guess that the integral will probably   diverge.\u00a0 We will need a smaller   function that also diverges....\u00a0...We know that ....\u00a0 In particular, this term is positive and so   if we drop it from the numerator the numerator will get smaller.\u00a0 This gives,...and...diverges so by the Comparison Test...also diverges....\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve seen a few examples of the Comparison Test now.\u00a0 However, most of them worked pretty much the same way.\u00a0 All the functions were rational and all we did for most of them was add or subtract something from the numerator or denominator to get what we want....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example that works a little differently so we don\u2019t get too locked into these ideas....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent....Normally, the presence of just an ... in the denominator would lead us to guess divergent for this   integral.\u00a0 However, the exponential in   the numerator will approach zero so fast that instead we\u2019ll need to guess   that this integral converges....\u00a0...To get a larger function we\u2019ll use the fact that we know   from the limits of integration that ....\u00a0 This means that if we just replace the ... in the denominator with 1 (which is   always smaller than ...) we will make   the denominator smaller and so the function will get larger. ...and we can show that ...converges.\u00a0 In fact,   we\u2019ve already done this for a lower limit of 3 and changing that to a 1 won\u2019t   change the convergence of the integral.\u00a0   Therefore, by the Comparison Test ...also converges....\u00a0...We should also really work an example that doesn\u2019t involve a rational function since there is no reason to assume that we\u2019ll always be working with rational functions....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent....We know that exponentials with negative exponents die down   to zero very fast so it makes sense to guess that this integral will be   convergent.\u00a0 We need a larger function,   but this time we don\u2019t have a fraction to work with so we\u2019ll need to do   something different....\u00a0...We\u2019ll take advantage of the fact that ...\u00a0is a decreasing function.\u00a0 This means that ...In other words, plug in a larger number and the function   gets smaller....\u00a0...From the limits of integration we know that ...\u00a0and this means that if we square ... it will get larger.\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...Note that we can only say this since ....\u00a0 This won\u2019t be true if ...!\u00a0 We can now use the fact that ...\u00a0is a decreasing function to get,...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is a larger function than ...\u00a0and we know that ...converges so by the Comparison Test we also know that...is convergent....\u00a0...The last two examples made use of the fact that ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at an example to see how do we would have to go about these if the lower limit had been smaller than 1....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent....First, we need to note that ...\u00a0is only true on the interval ...\u00a0as is illustrated in the graph below....\u00a0...So, we can\u2019t just proceed as we did in the previous   example with the Comparison Test on the interval ....\u00a0 However, this isn\u2019t the problem it might at   first appear to be.\u00a0 We can always   write the integral as follows,...\u00a0...We used ...   to get the value of the first integral.\u00a0   Now, if the second integral converges it will have a finite value and   so the sum of two finite values will also be finite and so the original   integral will converge.\u00a0 Likewise, if   the second integral diverges it will either be infinite or not have a value   at all and adding a finite number onto this will not all of a sudden make it   finite or exist and so the original integral will diverge.\u00a0 Therefore, this integral will converge or   diverge depending only on the convergence of the second integral....\u00a0...As we saw in Example 6 the second integral does converge   and so the whole integral must also converge....\u00a0...As we saw in this example, if we need to, we can split the integral up into one that doesn\u2019t involve any problems and can be computed and one that may contain a problem that we can use the Comparison Test on to determine its convergence.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/ImproperIntegralsCompTest.aspx", "media":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we need to take a look at a couple of different kinds of integrals.\u00a0 Both of these are examples of integrals that are called Improper Integrals.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the first kind of improper integrals that we\u2019re going to take a look at....\u00a0...In this kind of integral one or both of the limits of integration are infinity.\u00a0 In these cases the interval of integration is said to be over an infinite interval....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example that will also show us how we are going to deal with these integrals....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....This is an innocent enough looking integral.\u00a0 However, because infinity is not a real   number we can\u2019t just integrate as normal and then \u201cplug in\u201d the infinity to   get an answer....\u00a0...To see how we\u2019re going to do this integral let\u2019s think of   this as an area problem.\u00a0 So instead of   asking what the integral is, let\u2019s instead ask what the area under ...\u00a0on the interval ...\u00a0is....\u00a0...We still aren\u2019t able to do this, however, let\u2019s step back   a little and instead ask what the area under ...\u00a0is on the interval ...\u00a0where ...\u00a0and ...   is finite.\u00a0 This is a problem that we   can do....\u00a0...Now, we can get the area under ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0simply by taking the limit of ... as ... goes to infinity....This is then how we will do the integral itself....\u00a0...So, this is how we will deal with these kinds of integrals in general.\u00a0 We will replace the infinity with a variable (usually ...), do the integral and then take the limit of the result as ... goes to infinity....\u00a0...On a side note, notice that the area under a curve on an infinite interval was not infinity as we might have suspected it to be.\u00a0 In fact, it was a surprisingly small number. \u00a0Of course this won\u2019t always be the case, but it is important enough to point out that not all areas on an infinite interval will yield infinite areas....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now get some definitions out of the way.\u00a0 We will call these integrals ... if the associated limit exists and is a finite number (... it\u2019s not plus or minus infinity) and ... if the associated limit either doesn\u2019t exist or is (plus or minus) infinity....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now formalize up the method for dealing with infinite intervals.\u00a0 There are essentially three cases that we\u2019ll need to look at....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 provided the limit exists and is   finite....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

any number.\u00a0 Note as   well that this requires BOTH of the integrals to be convergent in order for   this integral to also be convergent.\u00a0   If either of the two integrals is divergent then so is this integral. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple more examples....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent and if it\u2019s convergent find   its value....So, the first thing we do is convert the integral to a   limit....\u00a0...Now, do the integral and the limit....\u00a0...So, the limit is infinite and so the integral is   divergent....\u00a0...If we go back to thinking in terms of area notice that the area under ...\u00a0on the interval ...\u00a0is infinite.\u00a0 This is in contrast to the area under ...\u00a0which was quite small.\u00a0 There really isn\u2019t all that much difference between these two functions and yet there is a large difference in the area under them.\u00a0 We can actually extend this out to the following fact....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0then...is convergent if ...\u00a0and divergent if .......\u00a0...One thing to note about this fact is that it\u2019s in essence saying that if an integrand goes to zero fast enough then the integral will converge.\u00a0 How fast is fast enough?\u00a0 If we use this fact as a guide it looks like integrands that go to zero faster than ...\u00a0goes to zero will probably converge....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple more examples....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 If it is convergent find its value....There really isn\u2019t much to do with these problems once you   know how to do them.\u00a0 We\u2019ll convert the   integral to a limit/integral pair, evaluate the integral and then the limit....\u00a0...So, the limit is infinite and so this integral is divergent....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 If it is convergent find its value....In this case we\u2019ve got infinities in both limits and so   we\u2019ll need to split the integral up into two separate integrals.\u00a0 We can split the integral up at any point,   so let\u2019s choose ...\u00a0since this will be a convenient point for   the evaluation process.\u00a0 The integral is   then,...\u00a0...We\u2019ve now got to look at each of the individual limits....\u00a0...So, the first integral is convergent.\u00a0 Note that this does NOT mean that the   second integral will also be convergent.\u00a0   So, let\u2019s take a look at that one....\u00a0...This integral is convergent and so since they are both   convergent the integral we were actually asked to deal with is also   convergent and its value is,...\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 If it is convergent find its value....First convert to a limit....This limit doesn\u2019t exist and so the integral is divergent....\u00a0...In most examples in a Calculus II class that are worked over infinite intervals the limit either exists or is infinite.\u00a0 However, there are limits that don\u2019t exist, as the previous example showed, so don\u2019t forget about those....\u00a0...We now need to look at the second type of improper integrals that we\u2019ll be looking at in this section.\u00a0 These are integrals that have discontinuous integrands.\u00a0 The process here is basically the same with one subtle difference.\u00a0 Here are the general cases that we\u2019ll look at for these integrals....\u00a0...provided the limit exists and is   finite.\u00a0 Note as well that we do need   to use a left hand limit here since the interval of integration is entirely   on the left side of the upper

of integration is entirely on the   right side of the lower limit....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...As with the infinite interval   case this requires BOTH of the integrals to be convergent in order for this   integral to also be convergent.\u00a0 If   either of the two integrals is divergent then so is this integral. ...\u00a0...Where ... is any number.\u00a0 Again,   this requires BOTH of the integrals to be convergent in order for this   integral to also be convergent....\u00a0...Note that the limits in these cases really do need to be right or left handed limits.\u00a0 Since we will be working inside the interval of integration we will need to make sure that we stay inside that interval.\u00a0 This means that we\u2019ll use one-sided limits to make sure we stay inside the interval.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a couple of examples of these kinds of integrals....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 If it is convergent find its value....The problem point is the upper limit so we are in the   first case above....The limit exists and is finite and so the integral   converges and the integral's value is .......\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 If it is convergent find its value....This integrand is not continuous at ...\u00a0and so we\u2019ll need to split the integral up   at that point....\u00a0...Now we need to look at each of these integrals and see if   they are convergent....At this point we\u2019re done.\u00a0   One of the integrals is divergent that means the integral that we were   asked to look at is divergent.\u00a0 We   don\u2019t even need to bother with the second integral....\u00a0...Before leaving this section let's note that we can also have integrals that involve both of these cases.\u00a0 Consider the following integral....\u00a0...Determine   if the following integral is convergent or divergent.\u00a0 If it is convergent find its value....This is an integral over an infinite interval that also   contains a discontinuous integrand.\u00a0 To   do this integral we\u2019ll need to split it up into two integrals.\u00a0 We can split it up anywhere, but pick a   value that will be convenient for evaluation purposes....\u00a0...In order for the integral in the example to be convergent   we will need BOTH of these to be convergent.\u00a0   If one or both are divergent then the whole integral will also be   divergent....\u00a0...We know that the second integral is convergent by the fact   given in the infinite interval portion above.\u00a0   So, all we need to do is check the first integral....\u00a0...So, the first integral is divergent

with square roots that had a general quadratic in them.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a quick look at another one like that since the idea involved in doing that kind of  integral is exactly what we are going to need for the other integrals in this section....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....Recall from the Trig Substitution section that in order to   do a trig substitution here we first needed to complete the square on the   quadratic.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...After completing the square the integral becomes,...\u00a0...Upon doing this we can identify the trig substitution that   we need.\u00a0 Here it is,...\u00a0...Recall that since we are doing an indefinite integral we   can drop the absolute value bars.\u00a0   Using this substitution the integral becomes,...\u00a0...We can finish the integral out with the following right   triangle....\u00a0...So, by completing the square we were able to take an integral that had a general quadratic in it and convert it into a form that allowed us to use a known integration technique....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a quick review of completing the square before proceeding.\u00a0 Here is the general completing the square formula that we\u2019ll use....\u00a0...This will always take a general quadratic and write it in terms of a squared term and a constant term....\u00a0...Recall as well that in order to do this we must have a coefficient of one in front of the ....\u00a0 If not we\u2019ll need to factor out the coefficient before completing the square.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see how completing the square can be used to do integrals that we aren\u2019t able to do at this point....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....Okay, this doesn\u2019t factor so partial fractions just won\u2019t

different from the previous   one.\u00a0 In this case we do have an ... in the numerator however the   numerator still isn\u2019t a multiple of the derivative of the denominator and so   a simple Calculus I substitution won\u2019t work....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s again complete the square on the denominator and   see what we get,...\u00a0...Upon completing the square the integral

the substitution back into the numerator as well....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in general when dealing with an integral in the form,...\u00a0...Here we are going to assume that the denominator doesn\u2019t factor and the numerator isn\u2019t a constant multiple of the derivative of the denominator.\u00a0 In these cases we complete the square on the denominator and then do a substitution that will yield an inverse tangent and/or a logarithm depending on the exact form of the numerator....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a look at a couple of integrals that are in the same general form as ... except the denominator will also be raised to a power.\u00a0 In other words, let\u2019s look at integrals in the form,...\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....For the most part this integral will work the same as the   previous two with one exception that will occur down the road.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s start by completing the square on   the quadratic in the denominator....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...Now, we will use the same substitution that we\u2019ve used to   this point in the previous two examples....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, here is where the differences start cropping up.\u00a0 The first integral can be done with the   substitution ...\u00a0and isn\u2019t too difficult.\u00a0 The second integral however, can\u2019t be done   with the substitution used on the first integral and it isn\u2019t an inverse   tangent....\u00a0...It turns out that a trig substitution will work nicely on   the second integral and it will be the same as we did ... we had square roots in the problem....\u00a0...With these two substitutions the integrals become,...\u00a0...Okay, at this point we\u2019ve got two options for the   remaining integral.\u00a0 We can either use   the ideas we learned in the ... about   integrals involving trig integrals or we could use the following formula....\u00a0...Let\u2019s use this formula to do the integral....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s use the following right triangle to get this   back to ...\u2019s....\u00a0...The cosine integral is then,...\u00a0...All told then the original integral is,...It\u2019s a long and messy answer, but there it is....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....As with the other problems we\u2019ll first complete the square   on the denominator....The integral is,...Now, let\u2019s do the substitution....and the integral is now,...\u00a0...In the first integral we\u2019ll use the substitution ...and in the second integral we\u2019ll use the following trig   substitution...\u00a0...Using these substitutions the integral becomes,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll need the following right triangle to finish this   integral out....\u00a0...So, going back to ...\u2019s   the integral becomes,...\u00a0...Often the following formula is needed when using the trig substitution that we used in the previous example....\u00a0...Note that we\u2019ll only need the two trig substitutions that we used here.\u00a0 The third trig substitution that we used will not be needed here.

use many of the properties and facts from the brief review of ... in the Extras chapter.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Using   the definition of the definite integral compute the following....First, we can\u2019t actually use the definition unless we   determine which points in each interval that well use for ....\u00a0 In order to make our life easier we\u2019ll use   the right endpoints of each interval....\u00a0...From the previous section we know that for a general ... the width of each subinterval is,...The subintervals are then,...\u00a0...As we can see the right endpoint of the ... subinterval is...\u00a0...The summation in the definition of the definite integral   is then,...\u00a0...Now, we are going to have to take a limit of this.\u00a0 That means that we are going to need to   \u201cevaluate\u201d this summation.\u00a0 In other   words, we are going to have to use the formulas given in the ... review to eliminate the   actual summation and get a formula for this for a

summation only ... changes and   so anything that isn\u2019t an ... will be   a constant and can be factored out of the summation.\u00a0 In particular any ... that is in the summation can be factored out if we need to....\u00a0...Here is the summation \u201cevaluation\u201d....\u00a0...We can now compute the definite integral....We\u2019ve seen several methods for dealing with the limit in   this problem so I\u2019ll leave it to you to verify the results....\u00a0...Wow, that was a lot of work for a fairly simple function.\u00a0 There is a much simpler way of evaluating these and we will get to it eventually.\u00a0 The main purpose to this section is to get the main properties and facts about the definite integral out of the way.\u00a0 We\u2019ll discuss how we compute these in practice starting with the next section....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start taking a look at some of the properties of the definite integral....\u00a0...1.....\u00a0 We can interchange the limits on any   definite integral, all that we need to do is tack a minus sign onto the   integral when we do.\u00a0 ...   ...   ...2.....\u00a0 If the upper and lower limits are the same   then there is no work to do, the integral is zero....   ...   ...3....,   where ... is any number.\u00a0 So, as with limits, derivatives, and   indefinite integrals we can factor out a constant....   ...   ...4.....\u00a0 We can break up definite integrals across a   sum or difference....   ...   ...5....\u00a0where ...   is any number.\u00a0 This property is more   important than we might realize at first.\u00a0   One of

.......   ...   ...6.....\u00a0 The point of this property is to notice   that as long as the function and limits are the same the variable of   integration that we use in the definite integral won\u2019t affect the answer....\u00a0...See the ... section of the Extras chapter for the proof of properties 1 ...\u00a04.\u00a0 Property 5 is not easy to prove and so is not shown there.\u00a0 Property 6 is not really a property in the full sense of the word.\u00a0 It is only here to acknowledge that as long as the function and limits are the same it doesn\u2019t matter what letter we use for the variable.\u00a0 The answer will be the same....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a couple of examples dealing with these properties....\u00a0...Use   the results from the first example to evaluate each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...All of the solutions to these problems will rely on the   fact we proved in the first example.\u00a0   Namely that,... ...In this case the only difference between the two is that   the limits have interchanged.\u00a0 So,   using the first property gives,...\u00a0... ...For this part notice that we can factor a 10 out of both   terms and then out of the integral using the third property....\u00a0... ...In this case the only difference is the letter used and so   this is just going to use property 6....\u00a0...Here are a couple of examples using the other properties....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following definite integral....There really isn\u2019t anything to do with this integral once   we notice that the limits are the same.\u00a0   Using the second property this is,...\u00a0...Given   that ...\u00a0and ...determine the value of...We will first need to use the fourth property to break up   the integral and the third property to factor out the constants....\u00a0...Now notice that the limits on the first integral are   interchanged with the limits on the given integral so switch them using the   first property above (and adding a minus sign of course).\u00a0 Once this is done we can plug in the known   values of the integrals....\u00a0...\u00a0...Given   that ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0determine the value of .......This example is mostly an example of property 5 although   there are a couple of uses of property 1 in the solution as well....\u00a0...We need to figure out how to correctly break up the   integral using property 5 to allow us to use the given pieces of   information.\u00a0 First we\u2019ll note that   there is an integral that has a \u201c-5\u201d in one of the limits.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the lower limit, but we can use   property 1 to correct that eventually.\u00a0   The other limit is 100 so this is the number ... that we\u2019ll use in property 5....\u00a0...We\u2019ll be able to get the value of the first integral, but   the second still isn\u2019t in the list of know integrals.\u00a0 However, we do have second limit that has a   limit of 100 in it.\u00a0 The other limit   for this second integral is -10 and this will be ... in this application of property 5....\u00a0...At this point all that we need to do is use the property 1   on the first and third integral to get the limits to match up with the known   integrals.\u00a0 After that we can plug in   for the known integrals....\u00a0...There are also some nice properties that we can use in comparing the general size of definite integrals.\u00a0 Here they are....\u00a0...7....,   ... is any number....8....If   ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0then ....   ...9....\u00a0\u00a0If ...\u00a0for ...then .......10....If ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0then .......11....\u00a0...\u00a0...See the ... section of the Extras chapter for the proof of these properties.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are a couple of quick interpretations of the definite integral that we can give here....\u00a0...First, as we alluded to in the previous section one possible interpretation of the definite integral is to give the net area between the graph of ...\u00a0and the ...-axis on the interval [...].\u00a0 So, the net area between the graph of ...\u00a0and the ...-axis on [0,2] is,...\u00a0...If you look back in the last section this was the exact area that was given for the initial set of problems that we looked at in this area....\u00a0...Another interpretation is sometimes called the Net Change Theorem.\u00a0 This interpretation says that if ...\u00a0is some quantity (so ...\u00a0is the rate of change of ..., then,...\u00a0is the net change in ...\u00a0on the interval [...,...].\u00a0 In other words, compute the definite integral of a rate of change and you\u2019ll get the net change in the quantity.\u00a0 We can see that the value of the definite integral, ..., does in fact give use the net change in ...\u00a0and so there really isn\u2019t anything to prove with this statement.\u00a0 This is really just an acknowledgment of what the definite integral of a rate of change tells us....\u00a0...So as a quick example, if ...\u00a0is the volume of water in a tank then,...is the net change in the volume as we go from time ...\u00a0to time .......\u00a0...Likewise, if ...\u00a0is the function giving the position of some object at time ... we know that the velocity of the object at any time ... is : ....\u00a0 Therefore the displacement of the object time ...\u00a0to time ...\u00a0is,...Note that in this case if ...\u00a0is both positive and negative (... the object moves to both the right and left) in the time frame this will NOT give the total distance traveled.\u00a0 It will only give the displacement, ... the difference between where the object started and where it ended up.\u00a0 To get the total distance traveled by an object we\u2019d have to compute,...\u00a0...It is important to note here that the Net Change Theorem only really makes sense if we\u2019re integrating a derivative of a function....\u00a0...As noted by the title above this is only the first part to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\u00a0 We will give the second part in the next section as it is the key to easily computing definite integrals and that is the subject of the next section....\u00a0...The first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us how to differentiate certain types of definite integrals and it also tells us about the very close relationship between integrals and derivatives....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is continuous on [...] then,...is continuous on [...]   and it is differentiable on ...\u00a0and that,...\u00a0...An alternate notation for the derivative portion of this is,...\u00a0...To see the proof of this see the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check out a couple of quick examples using this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...This one is nothing more than a quick application of the   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus....\u00a0... ...This one needs a little work before we can use the   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\u00a0 The   first thing to notice is that the FToC requires the lower limit to be a   constant and the upper limit to be the variable.\u00a0 So, using a property of definite integrals   we can interchange the limits of the integral we just need to remember to add   in a minus sign after we do that.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The next thing to notice is that the FToC also requires an   ... in the upper limit of integration   and we\u2019ve got ....\u00a0 To do this derivative we\u2019re going to need   the following version of the .......\u00a0...So, if we let ...   we use the chain rule to get,...\u00a0...The final step is to get everything back in terms of .......\u00a0...Using the chain rule as we did in the last part of this example we can derive some general formulas for some more complicated problems....\u00a0...First,...\u00a0...This is simply the chain rule for these kinds of problems....\u00a0...Next, we can get a formula for integrals in which the upper limit is a constant and the lower limit is a function of ....\u00a0 All we need to do here is interchange the limits on the integral (adding in a minus sign of course) and then using the formula above to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Finally, we can also get a version for both limits being functions of ....\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll need to use Property 5 above to break up the integral as follows,...\u00a0...We can use pretty much any value of ... when we break up the integral.\u00a0 The only thing that we need to avoid is to make sure that ...\u00a0exists.\u00a0 So, assuming that ...\u00a0exists after we break up the integral we can then differentiate and use the two formulas above to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a quick example....\u00a0...Differentiate   the following integral....This will use the final formula that we derived above.", "url":

with an integral that we can already do so we can contrast it with the integrals that we\u2019ll be doing in this section....\u00a0...So, if the numerator is the derivative of the denominator (or a constant multiple of the derivative of the denominator) doing this kind of integral is fairly simple.\u00a0 However, often the numerator isn\u2019t the derivative of the denominator (or a constant multiple).\u00a0 For example, consider the following integral....\u00a0...In this case the numerator is definitely not the derivative of the denominator nor is it a constant multiple of the derivative of the denominator.\u00a0 Therefore, the simple substitution that we used above won\u2019t work.\u00a0 However, if we notice that the integrand can be broken up as follows,...then the integral is actually quite simple....\u00a0...This process of taking a rational expression and decomposing it into simpler rational expressions that we can add or subtract to get the original rational expression is called ....\u00a0 Many integrals involving rational expressions can be done if we first do partial fractions on the integrand....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s do a quick review of partial fractions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with a rational expression in the form,...where both ... and ... are polynomials and the degree of ... is smaller than the degree of ....\u00a0 Recall that the degree of a polynomial is the largest exponent in the polynomial.\u00a0\u00a0 Partial fractions can only be done if the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator.\u00a0 That is important to remember....\u00a0...So, once we\u2019ve determined that partial fractions can be done we factor the denominator as completely as possible.\u00a0 Then for each factor in the denominator we can use the following table to determine the term(s) we pick up in the partial fraction decomposition....\u00a0...Factor in...denominator...Term in partial...fraction   decomposition...,\u00a0 ...,\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that the first and third cases are really special cases of the second and fourth cases respectively....\u00a0...There are several methods for determining the coefficients for each term and we will go over each of those in the following examples....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start the examples by doing the integral above....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....The first step is to factor the denominator as much as   possible and get the form of the partial fraction decomposition.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The next step is to actually add the right side back up....\u00a0...Now, we need to choose ...   and ... so that the numerators of   these two are equal for every ....\u00a0 To do this we\u2019ll need to set the numerators   equal....\u00a0...Note that in most problems we will go straight from the   general form of the decomposition to this step and not bother with actually   adding the terms back up.\u00a0 The only point   to adding the terms is to get the numerator and we can get that without   actually writing down the results of the addition....\u00a0...At this point we have one of two ways to proceed.\u00a0 One way will always work, but is often more   work.\u00a0 The other, while it won\u2019t always   work, is often quicker when it does work.\u00a0   In this case both will work and so we\u2019ll use the quicker way for this   example.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a look at the   other method in a later example....\u00a0...What we\u2019re going to do here is to notice that the   numerators must be equal for ...   that we would choose to use.\u00a0 In   particular the numerators must be equal for ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s plug these in and see what we   get....\u00a0...So, by carefully picking the ...\u2019s we got the unknown constants to quickly drop out.\u00a0 Note that these are the values we claimed   they would be above....\u00a0...At this point there really isn\u2019t a whole lot to do other   than the integral....\u00a0...Recall that to do this integral we first split it up into   two integrals and then used the substitutions,...on the integrals to get the final answer....\u00a0...Before moving onto the next example a couple of quick notes are in order here.\u00a0 First, many of the integrals in partial fractions problems come down to the type of integral seen above.\u00a0 Make sure that you can do those integrals.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There is also another integral that often shows up in these kinds of problems so we may as well give the formula for it here since we are already on the subject....\u00a0...\u00a0...It will be an example or two before we use this so don\u2019t forget about it....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....We won\u2019t be putting as much detail into this solution as   we did in the previous example.\u00a0 The   first thing is to factor the denominator and get the form of the partial   fraction decomposition....\u00a0...The next step is to set numerators equal.\u00a0 If you need to actually add the right side   together to get the numerator for that side then you should do so, however,   it will definitely make the problem quicker if you can do the addition in   your head to get,...\u00a0...As with the previous example it looks like we can just   pick a few values of ... and find the   constants so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Note that unlike the first example most of the   coefficients here are fractions.\u00a0 That   is not unusual so don\u2019t get excited about it when it happens....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s do the integral....\u00a0...Again, as noted above, integrals that generate natural   logarithms are very common in these problems so make sure you can do them....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....This time the denominator is already factored so let\u2019s   just jump right to the partial fraction decomposition....Setting numerators gives,...\u00a0...In this case we aren\u2019t going to be able to just pick   values of ... that will give us all   the constants.\u00a0 Therefore, we will need   to work this the second (and often longer) way.\u00a0 The first step is to multiply out the right   side and collect all the like terms together.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Now we need to choose ...,   ..., ..., and ... so that these   two are equal.\u00a0 In other words we will   need to set the coefficients of like powers of ... equal.\u00a0 This will give a   system of equations that can be solved....\u00a0...Note that we used ...   to represent the constants.\u00a0 Also note   that these systems can often be quite large and have a fair amount of work   involved in solving them.\u00a0 The best way   to deal with these is to use some form of computer aided solving techniques....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at the integral....\u00a0...\u00a0...In order to take care of the third term we needed to split   it up into two separate terms.\u00a0 Once   we\u2019ve done this we can do all the integrals in the problem.\u00a0 The first two use the substitution ...,   the third uses the substitution ...\u00a0and the fourth term uses the formula given   above for inverse tangents....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....Let\u2019s first get the general form of the partial fraction   decomposition....\u00a0...Now, set numerators equal, expand the right side and   collect like terms....\u00a0...Setting coefficient equal gives the following system....\u00a0...Don\u2019t get excited if some of the coefficients end up being   zero.\u00a0 It happens on occasion....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the integral....\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve only looked at rational expressions where the degree of the numerator was strictly less that the degree of the denominator.\u00a0 Of course not all rational expressions will fit into this form and so we need to take a look at a couple of examples where this isn\u2019t the case....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....So, in this case the degree of the numerator is 4 and the   degree of the denominator is 3.\u00a0   Therefore, partial fractions can\u2019t be done on this rational   expression....\u00a0...To fix this up we\u2019ll need to do long division on this to   get it into a form that we can deal with.\u00a0   Here is the work for that....\u00a0...So, from the long division we see that,...and the integral becomes,...\u00a0...The first integral we can do easily enough and the second   integral is now in a form that allows us to do partial fractions.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s get the general form of the   partial fractions for the second integrand....Setting numerators equal gives us,...\u00a0...Now, there is a variation of the method we used in the   first couple of examples that will work here.\u00a0   There are a couple of values of ...   that will allow us to quickly get two of the three constants, but there is no   value of ... that will just hand us   the third....\u00a0...What we\u2019ll do in this example is pick ...\u2019s to get the two constants that we can easily get and then   we\u2019ll just pick another value of ...   that will be easy to work with (...   it won\u2019t give large/messy numbers anywhere) and then we\u2019ll use the fact that   we also know the other two constants to find the third....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...In the previous example there were actually two different ways of dealing with the ... in the denominator.\u00a0 One is to treat it as a quadratic which would give the following term in the decomposition...and the other is to treat it as a linear term in the following way,...which gives the following two terms in the decomposition,...\u00a0...We used the second way of thinking about it in our example.\u00a0 Notice however that the two will give identical partial fraction decompositions.\u00a0 So, why talk about this?\u00a0 Simple.\u00a0 This will work for ..., but what about ... or ...?\u00a0 In these cases we really will need to use the second way of thinking about these kinds of terms....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at one more example....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....In this case the numerator and denominator have the same   degree.\u00a0 As with the last example we\u2019ll   need to do long division to get this into the correct form.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave the details of that to you to   check....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ll need to partial fraction the second   integral.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the decomposition....Setting numerator equal gives,...\u00a0...Picking value of ...   gives us the following coefficients....The integral is then,...\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/PartialFractions.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus II - Partial Fractions", "subject":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to look at quite a few integrals involving trig functions and some of the techniques we can use to help us evaluate them.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off with an integral that we should already be able to do....\u00a0...\u00a0...This integral is easy to do with a substitution because the presence of the cosine, however, what about the following integral....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....\u00a0...This integral no longer has the cosine in it that would   allow us to use the substitution that we used above.\u00a0 Therefore, that substitution won\u2019t work and   we are going to have to find another way of doing this integral....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first notice that we could write the integral as   follows,...\u00a0...Now recall the trig identity,...\u00a0...With this identity the integral can be written as,...\u00a0...and we can now use the substitution ....\u00a0 Doing this gives us,...\u00a0...So, with a little rewriting on the integrand we were able   to reduce this to a fairly simple substitution....\u00a0...Notice that we were able to do the rewrite that we did in the previous example because the exponent on the sine was odd.\u00a0 In these cases all that we need to do is strip out one of the sines.\u00a0 The exponent on the remaining sines will then be even and we can easily convert the remaining sines to cosines using the identity,...\u00a0...If the exponent on the sines had been even this would have been difficult to do.\u00a0 We could strip out a sine, but the remaining sines would then have an odd exponent and while we could convert them to cosines the resulting integral would often be even more difficult than the original integral in most cases....So, in this case we\u2019ve got both sines and cosines in the   problem and in this case the exponent on the sine is even while the exponent   on the cosine is odd.\u00a0 So, we can use a   similar technique in this integral.\u00a0   This time we\u2019ll strip out a cosine and convert the rest to sines....\u00a0...At this point let\u2019s pause for a second to summarize what we\u2019ve learned so far about integrating powers of sine and cosine.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this integral if the exponent on the sines (...) is odd we can strip out one sine, convert the rest to cosines using ... and then use the substitution ....\u00a0 Likewise, if the exponent on the cosines (...) is odd we can strip out one cosine and convert the rest to sines and the use the substitution .......\u00a0...Of course, if both exponents are odd then we can use either method.\u00a0 However, in these cases it\u2019s usually easier to convert the term with the smaller exponent....\u00a0...The one case we haven\u2019t looked at is what happens if both of the exponents are even?\u00a0 In this case the technique we used in the first couple of examples simply won\u2019t work and in fact there really isn\u2019t any one set method for doing these integrals.\u00a0 Each integral is different and in some cases there will be more than one way to do the integral....\u00a0...With that being said most, if not all, of integrals involving products of sines and cosines in which both exponents are even can be done using one or more of the following formulas to rewrite the integrand....\u00a0...The first two formulas are the standard half angle formula from a trig class written in a form that will be more convenient for us to use.\u00a0 The last is the standard double angle formula for sine, again with a small rewrite....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....As noted above there are often more than one way to do   integrals in which both of the exponents are even.\u00a0 This integral is an example of that.\u00a0 There are at least two solution techniques   for this problem.\u00a0 We will do both   solutions starting with what is probably the harder of the two, but it\u2019s also   the one that many people see first....\u00a0...In this solution we will use the two half angle formulas   above and just substitute them into the integral....\u00a0...So, we still have an integral that can\u2019t be completely   done, however notice that we have managed to reduce the integral down to just   one term causing problems (a cosine with an even power) rather than two terms   causing problems....\u00a0...In fact to eliminate the remaining problem term all that   we need to do is reuse the first half angle formula given above....So, this solution required a total of three trig   identities to complete....\u00a0...In this solution we will use the half angle formula to   help simplify the integral as follows....Now, we use the double angle formula for sine to reduce to   an integral that we can do....This method required only two trig identities to complete....\u00a0...Notice that the difference between these two methods is   more one of \u201cmessiness\u201d.\u00a0 The second   method is not appreciably easier (other than needing one less trig identity)   it is just not as messy and that will often translate into an \u201ceasier\u201d   process....\u00a0...In the previous example we saw two different solution methods that gave the same answer.\u00a0 Note that this will not always happen.\u00a0 In fact, more often than not we will get different answers.\u00a0 However, as we discussed in the ... section, the two answers will differ by no more than a constant....\u00a0...In general when we have products of sines and cosines in which both exponents are even we will need to use a series of half angle and/or double angle formulas to reduce the integral into a form that we can integrate.\u00a0 Also, the larger the exponents the more we\u2019ll need to use these formulas and hence the messier the problem....\u00a0...Sometimes in the process of reducing integrals in which both exponents are even we will run across products of sine and cosine in which the arguments are different.\u00a0 These will require one of the following formulas to reduce the products to integrals that we can do....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example of one of these kinds of integrals....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....This integral requires the last formula listed above....\u00a0...Okay, at this point we\u2019ve covered pretty much all the possible cases involving products of sines and cosines.\u00a0 It\u2019s now time to look at integrals that involve products of secants and tangents....\u00a0...This time, let\u2019s do a little analysis of the possibilities before we just jump into examples.\u00a0 The general integral will be,...\u00a0...The first thing to notice is that we can easily convert even powers of secants to tangents and even powers of tangents to secants by using a formula similar to ....\u00a0 In fact, the formula can be derived from ... so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, we\u2019re going to want to deal with ... similarly to how we dealt with ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll want to eventually use one of the following substitutions....\u00a0...So, if we use the substitution ...\u00a0we will need two secants left for the substitution to work.\u00a0 This means that if the exponent on the secant (...) is even we can strip two out and then convert the remaining secants to tangents using .......\u00a0...Next, if we want to use the substitution ...we will need one secant and one tangent left over in order to use the substitution.\u00a0 This means that if the exponent on the tangent (...) is odd and we have at least one secant in the integrand we can strip out one of the tangents along with one of the secants of course.\u00a0\u00a0 The tangent will then have an even exponent and so we can use ... to convert the rest of the tangents to secants.\u00a0 Note that this method does require that we have at least one secant in the integral as well.\u00a0 If there aren\u2019t any secants then we\u2019ll need to do something different....\u00a0...If the exponent on the secant is even and the exponent on the tangent is odd then we can use either case.\u00a0 Again, it will be easier to convert the term with the smallest exponent....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....First note that since the exponent on the secant isn\u2019t   even we can\u2019t use the substitution ....\u00a0 However, the exponent on the tangent is odd   and we\u2019ve got a secant in the integral and so we will be able to use the   substitution ....\u00a0 This means stripping out a single tangent   (along with a secant) and converting the remaining tangents to secants using .......\u00a0...Here\u2019s the work for this integral....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....So, in this example the exponent on the tangent is even so   the substitution ...\u00a0won\u2019t work.\u00a0   The exponent on the secant is even and so we can use the substitution ...\u00a0for this integral.\u00a0 That means that we need to strip out two   secants and convert the rest to tangents.\u00a0   Here is the work for this integral....\u00a0...Both of the previous examples fit very nicely into the patterns discussed above and so were not all that difficult to work.\u00a0 However, there are a couple of exceptions to the patterns above and in these cases there is no single method that will work for every problem.\u00a0 Each integral will be different and may require different solution methods in order to evaluate the integral....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first take a look at a couple of integrals that have odd exponents on the tangents, but no secants.\u00a0 In these cases we can\u2019t use the substitution ...since it requires there to be at least one secant in the integral. ...\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....To do this integral all we need to do is recall the   definition of tangent in terms of sine and cosine and then this integral is   nothing more than a Calculus I substitution....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....The trick to this one is do the following manipulation of   the integrand....We can now use the substitution ...\u00a0on the first integral and the results from   the previous example on the second integral....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...Note that all odd powers of tangent (with the exception of the first power) can be integrated using the same method we used in the previous example.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, a quick substitution ( ...) will give us the first integral and the second integral will always be the previous odd power....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples in which the exponent on the secant is odd and the exponent on the tangent is even.\u00a0 In these cases the substitutions used above won\u2019t work....\u00a0...It should also be noted that both of the following two integrals are integrals that we\u2019ll be seeing on occasion in later sections of this chapter and in later chapters.\u00a0 Because of this it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to make a note of these results so you\u2019ll have them ready when you need them later....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....This one isn\u2019t too bad once you see what you\u2019ve got to   do.\u00a0 By itself the integral can\u2019t be   done.\u00a0 However, if we manipulate the   integrand as follows we can do it....\u00a0...In this form we can do the integral using the substitution   ....\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The idea used in the above example is a nice idea to keep in mind.\u00a0 Multiplying the numerator and denominator of a term by the same term above can, on occasion, put the integral into a form that can be integrated.\u00a0 Note that this method won\u2019t always work and even when it does it won\u2019t always be clear what you need to multiply the numerator and denominator by.\u00a0 However, when it does work and you can figure out what term you need it can greatly simplify the integral....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the next example....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....This one is different from any of the other integrals that   we\u2019ve done in this section.\u00a0 The first   step to doing this integral is to perform integration by parts using the   following choices for ... and .......\u00a0...Note that using integration by parts on this problem is   not an obvious choice, but it does work very nicely here.\u00a0 After doing integration by parts we have,...\u00a0...Now the new integral also has an odd exponent on the   secant and an even exponent on the tangent and so the previous examples of   products of secants and tangents still won\u2019t do us any good....\u00a0...To do this integral we\u2019ll first write the tangents in the   integral in terms of secants.\u00a0 Again,   this is not necessarily an obvious choice but it\u2019s what we need to do in this   case....\u00a0...Now, we can use the results from the previous example to do   the second integral and notice that the first integral is exactly the   integral we\u2019re being asked to evaluate with a minus sign in front.\u00a0 So, add it to both sides to get,...\u00a0...Finally divide by two and we\u2019re done....\u00a0...Again, note that we\u2019ve again used the idea of integrating the right side until the original integral shows up and then moving this to the left side and dividing by its coefficient to complete the evaluation.\u00a0 We first saw this in the ... section and noted at the time that this was a nice technique to remember.\u00a0 Here is another example of this technique....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve looked at products of secants and tangents let\u2019s also acknowledge that because we can relate cosecants and cotangents by ...all of the work that we did for products of secants and tangents will also work for products of cosecants and cotangents.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that....\u00a0...There is one final topic to be discussed in this section before moving on. ...\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve looked only at products of sines and cosines and products of secants and tangents.\u00a0 However, the methods used to do these integrals can also be used on some quotients involving sines and cosines and quotients involving secants and tangents (and hence quotients involving cosecants and cotangents)....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example of this....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....If this were a product of sines and cosines we would know   what to do.\u00a0 We would strip out a sine   (since the exponent on the sine is odd) and convert the rest of the sines to   cosines.\u00a0 The same idea will work in   this case.\u00a0 We\u2019ll strip out a sine from   the numerator and convert the rest to cosines as follows,...\u00a0...At this point all we need to do is use the substitution ...and we\u2019re done....\u00a0...So, under the right circumstances, we can use the ideas developed to help us deal with products of trig functions to deal with quotients of trig functions.\u00a0 The natural question then, is just what are the right circumstances?...\u00a0...First notice that if the quotient had been reversed as in this integral,...we wouldn\u2019t have been able to strip out a sine....\u00a0...In this case the \u201cstripped out\u201d sine remains in the denominator and it won\u2019t do us any good for the substitution ...since this substitution requires a sine in the numerator of the quotient.\u00a0 Also note that, while we could convert the sines to cosines, the resulting integral would still be a fairly difficult integral....\u00a0...So, we can use the methods we applied to products of trig functions to quotients of trig functions provided the term that needs parts stripped out in is the numerator of the quotient.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/IntegralsWithTrig.aspx", "media": "text",

take a look at the following....\u00a0...So, that was simple enough.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a look at,...\u00a0...To do this integral we\u2019ll use the following substitution....\u00a0...Again, simple enough to do provided you remember how to do ....\u00a0 By the way make sure that you can do these kinds of substitutions quickly and easily.\u00a0 From this point on we are going to be doing these kinds of substitutions in our head.\u00a0 If you have to stop and write these out with every problem you will find that it will take you significantly longer to do these problems....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s look at the integral that we really want to do....\u00a0...If we just had an ... by itself or ...\u00a0by itself we could do the integral easily enough.\u00a0 But, we don\u2019t have them by themselves, they are instead multiplied together.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There is no substitution that we can use on this integral that will allow us to do the integral.\u00a0 So, at this point we don\u2019t have the knowledge to do this integral.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To do this integral we will need to use integration by parts so let\u2019s derive the integration by parts formula.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with the product rule....\u00a0...Now, integrate both sides of this....\u00a0...The left side is easy enough to integrate and we\u2019ll split up the right side of the integral....\u00a0...Note that technically we should have had a constant of integration show up on the left side after doing the integration.\u00a0 We can drop it at this point since other constants of integration will be showing up down the road and they would just end up absorbing this one....\u00a0...Finally, rewrite the formula as follows and we arrive at the integration by parts formula....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is not the easiest formula to use however.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s do a couple of substitutions....\u00a0...Both of these are just the standard Calc I substitutions that hopefully you are used to by now.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get excited by the fact that we are using two substitutions here.\u00a0 They will work the same way.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Using these substitutions gives us the formula that most people think of as the integration by parts formula....\u00a0...\u00a0...To use this formula we will need to identify ... and ..., compute ... and ... and then use the formula.\u00a0 Note as well that computing ... is very easy.\u00a0 All we need to do is integrate .......\u00a0...So, let\u2019s take a look at the integral above that we mentioned we wanted to do....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....So, on some level, the problem here is the ... that is in front of the   exponential.\u00a0 If that wasn\u2019t there we   could do the integral.\u00a0 Notice as well   that in doing integration by parts anything that we choose for ... will be differentiated.\u00a0 So, it seems that choosing ...\u00a0will be a good choice since upon   differentiating the ... will drop   out.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve chosen ...   we know that ... will be everything   else that remains.\u00a0 So, here are the   choices for ... and ... as well as ... and .......The integral is then,...\u00a0...Once we have done the last integral in the problem we will   add in the constant of integration to get our final answer....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s take a look at integration by parts for definite integrals.\u00a0 The integration by parts formula for definite integrals is,...\u00a0...Note that the ...\u00a0in the first term is just the standard integral evaluation notation that you should be familiar with at this point.\u00a0 All we do is evaluate the term, ... in this case, at ... then subtract off the evaluation of the term at .......\u00a0...At some level we don\u2019t really need a formula here because we know that when doing definite integrals all we need to do is do the indefinite integral and then do the evaluation.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at a definite integral using integration by parts....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....This is the same integral that we looked at in the first   example so we\u2019ll use the same ... and   ... to get,...\u00a0...Since we need to be able to do the indefinite integral in order to do the definite integral and doing the definite integral amounts to nothing more than evaluating the indefinite integral at a couple of points we will concentrate on doing indefinite integrals in the rest of this section.\u00a0 In fact, throughout most of this chapter this will be the case.\u00a0 We will be doing far more indefinite integrals than definite integrals....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some more examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....There are two ways to proceed with this example.\u00a0 For many, the first thing that they try is   multiplying the cosine through the parenthesis, splitting up the integral and   then doing integration by parts on the first integral.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...While that is a perfectly acceptable way of doing the   problem it\u2019s more work than we really need to do.\u00a0 Instead of splitting the integral up let\u2019s   instead use the following choices for ...   and .......The integral is then,...Notice that we pulled any constants out of the integral   when we used the integration by parts formula.\u00a0 We will usually do this in order to   simplify the integral a little....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....For this example we\u2019ll use the following choices for ... and .......The integral is then,...\u00a0...In this example, unlike the previous examples, the new   integral will also require integration by parts.\u00a0 For this second integral we will use the   following choices....So, the integral becomes,...Be careful with the coefficient on the integral for the   second application of integration by parts.\u00a0   Since the integral is multiplied by ...\u00a0we need to make sure that the results of   actually doing the integral are also multiplied by ....\u00a0 Forgetting to do this is one of the more   common mistakes with integration by parts problems....\u00a0...As this last example has shown us, we will sometimes need more than one application of integration by parts to completely evaluate an integral.\u00a0 This is something that will happen so don\u2019t get excited about it when it does....\u00a0...In this next example we need to acknowledge an important point about integration techniques.\u00a0 Some integrals can be done in using several different techniques.\u00a0 That is the case with the integral in the next example....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral...Using   Integration by Parts.\u00a0\u00a0 ...Using   a standard Calculus I substitution.\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...\u00a0...First notice that there are no trig functions or   exponentials in this integral.\u00a0 While a   good many integration by parts integrals will involve trig functions and/or   exponentials not all of them will so don\u2019t get too locked into the idea of   expecting them to show up....\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ll use the following choices for ... and .......The integral is then,... ...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s do the integral with a substitution.\u00a0 We can use the following substitution....\u00a0...Notice that we\u2019ll actually use the substitution twice,   once for the quantity under the square root and once for the ... in front of the square root.\u00a0 The integral is then,...\u00a0...So, we used two different integration techniques in this example and we got two different answers.\u00a0 The obvious question then should be : Did we do something wrong?...\u00a0...Actually, we didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u00a0 We need to ... the following fact from Calculus I....\u00a0...\u00a0...In other words, if two functions have the same derivative then they will differ by no more than a constant.\u00a0 So, how does this apply to the above problem?\u00a0 First define the following,...\u00a0...Then we can compute ...and ...\u00a0by integrating as follows,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll use integration by parts for the first integral and the substitution for the second integral.\u00a0 Then according to the fact ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0should differ by no more than a constant.\u00a0 Let\u2019s verify this and see if this is the case. We can verify that they differ by no more than a constant if we take a look at the difference of the two and do a little algebraic manipulation and simplification....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this case it turns out the two functions are exactly the same function since the difference is zero.\u00a0 Note that this won\u2019t always happen.\u00a0 Sometimes the difference will yield a nonzero constant.\u00a0 For an example of this check out the ... section in my Calculus I notes....\u00a0...So just what have we learned?\u00a0 First, there will, on occasion, be more than one method for evaluating an integral.\u00a0 Secondly, we saw that different methods will often lead to different answers.\u00a0 Last, even though the answers are different it can be shown, sometimes with a lot of work, that they differ by no more than a constant....\u00a0...When we are faced with an integral the first thing that we\u2019ll need to decide is if there is more than one way to do the integral.\u00a0 If there is more than one way we\u2019ll then need to determine which method we should use.\u00a0 The general rule of thumb that I use in my classes is that you should use the method that ... find easiest.\u00a0 This may not be the method that others find easiest, but that doesn\u2019t make it the wrong method....\u00a0...One of the more common mistakes with integration by parts is for people to get too locked into perceived patterns.\u00a0 For instance, all of the previous examples used the basic pattern of taking ... to be the polynomial that sat in front of another function and then letting ... be the other function.\u00a0 This will not always happen so we need to be careful and not get locked into any patterns that we think we see....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some integrals that don\u2019t fit into the above pattern.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....So, unlike any of the other integral we\u2019ve done to this   point there is only a single function in the integral and no polynomial sitting   in front of the logarithm....\u00a0...The first choice of many people here is to try and fit   this into the pattern from above and make the following choices for ... and .......\u00a0...This leads to a real problem however since that means ... must be,...In other words, we would need to know the answer ahead of   time in order to actually do the problem.\u00a0   So, this choice simply won\u2019t work.\u00a0   Also notice that with this choice we\u2019d get that ...\u00a0which also causes problems and is another   reason why this choice will not work....\u00a0...Therefore, if the logarithm doesn\u2019t belong in the ... it must belong instead in the ....\u00a0   So, let\u2019s use the following choices instead...The integral is then,...\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....So, if we again try to use the pattern from the first few   examples for this integral our choices for ... and ... would probably   be the following....However, as with the previous example this won\u2019t work   since we can\u2019t easily compute .......\u00a0...This is not an easy integral to do.\u00a0 However, notice that if we had an ... in the integral along   with the root we could very easily do the integral with a substitution.\u00a0 Also notice that we do have a lot of ...\u2019s floating around in the original   integral.\u00a0 So instead of putting all   the ...\u2019s (outside of the root) in   the ... let\u2019s split them up as   follows....\u00a0...We can now easily compute ... and after using integration by parts we get,...\u00a0...So, in the previous two examples we saw cases that didn\u2019t quite fit into any perceived pattern that we might have gotten from the first couple of examples.\u00a0 This is always something that we need to be on the lookout for with integration by parts....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example that also illustrates another integration technique that sometimes arises out of integration by parts problems....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....Okay, to this point we\u2019ve always picked ... in such a way that upon   differentiating it would make that portion go away or at the very least put   it the integral into a form that would make it easier to deal with.\u00a0 In this case no matter which part we make ... it will never go away in the   differentiation process....\u00a0...It doesn\u2019t much matter which we choose to be ... so we\u2019ll choose in the following   way.\u00a0 Note however that we could choose   the other way as well and we\u2019ll get the same result in the end....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ll do integration by parts   again.\u00a0 Here are our choices this time....\u00a0...The integral is now,...\u00a0...Now, at this point it looks like we\u2019re just running in   circles.\u00a0 However, notice that we now   have the same integral on both sides and on the right side it\u2019s got a minus   sign in front of it.\u00a0 This means that   we can add the integral to both sides to get,...\u00a0...All we need to do now is divide by 2 and we\u2019re done.\u00a0 The integral is,...\u00a0...Notice that after dividing by the two we add in the   constant of integration at that point....\u00a0...This idea of integrating until you get the same integral on both sides of the equal sign and then simply solving for the integral is kind of nice to remember.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t show up all that often, but when it does it may be the only way to actually do the integral....\u00a0...We\u2019ve got one more example to do.\u00a0 As we will see some problems could require us to do integration by parts numerous times and there is a short hand method that will allow us to do multiple applications of integration by parts quickly and easily....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....We start off by choosing ... and ... as we always   would.\u00a0 However, instead of computing ... and ... we put these into the following table.\u00a0 We then differentiate down the column   corresponding to ... until we hit   zero.\u00a0 In the column corresponding to ... we integrate once for each entry in   the first column.\u00a0 There is also a   third column which we will explain in a bit and it always starts with a \u201c+\u201d   and then alternates signs as shown....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, multiply along the diagonals shown in the table.\u00a0 In front of each product put the sign in   the third column that corresponds to the \u201c...\u201d   term for that product.\u00a0 In this case   this would give,...\u00a0...We\u2019ve got the integral.\u00a0   This is much easier than writing down all the various ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s that we\u2019d have to do otherwise....\u00a0...So, in this section we\u2019ve seen how to do integration by parts.\u00a0 In your later math classes this is liable to be one of the more frequent integration techniques that you\u2019ll encounter.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It is important to not get too locked into patterns that you may think you\u2019ve seen.\u00a0 In most cases any pattern that you think you\u2019ve seen can (and will be) violated at some point in time.\u00a0 Be careful!...\u00a0...Also, don\u2019t forget the shorthand method for multiple applications of integration by parts problems.\u00a0 It can save you a fair amount of work on occasion.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/IntegrationByParts.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "As we have done in the last couple of sections, let\u2019s start off with a couple of integrals that we should already be able to do with a standard substitution....\u00a0...Both of these used the substitution ...\u00a0and at this point should be pretty easy for you to do.\u00a0 However, let\u2019s take a look at the following integral....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....In this case the substitution ...\u00a0will not work and so we\u2019re going to have to   do something different for this integral.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...It would be nice if we could get rid of the square root   somehow.\u00a0 The following substitution   will do that for us....Do not worry about where this came from at this   point.\u00a0 As we work the problem you will   see that it works and that if we have a similar type of square root in the   problem we can always use a similar substitution....\u00a0...Before we actually do the substitution however let\u2019s   verify the claim that this will allow us to get rid of the square root....\u00a0...To get rid of the square root all we need to do is recall   the relationship,...\u00a0...Using this fact the square root becomes,...\u00a0...Note the presence of the absolute value bars there.\u00a0 These are important.\u00a0 Recall that...\u00a0...There should always be absolute value bars at this   stage.\u00a0 If we knew that ...\u00a0was always positive or always negative we   could eliminate the absolute value bars using,...\u00a0...Without limits we won\u2019t be able to determine if ...\u00a0is positive or negative, however, we will   need to eliminate them in order to do the integral.\u00a0 Therefore, since we are doing an indefinite   integral we will assume that ...\u00a0will be positive and so we can drop the   absolute value bars.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...So, we were able to eliminate the square root using this   substitution.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now do the   substitution and see what we get.\u00a0 In   doing the substitution don\u2019t forget that we'll also need to substitute for the   ....\u00a0   This is easy enough to get from the substitution....\u00a0...Using this substitution the integral becomes,...\u00a0...With this substitution we were able to reduce the given   integral to an integral involving trig functions and we saw how to do these   problems in the previous ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s finish the integral....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got an answer for the integral.\u00a0 Unfortunately the answer isn\u2019t given in ...\u2019s as it should be.\u00a0 So, we need to write our answer in terms of   ....\u00a0   We can do this with some right triangle trig.\u00a0 From our original substitution we have,...\u00a0...This gives the following right triangle....From this we can see that,...\u00a0...We can deal with the ...\u00a0in one of any variety of ways.\u00a0 From our substitution we can see that,...\u00a0...While this is a perfectly acceptable method of dealing   with the ...\u00a0we can use any of the possible six inverse   trig functions and since sine and cosine are the two trig functions most   people are familiar with we will usually use the inverse sine or inverse   cosine.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll use the   inverse cosine....\u00a0...So, with all of this the integral becomes,...We now have the answer back in terms of .......\u00a0...Wow!\u00a0 That was a lot of work.\u00a0 Most of these won\u2019t take as long to work however.\u00a0 This first one needed lot\u2019s of explanation since it was the first one.\u00a0 The remaining examples won\u2019t need quite as much explanation and so won\u2019t take as long to work....\u00a0...However, before we move onto more problems let\u2019s first address the issue of definite integrals and how the process differs in these cases....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....The limits here won\u2019t change the substitution so that will   remain the same....Using this substitution the square root still reduces down   to,...\u00a0...However, unlike the previous example we can\u2019t just drop   the absolute value bars.\u00a0 In this case   we\u2019ve got limits on the integral and so we can use the limits as well as the   substitution to determine the range of ...\u00a0that we\u2019re in.\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve got that we can determine how to   drop the absolute value bars....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the limits of .......\u00a0...So, if we are in the range ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is in the range of ...\u00a0and in this range of ...\u2019s tangent is positive and so we can   just drop the absolute value bars.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s do the substitution.\u00a0   Note that the work is identical to the previous example and so most of   it is left out.\u00a0 We\u2019ll pick up at the   final integral and then do the substitution....Note that because of the limits we didn\u2019t need to resort   to a right triangle to complete the problem....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a different set of limits for this integral....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....Again, the substitution and square root are the same as   the first two examples....\u00a0...Let\u2019s next see the limits ...\u00a0for this problem....Note that in determining the value of ...\u00a0we used the smallest positive value.\u00a0 Now for this range of ...\u2019s we have ...\u00a0and in this range of ...\u00a0tangent is negative and so in this case we   can drop the absolute value bars, but will need to add in a minus sign upon   doing so.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...So, the only change this will make in the integration   process is to put a minus sign in front of the integral.\u00a0 The integral is then,...\u00a0...In the last two examples we saw that we have to be very careful with definite integrals.\u00a0 We need to make sure that we determine the limits on ...\u00a0and whether or not this will mean that we can drop the absolute value bars or if we need to add in a minus sign when we drop them....\u00a0...Before moving on to the next example let\u2019s get the general form for the substitution that we used in the previous set of examples....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a new and different type of example....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....Now, the square root in this problem looks to be (almost)   the same as the previous ones so let\u2019s try the same type of substitution and   see if it will work here as well....\u00a0...Using this substitution the square root becomes,...\u00a0...So using this substitution we will end up with a negative   quantity (the tangent squared is always positive of course) under the square   root and this will be trouble.\u00a0 Using   this substitution will give complex values and we don\u2019t want that.\u00a0 So, using secant for the substitution won\u2019t   work....\u00a0...However, the following substitution (and differential)   will work....\u00a0...With this substitution the square root is,...\u00a0...We were able to drop the absolute value bars because we   are doing an indefinite integral and so we\u2019ll assume that everything is   positive....\u00a0...The integral is now,...\u00a0...In the previous section we saw how to deal with integrals   in which the exponent on the secant was even and since cosecants behave an   awful lot like secants we should be able to do something similar with this....\u00a0...Here is the integral....\u00a0...Now we need to go back to ...\u2019s using a right triangle.\u00a0   Here is the right triangle for this problem and trig functions for   this problem....The integral is then,...\u00a0...Here\u2019s the general form for this type of square root....\u00a0...There is one final case that we need to look at.\u00a0 The next integral will also contain something that we need to make sure we can deal with....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....First, notice that there really is a square root in this   problem even though it isn\u2019t explicitly written out.\u00a0 To see the root let\u2019s rewrite things a   little....\u00a0...This square root is not in the form we saw in the previous   examples.\u00a0 Here we will use the   substitution for this root....\u00a0...With this substitution the denominator becomes,...\u00a0...Now, because we have limits we\u2019ll need to convert them to ...\u00a0so we can determine how to drop the absolute   value bars....In this range of ...\u00a0secant is positive and so we can drop the   absolute value bars....\u00a0...Here is the integral,...\u00a0...There are several ways to proceed from this point.\u00a0 Normally with an odd exponent on the   tangent we would strip one of them out and convert to secants.\u00a0 However, that would require that we also   have a secant in the numerator which we don\u2019t have.\u00a0 Therefore, it seems like the best way to do   this one would be to convert the integrand to sines and cosines....\u00a0...We can now use the substitution ...\u00a0and we might as well convert the limits as   well....The integral is then,...\u00a0...The general form for this final type of square root is...\u00a0...\u00a0...We have a couple of final examples to work in this section.\u00a0 Not all trig substitutions will just jump right out at us.\u00a0 Sometimes we need to do a little work on the integrand first to get it into the correct form and that is the point of the remaining examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....In this case the quantity under the root doesn\u2019t obviously   fit into any of the cases we looked at above and in fact isn\u2019t in the any of   the forms we saw in the previous examples.\u00a0   Note however that if we complete the square on the quadratic we can   make it look somewhat like the above integrals....\u00a0...Remember that completing the square requires a coefficient   of one in front of the ....\u00a0 Once we have that we take half the   coefficient of the ..., square it,   and then add and subtract it to the quantity.\u00a0   Here is the completing the square for this problem....\u00a0...So, the root becomes,...\u00a0...This looks like a secant substitution except we don\u2019t just   have an ... that is squared.\u00a0 That is okay, it will work the same way....\u00a0...Using this substitution the root reduces to,...\u00a0...Note we could drop the absolute value bars since we are   doing an indefinite integral.\u00a0 Here is   the integral....\u00a0...And here is the right triangle for this problem....The integral is then,...\u00a0...Evaluate   the following integral....\u00a0...This doesn\u2019t look to be anything like the other problems   in this section.\u00a0 However it is.\u00a0 To see this we first need to notice that,...With this we can use the following substitution....Remember that to compute the differential all we do is   differentiate both sides and then tack on ...   or ...\u00a0onto the appropriate side....\u00a0...With this substitution the square root becomes,...\u00a0...Again, we can drop the absolute value bars because we are   doing an indefinite integral.\u00a0 Here\u2019s   the integral....\u00a0...Here is the right triangle for this integral....\u00a0...The integral is then,...\u00a0...So, as we\u2019ve seen in the final two examples in this section some integrals that look nothing like the first few examples can in fact be turned into a trig substitution problem with a little work....\u00a0...Before leaving this section let\u2019s summarize all three cases in one place.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/TrigSubstitutions.aspx", "media":

seen and is the more important of the two.\u00a0 As with functions of single variables partial derivatives represent the rates of change of the functions as the variables change.\u00a0 As we saw in the previous section, ...\u00a0represents the rate of change of the function ...\u00a0as we change ... and hold ... fixed while ...\u00a0represents the rate of change of ...\u00a0as we change ... and

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we will take a look at limits involving functions of more than one variable.\u00a0 In fact, we will concentrate mostly on limits of functions of two variables, but the ideas can be extended out to functions with more than two variables....\u00a0...Before getting into this let\u2019s briefly recall how limits of functions of one variable work.\u00a0 We say that,...provided,...\u00a0...Also, recall that,...is a right hand limit and requires us to only look at values of ... that are greater than ....\u00a0 Likewise,...is a left

letting ...) from both sides....\u00a0...Now, notice that in this case there are only two paths that we can take as we move in towards ....\u00a0 We can either move in from the left or we can move in from the right.\u00a0 Then in order for the limit of a function of one variable to exist the function must be approaching the same value as we take each of these paths in towards .......\u00a0...With functions of two variables we will have to do something similar, except this time there is (potentially) going to be a lot more work involved.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first address the notation and get a feel for just what we\u2019re going to be asking for in these kinds of limits....\u00a0...We will be asking to take the limit of the function ...\u00a0as ... approaches ... and as ... approaches ....\u00a0 This can be written in several ways.\u00a0 Here are a couple of the more standard notations....\u00a0...\u00a0...We will use the second notation more often than not in this course.\u00a0 The second notation is also a little more helpful in illustrating what we are really doing here when we are taking a limit.\u00a0 In taking a limit of a function of two variables we are really asking what the value of ...\u00a0is doing as we move the point ...\u00a0in closer and closer to the point ...\u00a0without actually letting it be .......\u00a0...Just like with limits of functions of one variable, in order for this limit to exist, the function must be approaching the same value regardless of the path that we take as we move in towards ....\u00a0 The problem that we are immediately faced with is that there are literally an infinite number of paths that we can take as we move in towards ....\u00a0 Here are a few examples of paths that we could take....\u00a0...We put in a couple of straight line paths as well as a couple of \u201cstranger\u201d paths that aren\u2019t straight line paths.\u00a0 Also, we only included 6 paths here and as you can see simply by varying the slope of the straight line paths there are an infinite number of these and then we would need to consider paths that aren\u2019t straight line paths....\u00a0...In other words, to show that a limit exists we would technically need to check an infinite number of paths and verify that the function is approaching the same value regardless of the path we are using to approach the point....\u00a0...Luckily for us however we can use one of the main ideas from Calculus I limits to help us take limits here....\u00a0...A function ...\u00a0is ...   at the point ...\u00a0if,...\u00a0...From a graphical standpoint this definition means the same thing as it did when we first saw ... in Calculus I.\u00a0 A function will be continuous at a point if the graph doesn\u2019t have any holes or breaks at that point....\u00a0...How can this help us take limits?\u00a0 Well, just as in Calculus I, if you know that a function is continuous at ...\u00a0then you also know that ...must be true.\u00a0 So, if we know that a function is continuous at a point then all we need to do to take the limit of the function at that point is to plug the point into the function....\u00a0...All the standard functions that we know to be continuous are still continuous even if we are plugging in more than one variable now.\u00a0 We just need to watch out for division by zero, square roots of negative numbers, logarithms of zero or negative numbers, ...\u00a0...Note that the idea about paths is one that we shouldn\u2019t forget since it is a nice way to determine if a limit doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 If we can find two paths upon which the function approaches different values as we get near the point then we will know that the limit doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Determine   if the following limits exist or not.\u00a0   If they do exist give the value of the limit....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Okay, in this case the function is continuous at the point   in question and so all we need to do is plug in the values and we\u2019re done....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case the function will not be continuous along the   line ...\u00a0since we will get division by zero when this   is true.\u00a0 However, for this problem   that is not something that we will need to worry about since the point that   we are taking the limit at isn\u2019t on this line....\u00a0...Therefore, all that we need to do is plug in the point   since the function is continuous at this point.... ...\u00a0...Now, in this case the function is not continuous at the   point in question and so we can\u2019t just plug in the point.\u00a0 So, since the function is not continuous at   the point there is at least a chance that the limit doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 If we could find two different paths to approach   the point that gave different values for the limit then we would know that   the limit didn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 Two of the   more common paths to check are the ...   and ...-axis so let\u2019s try those....\u00a0...Before actually doing this we need to address just what   exactly do we mean when we say that we are going to approach a point along a   path.\u00a0 When we approach a point along a   path we will do this by either fixing ...   or ... or by relating ... and ... through some function.\u00a0   In this way we can reduce the limit to just a limit involving a single   variable which we know how to do from Calculus I....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s see what happens along the\u00a0 ...-axis.\u00a0 If we are going to approach ...\u00a0along the ...-axis we can take advantage of the fact that that along the ...-axis we know that ....\u00a0 This means that, along the ...-axis, we will plug in ...\u00a0into the function and then take the limit as   ... approaches zero....\u00a0...So, along the ...-axis   the function will approach zero as we move in towards the origin....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s try the ...-axis.\u00a0 Along this axis we have ...\u00a0and so the limit becomes,...\u00a0...So, the same limit along two paths.\u00a0 Don\u2019t misread this.\u00a0 This does NOT say that the limit exists and   has a value of zero.\u00a0 This only means   that the limit happens to have the same value along two paths....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a third fairly common path to take a   look at.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll move in   towards the origin along the path ....\u00a0 This is what we meant previously about   relating ... and ... through a function.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To do this we will replace all the ...\u2019s with ...\u2019s and then   let ... approach zero.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at this limit....\u00a0...So, a different value from the previous two paths and this   means that the limit can\u2019t possibly exist....\u00a0...Note that we can use this idea of moving in towards the   origin along a line with the more general path ...\u00a0if we need to....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Okay, with this last one we again have continuity problems   at the origin.\u00a0 So, again let\u2019s see if   we can find a couple of paths that give different values of the limit....\u00a0...First, we will use the path ....\u00a0 Along this path we have,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s try the path ....\u00a0 Along this path the limit becomes,...\u00a0...We now have two paths that give different values for the   limit and so the limit doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...As this limit has shown us we can, and often need, to use   paths other than lines.", "url":

So, before we get into finding the rate of change we need to get a couple of preliminary ideas taken care of first.\u00a0 The main idea that we need to look at is just how are we going to define the changing of ... and/or ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off by supposing that we wanted the rate of change of ... at a particular point, say ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s also suppose that both ... and ... are increasing and that, in this case, ... is increasing twice as fast as ... is increasing.\u00a0 So, as ... increases one unit of measure ... will increase two units of measure.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To help us see how we\u2019re going to define this change let\u2019s suppose that a particle is sitting at ...\u00a0and the particle will move in the direction given by the changing ... and ....\u00a0 Therefore, the particle will move off in a direction of increasing ... and ... and the ... coordinate of the point will increase twice as fast as the ... coordinate.\u00a0 Now that we\u2019re thinking of this changing ... and ... as a direction of movement we can get a way of defining the change.\u00a0 We know from Calculus II that vectors can be used to define a direction and so the particle, at this point, can be said to be moving in the direction,...\u00a0...Since this vector can be used to define how a particle at a point is changing we can also use it describe how ... and/or ... is changing at a point.\u00a0 For our example we will say that we want the rate of change of ... in the direction of ....\u00a0 In this way we will know that ... is increasing twice as fast as ... is.\u00a0 There is still a small problem with this however.\u00a0 There are many vectors that point in the same direction.\u00a0 For instance all of the following vectors point in the same direction as .......\u00a0...We need a way to consistently find the rate of change of a function in a given direction.\u00a0 We will do this by insisting that the vector that defines the direction of change be a unit vector.\u00a0 Recall that a unit vector is a vector with length, or magnitude, of 1.\u00a0 This means that for the example that we started off thinking about we would want to use ...since this is the unit vector that points in the direction of change....\u00a0...For reference purposes recall that the magnitude or length of the vector ...\u00a0is given by,...For two dimensional vectors we drop the ... from the formula....\u00a0...Sometimes we will give the direction of changing ... and ... as an angle.\u00a0 For instance, we may say that we want the rate of change of ... in the direction of ....\u00a0 The unit vector that points in this direction is given by,...\u00a0...Okay, now that we know how to define the direction of changing ... and ... its time to start talking about finding the rate of change of ... in this direction.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off with the official definition....\u00a0...The rate of change of ...\u00a0in the direction of the unit vector ...\u00a0is called the ... and is denoted by ....\u00a0 The definition of the directional   derivative is,...\u00a0...So, the definition of the directional derivative is very similar to the definition of partial derivatives.\u00a0 However, in practice this can be a very difficult limit to compute so we need an easier way of taking directional derivatives.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually fairly simple to derive an equivalent formula for taking directional derivatives....\u00a0...To see how we can do this let\u2019s define a new function of a single variable,...where ..., ..., ..., and ... are some fixed numbers.\u00a0 Note that this really is a function of a single variable now since ... is the only letter that is not representing a fixed number....\u00a0...Then by the definition of the derivative for functions of a single variable we have,...and the derivative at ...\u00a0is given by,...\u00a0...If we now substitute in for ...\u00a0we get,...\u00a0...So, it looks like we have the following relationship....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s look at this from another perspective.\u00a0 Let\u2019s rewrite ...\u00a0as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We can now use the chain rule from the previous section to compute,...So, from the chain rule we get the following relationship....\u00a0...\u00a0...If we now take ...\u00a0we will get that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0(from how we defined ... and ... above) and plug these into ... we get,...\u00a0...Now, simply equate ... and ... to get that,...\u00a0...If we now go back to allowing ... and ... to be any number we get the following formula for computing directional derivatives....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is much simpler than the limit definition.\u00a0 Also note that this definition assumed that we were working with functions of two variables.\u00a0 There are similar formulas that can be derived by the same type of argument for functions with more than two variables.\u00a0 For instance, the directional derivative of ...\u00a0in the direction of the unit vector ...\u00a0is given by,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples....\u00a0...Find   each of the directional derivatives....\u00a0where

...\u00a0in the direction of ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll first find ...\u00a0and then use this a formula for finding ....\u00a0 The unit vector giving the direction is,...\u00a0...So, the directional derivative is,...\u00a0...Now, plugging in the point in question gives,...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case let\u2019s first check to see if the direction   vector is a unit vector or not and if it isn\u2019t convert it into one.\u00a0 To do this all we need to do is compute its   magnitude....So, it\u2019s not a unit vector.\u00a0 Recall that we can convert any vector into   a unit vector that points in the same direction by dividing the vector by its   magnitude.\u00a0 So, the unit vector that we   need is,...\u00a0...The directional derivative is then,...\u00a0...There is another form of the formula that we used to get the directional derivative that is a little nicer and somewhat more compact.\u00a0 It is also a much more general formula that will encompass both of the formulas above....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the second one and notice that we can write it as follows,...\u00a0...In other words we can write the directional derivative as a dot product and notice that the second vector is nothing more than the unit vector ...\u00a0that gives the direction of change.\u00a0 Also, if we had used the version for functions of two variables the third component wouldn\u2019t be there, but other than that the formula would be the same....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s give a name and notation to the first vector in the dot product since this vector will show up fairly regularly throughout this course (and in other courses).\u00a0 The ... or ... is defined to be,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Or, if we want to use the standard basis vectors the gradient is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The definition is only shown for functions of two or three variables, however there is a natural extension to functions of any number of variables that we\u2019d like....\u00a0...With the definition of the gradient we can now say that the directional derivative is given by,...where we will no longer show the variable and use this formula for any number of variables.\u00a0 Note as well that we will sometimes use the following notation,...\u00a0...\u00a0...where ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0as needed.\u00a0 This notation will be used when we want to note the variables in some way, but don\u2019t really want to restrict ourselves to a particular number of variables.\u00a0 In other words, ...\u00a0will be used to represent as many variables as we need in the formula and we will most often use this notation when we are already using vectors or vector notation in the problem/formula....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples using this formula of the directional derivative....\u00a0...Find   each of the directional derivative....\u00a0for ...\u00a0in the direction of ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0at ...\u00a0in the direction of ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ....\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s first compute the gradient for this function....Also, as we saw earlier in this section the unit vector   for this direction is,...\u00a0...The directional derivative is then,...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case are asking for the directional derivative at   a particular point.\u00a0 To do this we will   first compute the gradient, evaluate it at the point in question and then do   the dot product.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s get the   gradient....\u00a0...Next, we need the unit vector for the direction,...\u00a0...Finally, the directional derivative at the point in   question is,...\u00a0...Before proceeding let\u2019s note that the first order partial derivatives that we were looking at in the majority of the section can be thought of as special cases of the directional derivatives.\u00a0 For instance, ...\u00a0can be thought of as the directional derivative of ... in the direction of ...\u00a0or ..., depending on the number of variables that we\u2019re working with.\u00a0 The same can be done for ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0...We will close out this section with a couple of nice facts about the gradient vector.\u00a0 The first tells us how to determine the maximum rate of change of a function at a point and the direction that we need to move in order to achieve that maximum rate of change....\u00a0...The maximum value of ...\u00a0(and hence then the maximum rate of change   of the function ...) is given by ...\u00a0\u00a0and will occur in the direction given by .......\u00a0...This is a   really simple proof.\u00a0 First, if we   start with the dot product form ...\u00a0and use a nice ... about dot   products as well as the fact that ...\u00a0is a unit vector we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...where ...\u00a0is the angle between the gradient and .......\u00a0...Now the largest   possible value of ...\u00a0is 1 which occurs at ....\u00a0 Therefore the maximum value of ...\u00a0is ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, the maximum value occurs when the   angle between the gradient and ...\u00a0is zero, or in other words when ...\u00a0is pointing in the same direction as the   gradient, ....

...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example....\u00a0...Suppose   that the height of a hill above sea level is given by ....\u00a0 If you are at the point ...\u00a0in what direction is the elevation changing   fastest?\u00a0 What is the maximum rate of   change of the elevation at this point?\u00a0   ...\u00a0...First, you will hopefully recall from the ... section that this is an   elliptic paraboloid that opens downward.\u00a0   So even though most hills aren\u2019t this symmetrical it will at least be   vaguely hill shaped and so the question makes at least a little sense. ...\u00a0...Now on to the problem. \u00a0There are a couple of questions to answer   here, but using the theorem makes answering them very simple.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first need the gradient vector....\u00a0...The maximum rate of change of the elevation will then   occur in the direction of...\u00a0...The maximum rate of change of the elevation at this point   is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Before leaving this example let\u2019s note that we\u2019re at the   point ...\u00a0and the direction of greatest rate of change of   the elevation at this point is given by the vector ....\u00a0 Since both of the components are negative   it looks like the direction of maximum rate of change points up the hill   towards the center rather than away from the hill.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The second fact about the gradient vector that we need to give in this section will be very convenient in some later sections....\u00a0...The gradient vector ...\u00a0is orthogonal (or perpendicular) to the ... ...\u00a0at the point ....\u00a0 Likewise, the gradient vector ...\u00a0is orthogonal to the level surface ...\u00a0at the point ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019re going to   do the proof for the ...case.\u00a0   The proof for the ...\u00a0case is identical.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also need some notation out of the   way to make life easier for us let\u2019s let ...   be the level surface given by ...\u00a0and let ....\u00a0 Note as well that ... will be on .......\u00a0...Now, let ... be any curve on ... that contains ....\u00a0 Let ...\u00a0be the vector equation for ... and suppose that ...\u00a0be the value of ... such that ....\u00a0 In other words, ...\u00a0be the value of ... that gives .......\u00a0...Because ... lies on ... we know that points on ...   must satisfy the equation for ....\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We\u2019ve been using the standard chain rule for functions of one variable throughout the last couple of sections.\u00a0 It\u2019s now time to extend the chain rule out to more complicated situations.\u00a0 Before we actually do that let\u2019s first review the notation for the chain rule for functions of one variable....\u00a0...The notation that\u2019s probably familiar to most people is the following....\u00a0...There is an alternate notation however that while probably not used much in Calculus I is more convenient at this point because it will match up with the notation that we are going to be using in this section.\u00a0 Here it is....\u00a0...Notice that the derivative ...\u00a0really does make sense here since if we were to plug in for ... then ... really would be a function of ....\u00a0 One way to remember this form of the chain rule is to note that if we think of the two derivatives on the right side as fractions the ...\u2019s will cancel to get the same derivative on both sides....\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve got that out of the way let\u2019s move into the more complicated chain rules that we are liable to run across in this course....\u00a0...As with many topics in multivariable calculus, there are in fact many different formulas depending upon the number of variables that we\u2019re dealing with.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s start this discussion off with a function of two variables, ....\u00a0 From this point there are still many different possibilities that we can look at.\u00a0 We will be looking at two distinct cases prior to generalizing the whole idea out....\u00a0... ..., ..., ...\u00a0and compute .......This case is analogous to the standard chain rule from Calculus I that we looked at above.\u00a0 In this case we are going to compute an ordinary derivative since ... really would be a function of ... only if we were to substitute in for ... and .......\u00a0...The chain rule for this case is,...\u00a0...So, basically what we\u2019re doing here is differentiating ... with respect to each variable in it and then multiplying each of these by the derivative of that variable with respect to ....\u00a0 The final step is to then add all this up....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Compute   ...\u00a0for each of the following....,   ...,   ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...,   ...,   ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...,   ...,   ...\u00a0...There really isn\u2019t all that much to do here other than   using the formula....So, technically we\u2019ve computed the derivative.\u00a0 However, we should probably go ahead and   substitute in for ... and ... as well at this point since we\u2019ve   already got ...\u2019s in the   derivative.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that in this case it might actually have been easier   to just substitute in for ... and ... in the original function and just   compute the derivative as we normally would.\u00a0   For comparison's sake let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...The same result for less work.\u00a0 Note however, that often it will actually   be more work to do the substitution first.... ...,   ...,   ...\u00a0...Okay, in this case it would almost definitely be more work   to do the substitution first so we\u2019ll use the chain rule first and then   substitute....\u00a0...Note that sometimes, because of the significant mess of   the final answer, we will only simplify the first step a little and leave the   answer in terms of ..., ..., and ....\u00a0 This is dependent upon   the situation, class and instructor however and for this class we will pretty   much always be substituting in for ...   and .......\u00a0...Now, there is a special case that we should take a quick look at before moving on to the next case.\u00a0 Let\u2019s suppose that we have the following situation,...\u00a0...In this case the chain rule for ...\u00a0becomes,...\u00a0...In the first term we are using the fact that,...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example....\u00a0...Compute   ...\u00a0for ...,   ...We\u2019ll just plug into the formula....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at the second case....\u00a0... ..., ..., ...\u00a0and compute ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...In this case if we were to substitute in for ... and ... we would get that ... is a function of ... and ... and so it makes sense that we would be computing partial derivatives here and that there would be two of them....\u00a0...Here is the chain rule for both of these cases....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, not surprisingly, these are very similar to the first case that we looked at.\u00a0 Here is a quick example of this kind of chain rule....\u00a0...Find   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0for ...,   ...,\u00a0 .......Here is the chain rule for .......\u00a0...Now the chain rule for .......\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve seen a couple of cases for the chain rule let\u2019s see the general version of the chain rule....\u00a0...Suppose that ... is a function of ... variables, ..., and that each of these variables are in turn functions of ... variables, ....\u00a0 Then for any variable ..., ...\u00a0we have the following,...\u00a0...Wow.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot to remember.\u00a0 There is actually an easier way to construct all the chain rules that we\u2019ve discussed in the section or will look at in later examples.\u00a0 We can build up a ... that will give us the chain rule for any situation.\u00a0 To see how these work let\u2019s go back and take a look at the chain rule for ...\u00a0given that ..., ..., ....\u00a0 We already know what this is, but it may help to illustrate the tree diagram if we already know the answer.\u00a0 For reference here is the chain rule for this case,...\u00a0...Here is the tree diagram for this case....\u00a0...We start at the top with the function itself and the branch out from that point.\u00a0 The first set of branches is for the variables in the function.\u00a0 From each of these endpoints we put down a further set of branches that gives the variables that both ... and ... are a function of.\u00a0 We connect each letter with a line and each line represents a partial derivative as shown.\u00a0 Note that the letter in the numerator of the partial derivative is the upper \u201cnode\u201d of the tree and the letter in the denominator of the partial derivative is the lower \u201cnode\u201d of the tree....\u00a0...To use this to get the chain rule we start at the bottom and for each branch that ends with the variable we want to take the derivative with respect to (... in this case) we move up the tree until we hit the top multiplying the derivatives that we see along that set of branches.\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve done this for each branch that ends at ..., we then add the results up to get the chain rule for that given situation....\u00a0...Note that we don\u2019t usually put the derivatives in the tree.\u00a0 They are always an assumed part of the tree....\u00a0...Let\u2019s write down some chain rules....\u00a0...Use   a tree diagram to write down the chain rule for the given derivatives....\u00a0for ...,   ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0for ...,   ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0... ...\u00a0for ...,   ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ll first need the tree diagram so let\u2019s get that....\u00a0...\u00a0...From this is looks like the chain rule for this case   should be,...which is really just a natural extension to the two   variable case that we saw above....\u00a0... ...\u00a0for ...,   ...,   ...,   and ...\u00a0...Here is the tree diagram for this situation....\u00a0...From this it looks like the derivative will be,...\u00a0...So, provided we can write down the tree diagram, and these aren\u2019t usually too bad to write down, we can do the chain rule for any set up that we might run across....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now seen how to take first derivatives of these more complicated situations, but what about higher order derivatives?\u00a0 How do we do those?\u00a0 It\u2019s probably easiest to see how to deal with these with an example....\u00a0...Compute   ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0if ...\u00a0and .......We will need the first derivative before we can even think   about finding the second derivative so let\u2019s get that.\u00a0 This situation falls into the second case   that we looked at above so we don\u2019t need a new tree diagram.\u00a0 Here is the first derivative....\u00a0...Okay, now we know that the second derivative is,...\u00a0...The issue here is to correctly deal with this   derivative.\u00a0 Since the two first order   derivatives, ...\u00a0and ...,   are both functions of ... and ... which are in turn functions of ... and ...\u00a0both of these terms are products.\u00a0 So, the using the product rule gives the   following,...\u00a0...We now need to determine what ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will be.\u00a0   These are both chain rule problems again since both of the derivatives   are functions of ... and ... and we want to take the derivative   with respect to .......\u00a0...Before we do these let\u2019s rewrite the first chain rule that   we did above a little....\u00a0...Note that all we\u2019ve done is change the notation for the   derivative a little.\u00a0 With the first   chain rule written in this way we can think of ...   as a formula for differentiating any function of ... and ... with respect to   ...\u00a0provided we have ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This however is exactly what we need to do the two new   derivatives we need above.\u00a0 Both of the   first order partial derivatives, ...\u00a0and ...,   are functions of ... and ... and ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0so we can use ...   to compute these derivatives.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To do this we\u2019ll simply replace all the ... \u2019s in ...   with the first order partial derivative that we want to differentiate.\u00a0 At that point all we need to do is a little   notational work and we\u2019ll get the formula that we\u2019re after....\u00a0...Here is the use of ...   to compute .......\u00a0...Here is the computation for .......\u00a0...\u00a0...The final step is to plug these back into the second   derivative and do some simplifying....\u00a0...It\u2019s long and fairly messy but there it is....\u00a0...The final topic in this section is a revisiting of implicit differentiation.\u00a0 With these forms of the chain rule implicit differentiation actually becomes a fairly simple process.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start out with the ... that we saw in a Calculus I course....\u00a0...We will start with a function in the form ...\u00a0(if it\u2019s not in this form simply move everything to one side of the equal sign to get it into this form) where ....\u00a0 In a Calculus I course we were then asked to compute ...\u00a0and this was often a fairly messy process.\u00a0 Using the chain rule from this section however we can get a nice simple formula for doing this.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start by differentiating both sides with respect to ....\u00a0 This will mean using the chain rule on the left side and the right side will, of course, differentiate to zero.\u00a0 Here are the results of that....\u00a0...As shown, all we need to do next is solve for ...\u00a0and we\u2019ve now got a very nice formula to use for implicit differentiation.\u00a0 Note as well that in order to simplify the formula we switched back to using the subscript notation for the derivatives....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check out a quick example....\u00a0...Find   ...\u00a0for .......\u00a0...The first step is to get a zero on one side of the equal   sign and that\u2019s easy enough to do....Now, the function on the left is ...\u00a0in our formula so all we need to do is use   the formula to find the derivative....\u00a0...There we go.\u00a0 It   would have taken much longer to do this using the old Calculus I way of doing   this....\u00a0...We can also do something similar to handle the types of implicit differentiation problems involving partial derivatives like those we saw when we first introduced partial derivatives.\u00a0 In these cases we will start off with a function in the form ...\u00a0and assume that ...\u00a0and we want to find ...\u00a0and/or .... ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start by trying to find ....\u00a0 We will differentiate both sides with respect to ... and we\u2019ll need to remember that we\u2019re going to be treating ... as a constant.\u00a0 Also, the left side will require the chain rule.\u00a0 Here is this derivative....\u00a0...Now, we have the following,...The first is because we are just differentiating ... with respect to ... and we know that is 1.\u00a0 The second is because we are treating the ... as a constant and so it will differentiate to zero. ...\u00a0...Plugging these in and solving for ...\u00a0gives,...\u00a0...A similar argument can be used to show that,...\u00a0...As with the one variable case we switched to the subscripting notation for derivatives to simplify the formulas.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example of this....\u00a0...Find   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0for .......This was one of the functions that we used the old   implicit differentiation on back in the ...   section.\u00a0 You might want to go back and   see the difference between the two....\u00a0...First let\u2019s get everything on one side....Now, the function on the left is ...\u00a0and so all that we need to do is use the   formulas developed above to find the derivatives....\u00a0...If you go back and compare these answers to those that we   found the first time around you will notice that they might appear to be   different.\u00a0 However, if you take into   account the minus sign that sits in the front of our answers here you will   see that they are in fact the same.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/ChainRule.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus III - Chain Rule", "subject": "math"}},

(which is also the same ... as in polar/cylindrical coordinates).\u00a0 There are no restrictions on .......\u00a0...Finally there is ....\u00a0 This is the angle between the positive ...-axis and the line from the origin to the point.\u00a0 We will require .......\u00a0...In summary, ...\u00a0is the distance from the origin to the point, ...\u00a0is the angle that we need to rotate down from the positive ...axis to get to the point and ...\u00a0is how much we need to rotate around the ...-axis to get to the point....\u00a0...We should first derive some conversion formulas.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first start with a point in spherical coordinates and ask what the cylindrical coordinates of the point are.\u00a0 So, we know ...\u00a0and want to find ....\u00a0 Of course we really only need to find ... and ... since ...\u00a0is the same in both coordinate systems....\u00a0...We will be able to do all of our work by looking at the right triangle shown above in our sketch.\u00a0 With a little geometry we see that the angle between ... and ...\u00a0is ...\u00a0and so we can see that,...and these are exactly the formulas that we were looking for.\u00a0\u00a0 So, given a point in spherical coordinates the cylindrical coordinates of the point will be,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note as well that,...Or,...\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s find the Cartesian coordinates of the same point.\u00a0 To do this we\u2019ll start with the cylindrical conversion formulas from the .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Now all that we need to do is use the formulas from above for ... and ... to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Also note that since we know that ...\u00a0we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Converting points from Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates into spherical coordinates is usually done with the same conversion formulas.\u00a0 To see how this is done let\u2019s work an example of each....\u00a0...Perform   each of the following conversions....Convert   the point ...\u00a0from cylindrical to spherical coordinates. ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Convert   the point ...\u00a0from Cartesian to spherical coordinates....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll start by acknowledging that ...\u00a0is the same in both coordinate systems and   so we don\u2019t need to do anything with that....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s find .......\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s get ....\u00a0 To do this we can use either the conversion   for ... or ....\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ll use the   conversion for .......Notice that there are many possible values of ...\u00a0that will give ...,   however, we have restricted ...\u00a0to the range ...\u00a0and so this is the only possible value in   that range....\u00a0...So, the spherical coordinates of this point will are .......\u00a0... ...\u00a0...The first thing that we\u2019ll do here is find .......\u00a0...Now we\u2019ll need to find ....\u00a0 We can do this using the conversion for .......As with the last parts this will be the only possible ...\u00a0in the range allowed....\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s find ....\u00a0 To do this we can use the conversion for ... or ....\u00a0 We will use the   conversion for ... in this case....\u00a0...Now, we actually have more possible choices for ...\u00a0but all of them will reduce down to one of   the two angles above since they will just be one of these two angles with one   or more complete rotations around the unit circle added on.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We will however, need to decide which one is the correct   angle since only one will be.\u00a0\u00a0 To do   this let\u2019s notice that, in two dimensions, the point with coordinates ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0lies in the second quadrant.\u00a0 This means that ...\u00a0must be angle that will put the point into   the second quadrant.\u00a0 Therefore, the   second angle, ...,   must be the correct one....\u00a0...The spherical coordinates of this point are then .......\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at some equations and identify the surfaces that they represent....\u00a0...Identify   the surface for each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are a couple of ways to think about this one.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, think about what this equation is saying.\u00a0 This equation says that, no matter what ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are, the distance from the origin must be   5.\u00a0 So, we can rotate as much as we   want away from the ...-axis and   around the ...-axis, but we must   always remain at a fixed distance from the origin.\u00a0 This is exactly what a sphere is.\u00a0 So, this is a sphere of radius 5 centered   at the origin....\u00a0...The other way to think about it is to just convert to   Cartesian coordinates....\u00a0...Sure enough a sphere of radius 5 centered at the origin....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this case there isn\u2019t an easy way to convert to   Cartesian coordinates so we\u2019ll just need to think about this one a   little.\u00a0 This equation says that no   matter how far away from the origin that we move and no matter how much we   rotate around the ...-axis the point   must always be at an angle of ...\u00a0from the ...-axis....\u00a0...This is exactly what happens in a cone.\u00a0 All of the points on a cone are a fixed   angle from the ...-axis.\u00a0 So, we have a cone whose points are all at   an angle of ...\u00a0from the ...-axis....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...As with the last part we won\u2019t be able to easily convert   to Cartesian coordinates here.\u00a0 In this   case no matter how far from the origin we get or how much we rotate down from   the positive ...-axis the points must   always form an angle of ...\u00a0with the ...-axis....\u00a0...Points in a vertical plane will do this.\u00a0 So, we have a vertical plane that forms an   angle of ...\u00a0with the positive ...-axis....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...\u00a0In this case we can   convert to Cartesian coordinates so let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 There are actually two ways to do this   conversion.\u00a0 We will look at both since   both will be used on occasion....\u00a0...In this solution method we will convert directly to   Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0 To do this we   will first need to square both sides of the equation....\u00a0...Now, for no apparent reason add ...\u00a0to both sides....\u00a0...Now we can convert to Cartesian coordinates....\u00a0...So, we have a cylinder of radius 2 centered on the ...-axis.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This solution method wasn\u2019t too bad, but it did require   some not so obvious steps to complete....\u00a0...This method is much shorter, but also involves something   that you may not see the first time around.\u00a0   In this case instead of going straight to Cartesian coordinates we\u2019ll   first convert to cylindrical coordinates....\u00a0...This won\u2019t always work, but in this case all we need to do   is recognize that ...\u00a0and we will get something we can   recognize.\u00a0 Using this we get,...\u00a0...At this point we know this is a cylinder (remember that   we\u2019re in three dimensions and so this isn\u2019t a circle!).\u00a0 However, let\u2019s go ahead and finish the   conversion process out....\u00a0...So, as we saw in the last part of the previous example it will ... be easier to convert equations in spherical coordinates into cylindrical coordinates before converting into Cartesian coordinates.\u00a0 This won\u2019t always be easier, but it can make some of the conversions quicker and easier....\u00a0...The last thing that we want to do in this section is generalize the first three parts of the previous example....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/SphericalCoords.aspx", "media": "text", "title":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Now that we have the brief discussion on limits out of the way we can proceed into taking derivatives of functions of more than one variable.\u00a0 Before we actually start taking derivatives of functions of more than one variable let\u2019s recall an important interpretation of derivatives of functions of one variable....\u00a0...Recall that given a function of one variable, ..., the derivative, ..., represents the rate of change of the function as ... changes.\u00a0 This is an important interpretation of derivatives and we are not going to want to lose it with functions of more than one variable.\u00a0 The problem with functions of more than one variable is that there is more than one variable.\u00a0 In other words, what do we do if we only want one of the variables to change, or if we want more than one of them to change?\u00a0 In fact, if we\u2019re going to allow more than one of the variables to change there are then going to be an infinite amount of ways for them to change.\u00a0 For instance, one variable could be changing faster than the other variable(s) in the function.\u00a0 Notice as well that it will be completely possible for the function to be changing differently depending on how we allow one or more of the variables to change....\u00a0...We will need to develop ways, and notations, for dealing with all of these cases.\u00a0 In this section we are going to concentrate exclusively on only changing one of the variables at a time, while the remaining variable(s) are held fixed.\u00a0 We will deal with allowing multiple variables to change in a later .......\u00a0...Because we are going to only allow one of the variables to change taking the derivative will now become a fairly simple process.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off this discussion with a fairly simple function....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the function ...\u00a0and let\u2019s determine the rate at which the function is changing at a point, ..., if we hold ... fixed and allow ... to vary and if we hold ... fixed and allow ... to vary....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start by looking at the case of holding ... fixed and allowing ... to vary.\u00a0 Since we are interested in the rate of change of the function at ...\u00a0and are holding ... fixed this means that we are going to always have ...\u00a0(if we didn\u2019t have this then eventually ... would have to change in order to get to the point\u2026).\u00a0 Doing this will give us a function involving only ...\u2019s and we can define a new function as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, this is a function of a single variable and at this point all that we are asking is to determine the rate of change of ...\u00a0at ....\u00a0 In other words, we want to compute ...\u00a0and since this is a function of a single variable we already know how to do that.\u00a0 Here is the rate of change of the function at ...\u00a0if we hold ... fixed and allow ... to vary....\u00a0...We will call ...\u00a0the ... of ...\u00a0with respect to ... at ...\u00a0and we will denote it in the following way,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s do it the other way.\u00a0 We will now hold ... fixed and allow ... to vary.\u00a0 We can do this in a similar way.\u00a0 Since we are holding ... fixed it must be fixed at ...\u00a0and so we can define a new function of ... and then differentiate this as we\u2019ve always done with functions of one variable....\u00a0...Here is the work for this,...\u00a0...In this case we call ...\u00a0the ... of ...\u00a0with respect to ... at ...\u00a0and we denote it as follows,...\u00a0...Note that these two partial derivatives are sometimes called the ....\u00a0 Just as with functions of one variable we can have derivatives of all orders.\u00a0 We will be looking at higher order derivatives in a later .......\u00a0...Note that the notation for partial derivatives is different than that for derivatives of functions of a single variable.\u00a0 With functions of a single variable we could denote the derivative with a single prime.\u00a0 However, with partial derivatives we will always need to remember the variable that we are differentiating with respect to and so we will subscript the variable that we differentiated with respect to.\u00a0 We will shortly be seeing some alternate notation for partial derivatives as well....\u00a0...Note as well that we usually don\u2019t use the ...\u00a0notation for partial derivatives.\u00a0 The more standard notation is to just continue to use ....\u00a0 So, the partial derivatives from above will more commonly be written as,...\u00a0...Now, as this quick example has shown taking derivatives of functions of more than one variable is done in pretty much the same manner as taking derivatives of a single variable.\u00a0 To compute ...\u00a0all we need to do is treat all the ...\u2019s as constants (or numbers) and then differentiate the ...\u2019s as we\u2019ve always done.\u00a0 Likewise, to compute ...\u00a0we will treat all the ...\u2019s as constants and then differentiate the ...\u2019s as we are used to doing....\u00a0...Before we work any examples let\u2019s get the formal definition of the partial derivative out of the way as well as some alternate notation....\u00a0...Since we can think of the two partial derivatives above as derivatives of single variable functions it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that the definition of each is very similar to the definition of the derivative for single variable functions.\u00a0 Here are the formal definitions of the two partial derivatives we looked at above....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a quick look at some of the possible alternate notations for partial derivatives.\u00a0 Given the function ...\u00a0the following are all equivalent notations,...\u00a0...For the fractional notation for the partial derivative notice the difference between the partial derivative and the ordinary derivative from single variable calculus....\u00a0...Okay, now let\u2019s work some examples.\u00a0 When working these examples always keep in mind that we need to pay very close attention to which variable we are differentiating with respect to.\u00a0 This is important because we are going to treat all other variables as constants and then proceed with the derivative as if it was a function of a single variable.\u00a0 If you can remember this you\u2019ll find that doing partial derivatives are not much more difficult that doing derivatives of functions of a single variable as we did in Calculus I....\u00a0...Find   all of the first order partial derivatives for the following functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s first take the derivative with respect to ... and remember that as we do so all   the ...\u2019s will be treated as   constants.\u00a0 The partial derivative with   respect to ... is,...\u00a0...Notice that the second and the third term differentiate to   zero in this case.\u00a0 It should be clear   why the third term differentiated to zero.\u00a0   It\u2019s a constant and we know that constants always differentiate to   zero.\u00a0 This is also the reason that the   second term differentiated to zero.\u00a0   Remember that since we are differentiating with respect to ... here we are going to treat all ...\u2019s as constants.\u00a0 That means that terms that only involve ...\u2019s will be treated as constants and   hence will differentiate to zero....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take the derivative with respect to ....\u00a0   In this case we treat all ...\u2019s   as constants and so the first term involves only ...\u2019s and so will differentiate to zero, just as the third term   will.\u00a0 Here is the partial derivative   with respect to .......\u00a0... ...With this function we\u2019ve got three first order derivatives   to compute.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do the partial   derivative with respect to ...   first.\u00a0 Since we are differentiating   with respect to ... we will treat all   ...\u2019s and all ...\u2019s as constants.\u00a0 This   means that the second and fourth terms will differentiate to zero since they   only involve ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s....\u00a0...This first term contains both ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s and so when   we differentiate with respect to ...   the ... will be thought of as a   multiplicative constant and so the first term will be differentiated just as   the third term will be differentiated....\u00a0...Here is the partial derivative with respect to .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s now differentiate with respect to ....\u00a0   In this case all ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s will be treated as constants.\u00a0 This means the third term will   differentiate to zero since it contains only ...\u2019s while the ...\u2019s in   the first term and the ...\u2019s in the second   term will be treated as multiplicative constants.\u00a0 Here is the derivative with respect to .......\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s get the derivative with respect to ....\u00a0   Since only one of the terms involve ...\u2019s this will be the only non-zero term in the derivative.\u00a0 Also, the ...\u2019s in that term will be treated as multiplicative   constants.\u00a0 Here is the derivative with   respect to .......\u00a0... ...With this one we\u2019ll not put in the detail of the first   two.\u00a0 Before taking the derivative   let\u2019s rewrite the function a little to help us with the differentiation   process....\u00a0...Now, the fact that we\u2019re using ... and ... here instead of   the \u201cstandard\u201d ... and ... shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u00a0 It will work the same way.\u00a0 Here are the two derivatives for this   function....\u00a0...Remember how to differentiate natural logarithms....\u00a0... ...Now, we can\u2019t forget the product rule with   derivatives.\u00a0 The product rule will   work the same way here as it does with functions of one variable.\u00a0 We will just need to be careful to remember   which variable we are differentiating with respect to....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start out by differentiating with respect to ....\u00a0   In this case both the cosine and the exponential contain ...\u2019s and so we\u2019ve really got a product   of two functions involving ...\u2019s and   so we\u2019ll need to product rule this up.\u00a0   Here is the derivative with respect to .......\u00a0...Do not forget the ... for functions of one variable.\u00a0   We will be looking at the chain rule for some more complicated   expressions for multivariable functions in a later section.\u00a0 However, at this point we\u2019re treating all   the ...\u2019s as constants and so the   chain rule will continue to work as it did back in Calculus I....\u00a0...Also, don\u2019t forget how to differentiate exponential   functions,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s differentiate with respect to ....\u00a0   In this case we don\u2019t have a product rule to worry about since the   only place that the ... shows up is   in the exponential.\u00a0 Therefore, since ...\u2019s are considered to be constants for   this derivative, the cosine in the front will also be thought of as a   multiplicative constant.\u00a0 Here is the   derivative with respect to .......\u00a0...Find   all of the first order partial derivatives for the following functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...We also can\u2019t forget about the quotient rule.\u00a0 Since there isn\u2019t too much to this one, we   will simply give the derivatives....\u00a0...In the case of the derivative with respect to ... recall that ...\u2019s are constant and so when we differentiate the numerator we   will get zero!...\u00a0... ...Now, we do need to be careful however to not use the   quotient rule when it doesn\u2019t need to be used.\u00a0 In this case we do have a quotient,   however, since the ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s only appear in the numerator and   the ...\u2019s only appear in the   denominator this really isn\u2019t a quotient rule problem....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do the derivatives with respect to ... and ... first.\u00a0 In both these   cases the ...\u2019s are constants and so   the denominator in this is a constant and so we don\u2019t really need to worry   too much about it.\u00a0 Here are the   derivatives for these two cases....\u00a0...Now, in the case of differentiation with respect to ... we can avoid the quotient rule with   a quick rewrite of the function.\u00a0 Here   is the rewrite as well as the derivative with respect to .......\u00a0...We went ahead and put the derivative back into the   \u201coriginal\u201d form just so we could say that we did.\u00a0 In practice you probably don\u2019t really need   to do that....\u00a0... ...In this last

In that section we talked about them because we wrote down the equation of a line in ...\u00a0in terms of a ... (sometimes called a ...).\u00a0 In this section we want to look a little closer at them and we also want to look at some vector functions in ...other than lines....\u00a0...A vector function is a function that takes one or more variables and returns a vector.\u00a0 We\u2019ll spend most of this section looking at vector functions of a single variable as most of the places where vector functions show up here will be vector functions of single variables.\u00a0 We will however briefly look at vector functions of two variables at the end of this section....\u00a0...A vector functions of a single variable in ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0have the form,...respectively, where ..., ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are called the .......\u00a0...The main idea that we want to discuss in this section is that of graphing and identifying the graph given by a vector function.\u00a0 Before we do that however, we should talk briefly about the domain of a vector function.\u00a0 The ... of a vector function is the set of all ...\u2019s for which all the component functions are defined....\u00a0...Determine   the domain of the following function....The first component is defined for all ...\u2019s.\u00a0   The second component is only defined for ....\u00a0 The third component is only defined for ....\u00a0 Putting all of these together gives the   following domain....This is the largest possible interval for which all three   components are defined....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now move into looking at the graph of vector functions.\u00a0 In order to graph a vector function all we do is think of the vector returned by the vector function as a position vector for points on the graph.\u00a0 Recall that a position vector, say ..., is a vector that starts at the origin and ends at the point ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in order to sketch the graph of a vector function all we need to do is plug in some values of ... and then plot points that correspond to the resulting position vector we get out of the vector function....\u00a0...Because it is a little easier to visualize things we\u2019ll start off by looking at graphs of vector functions in ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of each of the following vector functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Okay, the first thing that we need to do is plug in a few   values of ... and get some position   vectors.\u00a0 Here are a few,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, what this tells us is that the following points are   all on the graph of this vector function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a   sketch of this vector function....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this sketch   we\u2019ve included many more evaluations that just those above.\u00a0 Also note that we\u2019ve put in the position   vectors (in gray and dashed) so you can see how all this is working.\u00a0 Note however, that in practice the position   vectors are generally not included in the sketch....\u00a0...In this case it   looks like we\u2019ve got the graph of the line .......\u00a0... ...Here are a couple of evaluations for this vector function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got a   few points on the graph of this function.\u00a0   However, unlike the first part this isn\u2019t really going to be enough   points to get a good idea of this graph.\u00a0   In general, it can take quite a few function evaluations to get an   idea of what the graph is and it\u2019s usually easier to use a computer to do the   graphing....\u00a0...Here is a   sketch of this graph.\u00a0 We\u2019ve put in a   few vectors/evaluations to illustrate them, but the reality is that we did   have to use a computer to get a good sketch here....\u00a0...Both of the vector functions in the above example were in the form,...and what we were really sketching is the graph of ...\u00a0as you probably caught onto.\u00a0 Let\u2019s graph a couple of other vector functions that do not fall into this pattern.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of each of the following vector functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...As we saw in the last part of the previous example it can   really take quite a few function evaluations to really be able to sketch the   graph of a vector function.\u00a0 Because of   that we\u2019ll be skipping all the function evaluations here and just giving the   graph.\u00a0 The main point behind this set   of examples is to not get you too locked into the form we were looking at   above.\u00a0 The first part will also lead   to an important idea that we\u2019ll discuss after this example....\u00a0...So, with that said here are the sketches of each of these....\u00a0... ...So, in this case it looks like we\u2019ve got an ellipse....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the sketch for this vector function....\u00a0...Before we move on to vector functions in ...\u00a0let\u2019s go back and take a quick look at the first vector function we sketched in the previous example, ....\u00a0 The fact that we got an ellipse here should not come as a surprise to you.\u00a0 We know that the first component function gives the ... coordinate and the second component function gives the ... coordinates of the point that we graph.\u00a0 If we strip these out to make this clear we get,...\u00a0...This should look familiar to you.\u00a0 Back when we were looking at ... we saw that this was nothing more than one of the sets of parametric equations that gave an ellipse....\u00a0...This is an important idea in the study of vector functions.\u00a0 Any vector function can be broken down into a set of parametric equations that represent the same graph.\u00a0 In general, the two dimensional vector function, ..., can be broken down into the parametric equations,...\u00a0...\u00a0 Likewise, a three dimensional vector function, ..., can be broken down into the parametric equations,...\u00a0...Do not get too excited about the fact that we\u2019re now looking at parametric equations in ....\u00a0 They work in exactly the same manner as parametric equations in ...\u00a0which we\u2019re used to dealing with already.\u00a0 The only difference is that we now have a third component....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of graphs of vector functions....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following vector function....\u00a0...Notice that this is nothing more than a line.\u00a0 It might help if we rewrite it a little....\u00a0...In this form we can see that this is the equation of a   line that goes through the point ...\u00a0and is parallel to the vector .......\u00a0...To graph this line all that we need to do is plot the   point and then sketch in the parallel vector.\u00a0   In order to get the sketch will assume that the vector is on the line   and will start at the point in the line.\u00a0   To sketch in the line all we do this is extend the parallel vector   into a line....\u00a0...Here is a sketch....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following vector function....\u00a0...In this case to see what we\u2019ve got for a graph let\u2019s get   the parametric equations for the curve....\u00a0...If we ignore the ...   equation for a bit we\u2019ll ...   (hopefully) that the parametric equations for ... and ... give a circle   of radius 2 centered on the origin (or about the ...-axis since we are in ...)....\u00a0...Now, all the parametric equations here tell us is that no   matter what is going on in the graph all the ... coordinates must be 3.\u00a0   So, we get a circle of radius 2 centered on the ...-axis and at the level of .......\u00a0...Here is a sketch....\u00a0...Note that it is very easy to modify the above vector function to get a circle centered on the ... or ...-axis as well.\u00a0 For instance,...will be a circle of radius 10 centered on the ...-axis and at ....\u00a0 In other words, as long as two of the terms are a sine and a cosine (with the same coefficient) and the other is a fixed number then we will have a circle that is centered on the axis that is given by the fixed number....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a modification of this....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following vector function....\u00a0...If this one had a constant in the ... component we would have another circle.\u00a0 However, in this case we don\u2019t have a   constant.\u00a0 Instead we\u2019ve got a ... and that will change the curve.\u00a0 However, because the ... and ... component   functions are still a circle in parametric equations our curve should have a   circular nature to it in some way....\u00a0...In fact, the only change is in the ... component and as ...   increases the ... coordinate will   increase.\u00a0 Also, as ... increases the ... and ... coordinates   will continue to form a circle centered on the ...-axis.\u00a0 Putting these two   ideas together tells us that at we increase ... the circle that is being traced out in the ... and ... directions   should be also be rising....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of this curve....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got a helix (or spiral, depending on what you   want to call it) here....\u00a0...As with circles the component that has the ... will determine the axis that the helix rotates about.\u00a0 For instance,...is a helix that rotates around the ...-axis....\u00a0...Also note that if we allow the coefficients on the sine and cosine for both the circle and helix to be different we will get ellipses....\u00a0...For example,...will be a helix that rotates about the ...-axis and is in the shape of an ellipse....\u00a0...There is a nice formula that we should derive before moving onto vector functions of two variables....\u00a0...Determine   the vector equation for the line segment starting at the point\u00a0 ...\u00a0and ending at the point .......\u00a0...It is important to note here that we only want the   equation of the line segment that starts at ... and ends at ....\u00a0 We don\u2019t want any other portion of the line   and we do want the direction of the line segment preserved as we increase ....\u00a0   With all that said, let\u2019s not worry about that and just find the   vector equation of the line that passes through the two points.\u00a0 Once we have this we will be able to get   what we\u2019re after....\u00a0...So, we need a point on the line.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got two and we will use ....\u00a0   We need a vector that is parallel to the line and since we\u2019ve got two   points we can find the vector between them.\u00a0   This vector will lie on the line and hence be parallel to the   line.\u00a0 Also, let\u2019s remember that we   want to preserve the starting and ending point of the line segment so let\u2019s   construct the vector using the same \u201corientation\u201d....\u00a0...\u00a0...Using this vector and the point ... we get the following vector equation of the line....\u00a0...\u00a0...While this is the vector equation of the line, let\u2019s   rewrite the equation slightly....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is the equation of the line that contains the points ... and ....\u00a0 We of course just want   the line segment that starts at ...   and ends at ....\u00a0 We can get this by simply restricting the   values of .......\u00a0...Notice that ...\u00a0...So, if we restrict ...   to be between zero and one we will cover the line segment and we will start   and end at the correct point....\u00a0...So the vector equation of the line segment that starts at ...\u00a0and ends at ...\u00a0is,...\u00a0...As noted briefly at the beginning of this section we can also have vector functions of two variables.\u00a0 In these cases the graphs of vector function of two variables are surfaces.\u00a0 So, to make sure that we don\u2019t forget that let\u2019s work an example with that as well....\u00a0...Identify   the surface that is described by .......\u00a0...First, notice that in this case the vector function will   in fact be a function of two variables.\u00a0   This will always be the case when we are using vector functions to   represent surfaces....\u00a0...To identify the surface let\u2019s go back to parametric   equations....\u00a0...The first two are really only acknowledging that we are   picking ... and ... for free and then determining ... from our choices of these two.\u00a0   The last equation is the one that we want.\u00a0 We should recognize that function from the   section on ....\u00a0 The third equation is the equation of an   elliptic paraboloid and so the vector function represents an elliptic   paraboloid....\u00a0...As a final topic for this section let\u2019s generalize the idea from the previous example and note that given any function of one variable ( ...\u00a0or ...) or any function of two variables ( ..., ..., or ...) we can always write down a vector form of the equation....\u00a0...For a function of one variable this will be,...and for a

have a 1-D graph   since there are two variables....\u00a0...In ...\u00a0this is a circle centered at the origin with   radius 2....\u00a0...In ...\u00a0however, as with the previous example, this   may or may not be a circle.\u00a0 Since we   have not specified ... in any way we   must assume that ... can take on any   value.\u00a0 In other words, at any value of   ... this equation must be

graphs for this example....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0...Notice that again, if we look to where the cylinder   intersects the ...-plane we will   again get the circle from ...   .......\u00a0...We need to be careful with the last two examples.\u00a0 It would be tempting to take the results of these and say that we can\u2019t graph lines or circles in ...\u00a0and yet that

...\u00a0we would need to do something like ...\u00a0at ....\u00a0 This would be a circle of radius 2 centered on the ...-axis at the level of ....\u00a0 So, as long as we specify a ... we will get a circle and not a cylinder. We will see an easier way to specify circles in a later section....\u00a0...We could do the same thing with the line from the second example.\u00a0 However, we will be looking at lines in more generality in the next section and so we\u2019ll see a better way to deal with lines in ...\u00a0there....\u00a0...The point of the examples in this section is to make sure that we are being careful with graphing equations and making sure that we always remember which coordinate system that we are in....\u00a0...Another quick point to make here is that, as we\u2019ve seen in the above examples, many graphs of equations in ...\u00a0are surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t graph curves in ....\u00a0 We can and will graph curves in\u00a0 ...\u00a0as well as we\u2019ll see later in this chapter.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/3DCoords.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus III - The 3-D Coordinate System", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We now move into one of the main applications of differential equations both in this class and in general.\u00a0 Modeling is the process of writing a differential equation to describe a physical situation.\u00a0 Almost all of the differential equations that you will use in your job (for the engineers out there in the audience) are there because somebody, at some time, modeled a situation to come up with the differential equation that you are using....\u00a0...This section is not intended to completely teach you how to go about modeling all physical situations.\u00a0 A whole course could be devoted to the subject of modeling and still not cover everything!\u00a0 This section is designed to introduce you to the process of modeling and show you what is involved in modeling.\u00a0 We will look at three different situations in this section : Mixing Problems, Population Problems, and Falling Bodies....\u00a0...In all of these situations we will be forced to make assumptions that do not accurately depict reality in most cases, but without them the problems would be very difficult and beyond the scope of this discussion (and the course in most cases to be honest)....\u00a0...So let\u2019s get started....\u00a0...In these problems we will start with a substance that is dissolved in a liquid.\u00a0 Liquid will be entering and leaving a holding tank.\u00a0 The liquid entering the tank may or may not contain more of the substance dissolved in it.\u00a0 Liquid leaving the tank will of course contain the substance dissolved in it.\u00a0 If ... gives the amount of the substance dissolved in the liquid in the tank at any time ... we want to develop a differential equation that, when solved, will give us an expression for ....\u00a0 Note as well that in many situations we can think of air as a liquid for the purposes of these kinds of discussions and so we don\u2019t actually need to have an actual liquid, but could instead use air as the \u201cliquid\u201d....\u00a0...The main assumption that we\u2019ll be using here is that the concentration of the substance in the liquid is uniform throughout the tank.\u00a0 Clearly this will not be the case, but if we allow the concentration to vary depending on the location in the tank the problem becomes very difficult and will involve partial differential equations, which is not the focus of this course....\u00a0...The main \u201cequation\u201d that we\u2019ll be using to model this situation is :...\u00a0...Rate of...change of...=...Rate

  (concentration of substance in liquid exiting)...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at the first problem....\u00a0...A   1500 gallon tank initially contains 600 gallons of water with 5 lbs of salt   dissolved in it.\u00a0 Water enters the tank   at a rate of 9 gal/hr and the water entering the tank has a salt   concentration of ...\u00a0lbs/gal.\u00a0   If a well mixed solution leaves the tank at a rate of 6 gal/hr, how   much salt is in the tank when it overflows?...\u00a0...First off, let\u2019s address the \u201cwell mixed solution\u201d   bit.\u00a0 This is the assumption that was   mentioned earlier.\u00a0 We are going to   assume that the instant the water enters the tank it somehow instantly   disperses evenly throughout the tank to give a uniform concentration of salt   in the tank at every point.\u00a0 Again,   this will clearly not be the case in reality, but it will allow us to do the   problem....\u00a0...Now, to set up the IVP that we\u2019ll need to solve to get ... we\u2019ll need the flow rate of the   water entering (we\u2019ve got that), the concentration of the salt in the water   entering (we\u2019ve got that), the flow rate of the water leaving (we\u2019ve got   that) and the concentration of the salt in the water exiting (we don\u2019t have   this yet)....\u00a0...So, we first need to determine the concentration of the   salt in the water exiting the tank.\u00a0   Since we are assuming a uniform concentration of salt in the tank the   concentration at any point in the tank and hence in the water exiting is   given by,...\u00a0...The amount at any time ...   is easy it\u2019s just ....\u00a0 The volume is also pretty easy.\u00a0 We start with 600 gallons and every hour 9   gallons enters and 6 gallons leave.\u00a0   So, if we use ... in hours,   every hour 3 gallons enters the tank, or at any time ... there is 600 + 3...   gallons of water in the tank....\u00a0...So, the IVP for this situation is,...\u00a0...This is a linear differential equation and it isn\u2019t too   difficult to solve (hopefully).\u00a0 We   will show most of the details, but leave the description of the solution   process out.\u00a0 If you need a refresher   on solving linear first order differential equations go back and take a look   at that .......\u00a0...So, here\u2019s the general solution.\u00a0 Now, apply the initial condition to get the   value of the constant, .......\u00a0...So, the amount of salt in the tank at any time ... is....\u00a0...Now, the tank will overflow at ... = 300 hrs.\u00a0 The amount of   salt in the tank at that time is....\u00a0...Here\u2019s a graph of the salt in the tank before it   overflows....\u00a0...Note that the whole graph should have small oscillations   in it as you can see in the range from 200 to 250.\u00a0 The scale of the oscillations however was   small enough that the program used to generate the image had trouble showing   all of them. ...\u00a0...The work was a little messy with that one, but they will often be that way so don\u2019t get excited about it.\u00a0 This first example also assumed that nothing would change throughout the life of the process.\u00a0 That, of course will usually not be the case.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at an example where something changes in the process....\u00a0...A   1000 gallon holding tank that catches runoff from some chemical process   initially has 800 gallons of water with 2 ounces of pollution dissolved in   it.\u00a0 Polluted water flows into the tank   at a rate of 3 gal/hr and contains 5 ounces/gal of pollution in it. A well   mixed solution leaves the tank at 3 gal/hr as well.\u00a0 When the amount of pollution in the holding   tank reaches 500 ounces the inflow of polluted water is cut off and fresh   water will enter the tank at a decreased rate of 2 gal/hr while the outflow   is increased to 4 gal/hr.\u00a0 Determine   the amount of pollution in the tank at any time .......\u00a0...Okay, so clearly the pollution in the tank will increase   as time passes.\u00a0 If the amount of   pollution ever reaches the maximum allowed there will be a change in the   situation.\u00a0 This will necessitate a   change in the differential equation describing the process as well.\u00a0 In other words, we\u2019ll need two IVP\u2019s for   this problem.\u00a0 One will describe the   initial situation when polluted runoff is entering the tank and one for after   the maximum allowed pollution is reached and fresh water is entering the   tank....\u00a0...Here are the two IVP\u2019s for this problem....The first one is fairly straight forward and will be valid   until the maximum amount of pollution is reached.\u00a0 We\u2019ll call that time ...\u00a0 Also, the   volume in the tank remains constant during this time so we don\u2019t need to do   anything fancy with that this time in the second term as we did in the previous   example....\u00a0...We\u2019ll need a little explanation for the second one.\u00a0 First notice that we don\u2019t \u201cstart over\u201d at ... = 0.\u00a0   We start this one at ...,   the time at which the new process starts.\u00a0   Next, fresh water is flowing into the tank and so the concentration of   pollution in the incoming water is zero.\u00a0   This will drop out the first term, and that\u2019s okay so don\u2019t worry   about that.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, notice that the volume at any time looks a little   funny.\u00a0 During this time frame we are   losing two gallons of water every hour of the process so we need the \u201c-2\u201d in   there to account for that.\u00a0 However, we   can\u2019t just use ... as we did in the   previous example.\u00a0 When this new   process starts up there needs to be 800 gallons of water in the tank and if   we just use ... there we won\u2019t have   the required 800 gallons that we need in the equation.\u00a0 So, to make sure that we have the proper   volume we need to put in the difference in times.\u00a0 In this way once we are one hour into the   new process (...   1) we will have 798 gallons in the tank as required....\u00a0...Finally, the second process can\u2019t continue forever as   eventually the tank will empty.\u00a0 This   is denoted in the time restrictions as ...\u00a0 We can also note that ...= ...   + 400 since the tank will empty 400 hours after this new process starts up.\u00a0 Well, it will end provided something   doesn\u2019t come along and start changing the situation again....\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve got all the explanations taken care   of here\u2019s the simplified version of the IVP\u2019s that we\u2019ll be solving....\u00a0...The first IVP is a fairly simple linear differential   equation so we\u2019ll leave the details of the solution to you to check.\u00a0 Upon solving you get....\u00a0...Now, we need to find ....\u00a0 This isn\u2019t too bad all we need to do is   determine when the amount of pollution reaches 500.\u00a0 So we need to solve....\u00a0...So, the second process will pick up at 35.475 hours.\u00a0 For completeness sake here is the IVP with   this information inserted....\u00a0...This differential equation is both linear and separable   and again isn\u2019t terribly difficult to solve so I\u2019ll leave the details to you   again to check that we should get....\u00a0...So, a solution that encompasses the complete running time   of the process is...\u00a0...Here is a graph of the amount of pollution in the tank at   any time .......\u00a0...As you can surely see, these problems can get quite complicated if you want them to.\u00a0 Take the last example.\u00a0 A more realistic situation would be that once the pollution dropped below some predetermined point the polluted runoff would, in all likelihood, be allowed to flow back in and then the whole process would repeat itself.\u00a0 So, realistically, there should be at least one more IVP in the process....\u00a0...Let\u2019s move on to another type of problem now....\u00a0...These are somewhat easier than the mixing problems although, in some ways, they are very similar to mixing problems.\u00a0 So, if ... represents a population in a given region at any time ... the basic equation that we\u2019ll use is identical to the one that we used for mixing.\u00a0 Namely,...Rate of...change of...=...Rate at ...which ...enters the ...region...-...Rate at ...which ...exits the ...region...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Here the rate of change of ... is still the derivative.\u00a0 What\u2019s different this time is the rate at which the population enters and exits the region.\u00a0 For population problems all the ways for a population to enter the region are included in the entering rate.\u00a0 Birth rate and migration into the region are examples of terms that would go into the rate at which the population enters the region.\u00a0 Likewise, all the ways for a population to leave an area will be included in the exiting rate.\u00a0 Therefore things like death rate, migration out and predation are examples of terms that would go into the rate at which the population exits the area....\u00a0...Here\u2019s an example....\u00a0...A   population of insects in a region will grow at a rate that is proportional to   their current population.\u00a0 In the   absence of any outside factors the population will triple in two weeks   time.\u00a0 On any given day there is a net   migration into the area of 15 insects and 16 are eaten by the local bird   population and 7 die of natural causes.\u00a0   If there are initially 100 insects in the area will the population   survive?\u00a0 If not, when do they die out?...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start out by looking at the birth rate.\u00a0 We are told that the insects will be born   at a rate that is proportional to the current population.\u00a0 This means that the birth rate can be written   as...where ... is a   positive constant that will need to be determined.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take everything into account and   get the IVP for this problem....\u00a0...Note that in the first line we used parenthesis to note   which terms went into which part of the differential equation.\u00a0 Also note that we don\u2019t make use of the   fact that the population will triple in two weeks time in the absence of   outside factors here.\u00a0 In the absence   of outside factors means that the ONLY thing that we can consider is birth   rate.\u00a0 Nothing else can enter into the   picture and clearly we have other influences in the differential equation....\u00a0...So, just how does this tripling come into play?\u00a0 Well, we should also note that without   knowing ... we will have a difficult   time solving the IVP completely.\u00a0 We   will use the fact that the population triples in two week time to help us   find ....\u00a0 In the absence of outside factors the   differential equation would become....\u00a0...Note that since we used days as the time frame in the   actual IVP I needed to convert the two weeks to 14 days.\u00a0 We could have just as easily converted the   original IVP to weeks as the time frame, in which case there would have been   a net change of ...56   per week instead of the ...8   per day that we are currently using in the original differential equation....\u00a0...Okay back to the differential equation that ignores all   the outside factors.\u00a0 This differential   equation is separable and linear and is a simple differential equation to   solve.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave the detail to you to   get the general solution....\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives ... = 100.\u00a0 Now apply the   second condition....\u00a0...We need to solve this for ....\u00a0 First divide both sides   by 100, then take the natural log of both sides....\u00a0...We made use of the fact that ...\u00a0here to simplify the problem.\u00a0 Now, that we have ... we can go back and solve the original differential   equation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll rewrite it a little   for the solution process....\u00a0...This is a fairly simple linear differential equation, but   that coefficient of ... always get   people bent out of shape, so we\u2019ll go through at least some of the details   here....\u00a0...Now, don\u2019t get excited about the integrating factor   here.\u00a0 It\u2019s just like ...\u00a0only this time the constant is a little more   complicated than just a 2, but it is a constant!\u00a0 Now, solve the differential equation....\u00a0...Again, do not get excited about doing the right hand   integral, it\u2019s just like integrating ...!\u00a0 Applying the initial condition gives the   following....\u00a0...Now, the exponential has a positive exponent and so will   go to plus infinity as ...   increases.\u00a0 Its coefficient, however,   is negative and so the whole population will go negative eventually.\u00a0 Clearly, population can\u2019t be negative, but   in order for the population to go negative it must pass through zero.\u00a0 In other words, eventually all the insects   must die.\u00a0 So, they don\u2019t survive and   we can solve the following to determine when they die out....\u00a0...So, the insects will survive for around 7.2 weeks.\u00a0 Here is a graph of the population during   the time in which they survive....\u00a0...As with the mixing problems, we could make the population problems more complicated by changing the circumstances at some point in time.\u00a0 For instance, if at some point in time the local bird population saw a decrease due to disease they wouldn\u2019t eat as much after that point and a second differential equation to govern the time after this point....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a look at the final type of problem that we\u2019ll be modeling in this section....\u00a0...This will not be the first time that we\u2019ve looked into falling bodies.\u00a0 If you recall, we looked at one of these when we were looking at ....\u00a0 In that section we saw that the basic equation that we\u2019ll use is ...\u2019s Second Law of Motion....\u00a0...The two forces that we\u2019ll be looking at here are gravity and air resistance.\u00a0 The main issue with these problems is to correctly define conventions and then remember to keep those conventions.\u00a0 By this we mean define which direction will be termed the positive direction and then make sure that all your forces match that convention.\u00a0 This is especially important for air resistance as this is usually dependent on the velocity and so the \u201csign\u201d of the velocity can and does affect the \u201csign\u201d of the air resistance force....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...A   50 kg mass is shot from a cannon straight up with an initial velocity of   10m/s off a bridge that is 100 meters above the ground.\u00a0 If air resistance is given by 5... determine the velocity of the mass   when it hits the ground....\u00a0...First, notice that when we say straight up, we really mean   straight up, but in such a way that it will miss the bridge on the way back   down.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of the   situation....\u00a0...Notice the conventions that we set up for this   problem.\u00a0 Since the vast majority of   the motion will be in the downward direction we decided to assume that   everything acting in the downward direction should be positive.\u00a0 Note that we also defined the \u201czero   position\u201d as the bridge, which makes the ground have a \u201cposition\u201d of 100....\u00a0...Okay, if you think about it we actually have two   situations here.\u00a0 The initial phase in   which the mass is rising in the air and the second phase when the mass is on   its way down.\u00a0 We will need to examine   both situations and set up an IVP for each.\u00a0   We will do this simultaneously.\u00a0   Here are the forces that are acting on the object on the way up and on   the way down....\u00a0...Notice that the air resistance force needs a negative in   both cases in order to get the correct \u201csign\u201d or direction on the force.\u00a0 When the mass is moving upwards the   velocity (and hence ...) is negative,   yet the force must be acting in a downward direction.\u00a0 Therefore, the \u201c-\u201d must be part of the force   to make sure that, overall, the force is positive and hence acting in the   downward direction.\u00a0 Likewise, when the   mass is moving downward the velocity (and so ...) is positive.\u00a0 Therefore,   the air resistance must also have a \u201c-\u201d in order to make sure that it\u2019s   negative and hence acting in the upward direction....\u00a0...So, the IVP for each of these situations are....\u00a0...In the second IVP, the ...   is the time when the object is at the highest point and is ready to start on   the way down.\u00a0 Note that at this time   the velocity would be zero.\u00a0 Also note   that the initial condition of the first differential equation will have to be   negative since the initial velocity is upward....\u00a0...In this case, the differential equation for both of the   situations is identical.\u00a0 This won\u2019t   always happen, but in those cases where it does, we can ignore the second IVP   and just let the first govern the whole process....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s actually plug in for the mass and gravity (we\u2019ll   be using ... = 9.8 m/s...   here).\u00a0 We\u2019ll go ahead and divide out   the mass while we\u2019re at it since we\u2019ll need to do that eventually anyway....\u00a0...This is a simple linear differential equation to solve so   we\u2019ll leave the details to you.\u00a0 Upon   solving we arrive at the following equation for the velocity of the object at   any time .......\u00a0...Okay, we want the velocity of the ball when it hits the   ground.\u00a0 Of course we need to know ... it hits the ground before we can   ask this.\u00a0 In order to find this we   will need to find the position function.\u00a0   This is easy enough to do....\u00a0...We can now use the fact that I took the convention that ...(0) = 0 to find that ... = -1080.\u00a0 The position at any time is then....\u00a0...To determine when the mass hits the ground we just need to   solve....\u00a0...We\u2019ve got two solutions here, but since we are starting   things at ... = 0, the negative is   clearly the incorrect value.\u00a0 Therefore   the mass hits the ground at ... =   5.98147.\u00a0 The velocity of the object   upon hitting the ground is then....\u00a0...This last example gave us an example of a situation where the two differential equations needed for the problem ended up being identical and so we didn\u2019t need the second one after all.\u00a0 Be careful however to not always expect this.\u00a0 We could very easily change this problem so that it required two different differential equations.\u00a0 For instance we could have had a parachute on the mass open at the top of its arc changing its air resistance.\u00a0 This would have completely changed the second differential equation and forced us to use it as well.\u00a0 Or, we could have put a river under the bridge so that before it actually hit the ground it would have first had to go through some water which would have a different \u201cair\u201d resistance for that phase necessitating a new differential equation for that portion....\u00a0...Or, we could be really crazy and have both the parachute and the river which would then require three IVP\u2019s to be solved before we determined the velocity of the mass before it actually hits the solid ground....\u00a0...Before leaving this section let\u2019s work a couple examples illustrating the importance of remembering the conventions that you set up for the positive direction in these problems....\u00a0...Awhile back I gave my students a problem in which a sky diver jumps out of a plane.\u00a0 Most of my students are engineering majors and following the standard convention from most of their engineering classes they defined the positive direction as upward, despite the fact that all the motion in the problem was downward.\u00a0 There is nothing wrong with this assumption, however, because they forgot the convention that up was positive they did not correctly deal with the air resistance which caused them to get the incorrect answer....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s take a look at the problem and set up the IVP that will give the sky diver's velocity at any time .......\u00a0...Set   up the IVP that will give the velocity of a 60 kg sky diver that jumps out of   a plane with no initial velocity and an air resistance of ....\u00a0 For this example assume that the positive   direction is upward....\u00a0...Here are the forces that are acting on the sky diver...Because of the conventions the force due to gravity is   negative and the force due to air resistance is positive.\u00a0 As set up, these forces have the correct   sign and so the IVP is...\u00a0...The problem arises when you go to remove the absolute   value bars.\u00a0 In order to do the problem   they do need to be removed.\u00a0 This is   where most of the students made their mistake.\u00a0 Because they had forgotten about the   convention and the direction of motion they just dropped the absolute value   bars to get....\u00a0...So, why is this incorrect?\u00a0   Well remember that the convention is that positive is upward.\u00a0 However in this case the object is moving   downward and so ... is negative!\u00a0 Upon dropping the absolute value bars the   air resistance became a negative force and hence was acting in the downward   direction!...\u00a0...To get the correct IVP recall that because ... is negative then |...| = -....\u00a0 Using this, the air   resistance becomes F... = -0.8...   and despite appearances this is a positive force since the \u201c-\u201d cancels out   against the velocity (which is negative) to get a positive force.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The correct IVP is then...\u00a0...Plugging in the mass gives...\u00a0...For the sake of completeness the velocity of the sky   diver, at least until the parachute opens, which I didn\u2019t include in this   problem is....\u00a0...This mistake was made in part because the students were in a hurry and weren\u2019t paying attention, but also because they simply forgot about their convention and the direction of motion!\u00a0 Don\u2019t fall into this mistake.\u00a0 Always pay attention to your conventions and what is happening in the problems....\u00a0...Just to show you the difference here is the problem worked by assuming that down is positive....\u00a0...Set   up the IVP that will give the velocity of a 60 kg sky diver that jumps out of   a plane with no initial velocity and an air resistance of ....\u00a0 For this example assume that the positive   direction is downward....\u00a0...Here are the forces that are acting on the sky diver...In this case the force due to gravity is positive since   it\u2019s a downward force and air resistance is an upward force and so needs to   be negative.\u00a0 In this case since the   motion is downward the velocity is positive so |...| = ....\u00a0 The air resistance is then F...=   -0.8....\u00a0 The IVP for this case is...\u00a0...Plugging in the mass gives...\u00a0...Solving this gives...\u00a0...This is the same solution as the previous example, except   that it\u2019s got the opposite sign.\u00a0 This   is to be expected since the conventions have been switched between the two   examples.", "url":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "I\u2019ve called this section Intervals of Validity because all of the examples will involve them.\u00a0 However, there is a lot more to this section.\u00a0 We will see a couple of theorems that will tell us when we can solve a differential equation.\u00a0 We will also see some of the differences between linear and nonlinear differential equations....\u00a0...First let's take a look at a theorem about linear first order differential equations.\u00a0 This is a very important theorem although we\u2019re not going to really use it for its most important aspect....\u00a0...Consider the following IVP....If ... and ... are continuous functions on an   open interval ...\u00a0and the interval contains ..., then there is a unique   solution to the IVP on that interval....\u00a0...So, just what does this theorem tell us? First, it tells us that for nice enough linear first order differential equations solutions are guaranteed to exist and more importantly the solution will be unique. We may not be able to find the solution, but do know that it exists and that there will only be one of them.\u00a0 This is the very important aspect of this theorem.\u00a0 Knowing that a differential equation has a unique solution is sometimes more important than actually having the solution itself!...\u00a0...Next, if the interval in the theorem is the largest possible interval on which ... and ... are continuous then the interval is the interval of validity for the solution. This means, that for linear first order differential equations, we won't need to actually solve the differential equation in order to find the interval of validity. Notice as well that the interval of validity will depend only partially on the initial condition. The interval must contain ..., but the value of ...,...has no effect on the interval of validity....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Without   solving, determine the interval of validity for the following initial value   problem....   ...First, in order to use the theorem to find the interval of   validity we must write the differential equation in the proper form given in   the theorem. So we will need to divide out by the coefficient of the   derivative....\u00a0...Next, we need to identify where the two functions are not   continuous. This will allow us to find all possible intervals of validity for   the differential equation. So, ...   will be discontinuous at ...\u00a0since these points will give a division by   zero. Likewise, ...   will also be discontinuous at ...\u00a0as well as ... since at this point   we will have the natural logarithm of zero. Note that in this case we won't   have to worry about natural log of negative numbers because of the absolute   values....\u00a0...Now, with these points in hand we can break up the real   number line into four intervals where both ... and ... will be continuous. These four intervals   are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The endpoints of each of the intervals are points where at   least one of the two functions is discontinuous. This will guarantee that   both functions are continuous everywhere in each interval....\u00a0...Finally, let's identify the actual interval of validity   for the initial value problem. The actual interval of validity is the interval   that will contain ... .... So, the interval of validity for the initial value problem   is....\u00a0...In this last example we need to be careful to not jump to the conclusion that the other three intervals cannot be intervals of validity.\u00a0 By changing the initial condition, in particular the value of ..., we can make any of the four intervals the interval of validity....\u00a0...The first theorem required a linear differential equation.\u00a0 There is a similar theorem for non-linear first order differential equations.\u00a0 This theorem is not as useful for finding intervals of validity as the first theorem was so we won\u2019t be doing all that much with it....\u00a0...Here is the theorem....\u00a0...Consider the following IVP....If ... and ...\u00a0are continuous functions in some rectangle ...,   ...\u00a0containing the point\u00a0 (...,...) then there is a unique   solution to the IVP in some interval ...   ...\u00a0... that is contained in ...\u00a0...That\u2019s it.\u00a0 Unlike the first theorem, this one cannot really be used to find an interval of validity.\u00a0 So, we will know that a unique solution exists if the conditions of the theorem are met, but we will actually need the solution in order to determine its interval of validity.\u00a0 Note as well that for non-linear differential equations it appears that the value of ... may affect the interval of validity....\u00a0...Here is an example of the problems that can arise when the conditions of this theorem aren\u2019t met....\u00a0...Determine   all possible solutions to the following IVP....First, notice that this differential equation does NOT   satisfy the conditions of the theorem....\u00a0...So, the function is continuous on any interval, but the   derivative is not continuous at ...=   0 and so will not be continuous at any interval containing ... = 0.\u00a0   In order to use the theorem both must be continuous on an interval   that contains ... = 0 and   this is problem for us since we do have ...   = 0....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s actually work the problem.\u00a0 This differential equation is separable and   is fairly simple to solve....\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives ... = 0 and so the solution is....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got two possible solutions here, both of which   satisfy the differential equation and the initial condition.\u00a0 There is also a third solution to the   IVP.\u00a0 ... is also a solution to the differential equation and   satisfies the initial condition....\u00a0...In this last example we had a very simple IVP and it only violated one of the conditions of the theorem, yet it had three different solutions.\u00a0 All the examples we\u2019ve worked in the previous sections satisfied the conditions of this theorem and had a single unique solution to the IVP.\u00a0 This example is a useful reminder of the fact that, in the field of differential equations, things don\u2019t always behave nicely.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to forget this as most of the problems that are worked in a differential equations class are nice and behave in a nice, predictable manner....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one final example that will illustrate one of the differences between linear and non-linear differential equations....\u00a0...Determine   the interval of validity for the initial value problem below and give its   dependence on the value of...Before proceeding in this problem, we should note that the   differential equation is non-linear and meets both conditions of the Theorem   2 and so there will be a unique solution to the IVP for each possible value   of .......\u00a0...Also, note that the problem asks for any dependence of the   interval of validity on the value of ....\u00a0 This immediately illustrates a difference   between linear and non-linear differential equations.\u00a0 Intervals of validity for linear   differential equations do not depend on the value of ....\u00a0 Intervals   of validity for non-linear differential can depend on the value of ... as we pointed out after   the second theorem....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s solve the IVP and get some intervals of   validity....\u00a0...First note that if ...   ...then ... is the solution and this has an interval of validity of...\u00a0...So for the rest of the problem let's assume that ....\u00a0 Now, the differential equation is separable   so let's solve it and get a general solution....\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives ...\u00a0...The solution is then....Now that we have a solution to the initial value problem we   can start finding intervals of validity.\u00a0   From the solution we can see that the only problem that we\u2019ll have is   division by zero at...\u00a0...This leads to two possible intervals of validity....\u00a0...That actual interval of validity will be the interval that   contains ... = 0.\u00a0 This however, depends on the value of ....\u00a0 If ...   < 0 then ...\u00a0and so the second interval will contain ... = 0.\u00a0 Likewise if ... > 0 then ...\u00a0and in this case the first interval will   contain ... = 0....\u00a0...This leads to the following possible intervals of   validity, depending on the value of ....   ...\u00a0...On a side note, notice that the solution, in its final   form, will also work if ...   ...\u00a0...So what did this example show us about the difference between linear and non-linear differential equations?...\u00a0...First, as pointed out in the solution to the example, intervals of validity for non-linear differential equations can depend on the value of ..., whereas intervals of validity for linear differential equations don\u2019t....\u00a0...Second, intervals of validity for linear differential equations can be found from the differential equation with no knowledge of the solution.\u00a0 This is definitely not the case with non-linear differential equations.\u00a0 It would be very difficult to see how any of these intervals in the last example could be found from the differential equation.\u00a0 Knowledge of the solution was required in order for us to find the interval of validity.", "url":

Most of the solutions that we will get from separable differential equations will not be valid for all values of .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s start things off with a fairly simple example so we can see the process without getting lost in details of the other issues that often arise with these problems....\u00a0...Solve   the following differential equation and determine the interval of validity   for the solution....It is clear, hopefully, that this differential equation is   separable.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s separate the differential   equation and integrate both sides.\u00a0 As   with the linear first order officially we will pick up a constant of   integration on both sides from the integrals on each side of the equal sign.\u00a0 The two can be moved to the same side and absorbed into each other.\u00a0 We will use   the convention that puts the single constant on the side with the ...\u2019s....\u00a0...So, we now have an implicit solution.\u00a0 This solution is easy enough to get an   explicit solution, however before getting that it is usually easier to find   the value of the constant at this point.\u00a0   So apply the initial condition and find the value of .......\u00a0...Plug this into the general solution and then solve to get   an explicit solution....\u00a0...Now, as far as solutions go we\u2019ve got the solution.\u00a0 We do need to start worrying about   intervals of validity however.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Recall that there are two conditions that define an   interval of validity.\u00a0 First, it must   be a continuous interval with no breaks or holes in it.\u00a0 Second it must contain the value of the   independent variable in the initial condition, ... 1 in this case....\u00a0...So, for our case we\u2019ve got to avoid two values of ....\u00a0   Namely, ...\u00a0since these will give us division by   zero.\u00a0 This gives us three possible   intervals of validity....\u00a0...\u00a0...However, only one of these will contain the value of ... from the initial condition and so we   can see that ...must be the interval of validity for this solution.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a graph of the solution....\u00a0...Note that this does not say that either of the other two   intervals listed above can\u2019t be the interval of validity for any   solution.\u00a0 With the proper initial   condition either of these could have been the interval of validity....\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify the details of the   following claims.\u00a0 If we use an initial   condition of ...we will get exactly the same solution however in this case   the interval of validity would be the first one....\u00a0...Likewise, if we use ...as the initial condition we again get exactly the same   solution and in this case the third interval becomes the interval of   validity....So, simply changing the initial condition a little can   give any of the possible intervals....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP and find the interval of validity for the solution....This differential equation is clearly separable, so let's   put it in the proper form and then integrate both sides....\u00a0...We now have our implicit solution, so as with the first   example let\u2019s apply the initial condition at this point to determine the   value of .......\u00a0...The implicit solution is then...\u00a0...We now need to find the explicit solution.\u00a0 This is actually easier than it might look   and you already know how to do it.\u00a0   First we need to rewrite the solution a little...\u00a0...To solve this all we need to recognize is that this is   quadratic in ... and so we can use   the quadratic formula to solve it.\u00a0   However, unlike quadratics you are used to, at least some of the   \u201cconstants\u201d will not actually be constant, but will in fact involve ...\u2019s....\u00a0...So, upon using the quadratic formula on this we get....\u00a0...Next, notice that we can factor a 4 out from under the   square root (it will come out as a 2\u2026) and then simplify a little....\u00a0...We are almost there. Notice that we\u2019ve actually got two   solutions here (the \u201c...\u201d) and we only want a single   solution.\u00a0 In fact, only one of the   signs can be correct. So, to figure out which one is correct we can reapply   the initial condition to this.\u00a0 Only   one of the signs will give the correct value so we can use this to figure out   which one of the signs is correct. Plugging ... into the solution   gives....\u00a0...In this case it looks like the \u201c+\u201d is the correct sign for   our solution.\u00a0 Note that it is   completely possible that the\u00a0 \u201c...\u201d   could be the solution so don\u2019t always expect it to be one or the other....\u00a0...The explicit solution for our differential equation is....\u00a0...To finish the example out we need to determine the   interval of validity for the solution. If we were to put a large negative   value of ...   in the solution we would end up with complex values in our solution and we   want to avoid complex numbers in our solutions here. So, we will need to   determine which values of ...   will give real solutions. To do this we will need to solve the following   inequality....\u00a0...In other words, we need to make sure that the quantity   under the radical stays positive....\u00a0...Using a computer algebra system like Maple or Mathematica   we see that the left side is zero at ...   as well as two complex values, but we can ignore complex values for interval   of validity computations. Finally a graph of the quantity under the radical   is shown below.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in order to get real solutions we will need to require   ...because this is the range of ...\u2019s for which the quantity is   positive.\u00a0 Notice as well that this   interval also contains the value of ...   that is in the initial condition as it should....\u00a0...Therefore, the interval of validity of the solution is ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is graph of the solution....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP and find the interval of validity of the solution....First separate and then integrate both sides....\u00a0...Apply the initial condition to get the value of .......\u00a0...The implicit solution is then,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s solve for .......\u00a0...Reapplying the initial condition shows us that the \u201c...\u201d   is the correct sign.\u00a0 The explicit   solution is then,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s get the interval of validity.\u00a0 That\u2019s easier than it might look for this   problem.\u00a0 First, since ...\u00a0the \u201cinner\u201d root will not be a problem.\u00a0 Therefore all we need to worry about is   division by zero and negatives under the \u201couter\u201d root.\u00a0 We can take care of both by requiring...\u00a0...Note that we were able to square both sides of the inequality   because both sides of the inequality are guaranteed to be positive in this   case.\u00a0 Finally solving for ... we see that the only possible range   of ...\u2019s that will not give division   by zero or square roots of negative numbers will be,...and nicely enough this also contains the initial condition   ....\u00a0 This interval is therefore our interval of   validity.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a graph of the solution....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP and find the interval of validity of the solution....This differential equation is easy enough to separate, so   let's do that and then integrate both sides....\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives...\u00a0...This then gives an implicit solution of....\u00a0...We can easily find the explicit solution to this   differential equation by simply taking the natural log of both sides....\u00a0...Finding the interval of validity is the last step that we   need to take. Recall that we can't plug negative values or zero into a   logarithm, so we need to solve the following inequality...\u00a0...The quadratic will be zero at the two points ....   A graph of the quadratic (shown below) shows that there are in fact two   intervals in which we will get positive values of the polynomial and hence   can be possible intervals of validity....So, possible intervals of validity are ...\u00a0...From the graph of the quadratic we can see that the second   one contains ... = 5, the value of   the independent variable from the initial condition.\u00a0 Therefore the interval of validity for this   solution is....\u00a0...Here is a graph of the solution....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP and find the interval of validity for the solution....This is actually a fairly simple differential equation to   solve.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing this one mostly   because of the interval of validity.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, get things separated out and then integrate....\u00a0...Now, apply the initial condition to find .......\u00a0...So, the implicit solution is then,...\u00a0...Solving for ...   gets us our explicit solution....\u00a0...Now, there are two problems for our solution here.\u00a0 First we need to avoid ...\u00a0= 0 because of the natural log.\u00a0 Notice that because of the absolute value   on the ...\u00a0we don\u2019t need to worry about ...\u00a0being negative. We will also need to avoid   division by zero.\u00a0 In other words, we   need to avoid the following points....\u00a0...So, these three points break the number line up into four   portions, each of which could be an interval of validity....\u00a0...The interval that will be the actual interval of validity   is the one that contains ...\u00a0= 1.\u00a0   Therefore, the interval of validity is ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a graph of the solution....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....This problem will require a little work to get it   separated and in a form that we can integrate, so let's do that first....\u00a0...Now, with a little integration by parts on both sides we   can get an implicit solution....\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives....\u00a0...Therefore, the implicit solution is....\u00a0...It is not possible to find an explicit solution for this   problem and so we will have to leave the solution in its implicit form.   Finding intervals of validity from implicit solutions can often be very   difficult so we will also not bother with that for this problem....\u00a0...As this last example showed it is not always possible to find explicit solutions so be on the lookout for those cases.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Separable.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Differential Equations - Separable Equations", "subject": "math"}},

We   could also find an explicit solution if we wanted to, but we\u2019ll hold off on   that until the next example....\u00a0...Okay, so what did we learn from the last example?\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at things a little more generally.\u00a0 Suppose that we have the following differential equation....\u00a0...Note that it\u2019s important that it be in this form!\u00a0 There must be an \u201c= 0\u201d on one side and the sign separating the two terms must be a \u201c+\u201d.\u00a0 Now, if there is a function somewhere out there in the world, ..., so that,...then we call the differential equation ....\u00a0 In these cases we can write the differential equation as...\u00a0...Then using the chain rule from Calculus III we can further reduce the differential equation to the following derivative,...\u00a0...The (implicit) solution to an exact differential equation is then...\u00a0...Well, it\u2019s the solution provided we can find ... anyway.\u00a0 Therefore, once we have the function we can always just jump straight to ... to get an implicit solution to our differential equation....\u00a0...Finding the function ... is clearly the central task in determining if a differential equation is exact and in finding its solution. As we will see, finding ... can be a somewhat lengthy process in which there is the chance of mistakes. Therefore, it would be nice if there was some simple test that we could use before even starting to see if a differential equation is exact or not. This will be especially useful if it turns out that the differential equation is not exact, since in this case ...will not exist. It would be a waste of time to try and find a nonexistent function!...\u00a0...So, let's see if we can find a test for exact differential equations. Let's start with ... and assume that the differential equation is in fact exact.\u00a0 Since it\u2019s exact we know that somewhere out there is a function ... that satisfies...\u00a0...Now, provided ... is continuous and its first order derivatives are also continuous we know that ...\u00a0...However, we also have the following....\u00a0...Therefore, if a differential equation is exact and ... meets all of its continuity conditions we must have....\u00a0...Likewise if ... is not true there is no way for the differential equation to be exact....\u00a0...Therefore, we will use ... as a test for exact differential equations.\u00a0 If ... is true we will assume that the differential equation is exact and that ... meets all of its continuity conditions and proceed with finding it.\u00a0 Note that for all the examples here the continuity conditions will be met and so this won\u2019t be an issue....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s go back and rework the first example.\u00a0 This time we will use the example to show how to find ...\u00a0 We\u2019ll also add in an initial condition to the problem. ...\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP and find the interval of validity for the solution....First identify ...   and ... and check that the   differential equation is exact....\u00a0...So, the differential equation is exact according to the   test.\u00a0 However, we already knew that as   we have given you ....\u00a0   It\u2019s not a bad thing to verify it however and to run through the test   at least once however....\u00a0...Now, how do we actually find ...?\u00a0   Well recall that...\u00a0...We can use either of these to get a start on finding ... by integrating as follows....\u00a0...However, we will need to be careful as this won\u2019t give us   the exact function that we need. Often it doesn\u2019t matter which one you choose   to work with while in other problems one will be significantly easier than   the other.\u00a0 In this case it doesn\u2019t   matter which one we use as either will be just as easy....\u00a0...So, I\u2019ll use the first one....\u00a0...Note that in this case the \u201cconstant\u201d of integration is   not really a constant at all, but instead it will be a function of the   remaining variable(s), ... in this   case.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Recall that in integration we are asking what function we   differentiated to get the function we are integrating.\u00a0 Since we are working with two variables   here and talking about partial differentiation with respect to ..., this means that any term that   contained only constants or ...\u2019s   would have differentiated away to zero, therefore we need to acknowledge that   fact by adding on a function of ...   instead of the standard .......\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve got most of ... we just need to determine ... and we\u2019ll be done.\u00a0 This is actually easy to do.\u00a0 We used ...\u00a0to find most of ... so we\u2019ll use ...\u00a0to find ....\u00a0 Differentiate our ... with respect to ... and set this equal to ... (since they must be equal after   all).\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to \u201cdifferentiate\u201d ...!\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0...From this we can see that...\u00a0...Note that at this stage ... must be only a function of ... and so if there are any ...\u2019s   in the equation at this stage we have made a mistake somewhere and it\u2019s time   to go look for it.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We can now find ...   by integrating....\u00a0...You\u2019ll note that we included the constant of integration, ..., here.\u00a0 It will turn out however that this will end   up getting absorbed into another constant so we can drop it in general....\u00a0...So, we can now write down .......\u00a0...With the exception of the ... this is identical to the function that we used in the first   example.\u00a0 We can now go straight to the   implicit solution using .......\u00a0...We\u2019ll now take care of the ....\u00a0 Since both ... and ... are unknown constants all we need to do is subtract one from   both sides and combine and we still have an unknown constant....\u00a0...Therefore, we\u2019ll not include the ... in anymore problems....\u00a0...This is where we left off in the first example.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now apply the initial condition to   find .......\u00a0...The implicit solution is then....\u00a0...Now, as we saw in the separable differential equation   section, this is quadratic in ... and   so we can solve for ... by using   the quadratic formula....\u00a0...Now, reapply the initial condition to figure out which of   the two signs in the ...\u00a0that we need....\u00a0...So, it looks like the \u201c-\u201d is the one that we need.\u00a0 The explicit solution is then....\u00a0...Now, for the interval of validity.\u00a0 It looks like we might well have problems   with square roots of negative numbers.\u00a0   So, we need to solve...\u00a0...Upon solving this equation is zero at ... = ...11.81557624   and ... = ...1.396911133.\u00a0 Note that you\u2019ll need to use some form of   computational aid in solving this equation.\u00a0   Here is a graph of the polynomial under the radical....\u00a0...So, it looks like there are two intervals where the   polynomial will be positive....\u00a0...However, recall that intervals of validity need to be   continuous intervals and contain the value of ... that is used in the initial condition.\u00a0 Therefore the interval of validity must be....\u00a0...Here is a quick graph of the solution....\u00a0...That was a long example, but mostly because of the initial explanation of how to find ....\u00a0 The remaining examples will not be as long....\u00a0...Find   the solution and interval of validity for the following IVP....\u00a0...Here, we first need to put the differential equation into   proper form before proceeding.\u00a0 Recall   that it needs to be \u201c= 0\u201d and the sign separating the two terms must be a   plus!...\u00a0...So we have the following...and so the differential equation is exact.\u00a0 We can either integrate ... with respect to ... or integrate ... with   respect to ....\u00a0 In this case either would be just as easy   so we\u2019ll integrate ... this time so   we can say that we\u2019ve got an example of both down here....\u00a0...This time, as opposed to the previous example, our   \u201cconstant\u201d of integration must be a function of ... since we integrated with respect to ...\u00a0 Now differentiate with   respect to ... and compare this to .......\u00a0...So, it looks like...\u00a0...Again, we\u2019ll drop the constant of integration that   technically should be present in ...   since it will just get absorbed into the constant we pick up in the next   step.\u00a0 Also note that, ... should only involve ...\u2019s at this point.\u00a0 If there are any ...\u2019s left at this point a mistake has been made so go back and   look for it....\u00a0...Writing everything down gives us the following for .......\u00a0...So, the implicit solution to the differential equation is...\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives,...\u00a0...The solution is then...\u00a0...Using the quadratic formula gives us...\u00a0...Reapplying the initial condition shows that this time we   need the \u201c+\u201d (we\u2019ll leave those details to you to check).\u00a0 Therefore, the explicit solution is...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s find the interval of validity.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to avoid ... = 0 so we don\u2019t get division by zero.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also have to watch out for square   roots of negative numbers so solve the following equation....\u00a0...The only real solution here is ... = 3.217361577.\u00a0 Below is   a graph of the polynomial....\u00a0...So, it looks like the polynomial will be positive, and   hence okay under the square root on ...\u00a0...Now, this interval can\u2019t be the interval of validity   because it contains ... = 0 and we   need to avoid that point.\u00a0 Therefore,   this interval actually breaks up into two different possible intervals of   validity....\u00a0...The first one contains ...   = -1, the ... value from the initial   condition.\u00a0 Therefore, the interval of   validity for this problem is ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a graph of the solution....\u00a0...Find   the solution and interval of validity to the following IVP....So, first deal with that minus sign separating the two   terms....\u00a0...Now, find ... and ... and check that it\u2019s exact....\u00a0...So, it\u2019s exact.\u00a0   We\u2019ll integrate the first one in this case....\u00a0...Differentiate with respect to ... and compare to .......\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got....\u00a0...This gives us...\u00a0...The implicit solution is then,...\u00a0...Applying the initial condition gives,...\u00a0...The implicit solution is now,...\u00a0...This solution is much easier to solve than the previous   ones.\u00a0 No quadratic formula is needed   this time, all we need to do is solve for ....\u00a0\u00a0 Here\u2019s what we get for an explicit   solution....\u00a0...Alright, let\u2019s get the interval of validity.\u00a0 The term in the logarithm is always   positive so we don\u2019t need to worry about negative numbers in that.\u00a0 We do need to worry about division by zero   however.\u00a0 We will need to avoid the   following point(s)....\u00a0...We now have three possible intervals of validity....\u00a0...The last one contains ...   = 5 and so is the interval of validity for this problem is ....\u00a0 Here\u2019s a graph of the solution....\u00a0...Find   the solution and interval of validity for the following IVP....\u00a0...Let\u2019s identify ...   and ... and check that it\u2019s exact....\u00a0...So, it\u2019s exact.\u00a0   With the proper simplification integrating the second one isn\u2019t too   bad.\u00a0 ...However, the first is already set up for easy integration   so let\u2019s do that one....\u00a0...Differentiate with respect to ... and compare to .......\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got...\u00a0...Recall that actually ..., but we drop the ... because   it will get absorbed in the next step.\u00a0   That gives us ... 0.\u00a0 Therefore, we get....\u00a0...The implicit solution is then...\u00a0...Apply the initial condition....\u00a0...The implicit solution is then...\u00a0...This is as far as we can go.\u00a0

section we are now going to turn things around.\u00a0 We now want to ask what function we differentiated to get the function ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example to get us started....\u00a0...What   function did we differentiate to get the following function....Let\u2019s actually start by getting the derivative of this   function to help us see how we\u2019re going to have to approach this problem.\u00a0 The derivative of this function is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The point of this was to remind us of how differentiation   works.\u00a0 When differentiating powers of ... we multiply the term by the original   exponent and then drop the exponent by one....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s go back and work the problem.\u00a0 In fact let\u2019s just start with the first   term.\u00a0 We got ... by differentiating a function and since we drop the   exponent by one it looks like we must have differentiated ....\u00a0 However, if we had differentiated ... we would have ... and we don\u2019t have a 5   in front our first term, so the 5 needs to cancel out after we\u2019ve   differentiated.\u00a0 It looks then like we   would have to differentiate ...\u00a0in order to get .......\u00a0...Likewise for the second term, in order to get ... after differentiating we would have   to differentiate ....\u00a0 Again, the fraction is there to cancel out   the 2 we pick up in the differentiation....\u00a0...The third term is just a constant and we know that if we   differentiate ... we get 1.\u00a0 So, it looks like we had to differentiate   -9... to get the last term....\u00a0...Putting all of this together gives the following function,...\u00a0...Our answer is easy enough to check.\u00a0 Simply differentiate .......\u00a0...So, it looks like we got the correct function.\u00a0 Or did we?\u00a0   We know that the derivative of a constant is zero and so any of the   following will also give ...\u00a0upon differentiating....\u00a0...\u00a0...In fact, any function of the form,...\u00a0...will give ...\u00a0upon differentiating....\u00a0...There were two points to this last example.\u00a0 The first point was to get you thinking about how to do these problems.\u00a0 It is important initially to remember that we are really just asking what we differentiated to get the given function....\u00a0...The other point is to recognize that there are actually an infinite number of functions that we could use and they will all differ by a constant....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve worked an example let\u2019s get some of the definitions and terminology out of the way....\u00a0...Given a function, ...,   an ... of ...\u00a0is any function ...\u00a0such that...\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is any anti-derivative of ...\u00a0then the most general anti-derivative of ...\u00a0is called an ... and denoted,...\u00a0...\u00a0...In this definition the ...is called the ...,\u00a0 ...\u00a0is called the ..., ... is called   the ... and the \u201c...\u201d is called the .......\u00a0...Note that often we will just say integral instead of indefinite integral (or definite integral for that matter when we get to those).\u00a0 It will be clear from the context of the problem that we are talking about an indefinite integral (or definite integral)....\u00a0...The process of finding the indefinite integral is called ... or ....\u00a0 If we need to be specific about the integration variable we will say that we are .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s rework the first problem in light of the new terminology....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following indefinite integral....\u00a0...Since this is really asking for the most general   anti-derivative we just need to reuse the final answer from the first   example....\u00a0...The indefinite integral is,...\u00a0...A couple of warnings are now in order.\u00a0 One of the more common mistakes that students make with integrals (both indefinite and definite) is to drop the ... at the end of the integral.\u00a0 This is required!\u00a0 Think of the integral sign and the ...as a set of parentheses.\u00a0 You already know and are probably quite comfortable with the idea that every time you open a parenthesis you must close it.\u00a0 With integrals, think of the integral sign as an \u201copen parenthesis\u201d and the ... as a \u201cclose parenthesis\u201d....\u00a0...If you drop the ... it won\u2019t be clear where the integrand ends.\u00a0 Consider the following variations of the above example....\u00a0...You only integrate what is between the integral sign and the ....\u00a0 Each of the above integrals end in a different place and so we get different answers because we integrate a different number of terms each time.\u00a0 In the second integral the \u201c-9\u201d is outside the integral and so is left alone and not integrated.\u00a0 Likewise, in the third integral the \u201c ...\u201d is outside the integral and so is left alone....\u00a0...Knowing which terms to integrate is not the only reason for writing the ... down.\u00a0 In the ... section we will actually be working with the ... in the problem and if we aren\u2019t in the habit of writing it down it will be easy to forget about it and then we will get the wrong answer at that stage....\u00a0...The moral of this is to make sure and put in the ...!\u00a0 At this stage it may seem like a silly thing to do, but it just needs to be there, if for no other reason than knowing where the integral stops....\u00a0...On a side note, the ... notation should seem a little familiar to you.\u00a0 We saw things like this a couple of sections ago.\u00a0 We called the ... a ... in that section and yes that is exactly what it is.\u00a0 The ... that ends the integral is nothing more than a differential....\u00a0...The next topic that we should discuss here is the integration variable used in the integral.\u00a0 Actually there isn\u2019t really a lot to discuss here other than to note that the integration variable doesn\u2019t really matter.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Changing the integration variable in the integral simply changes the variable in the answer.\u00a0 It is important to notice however that when we change the integration variable in the integral we also changed the differential (..., ..., or ...) to match the new variable.\u00a0 This is more important that we might realize at this point....\u00a0...Another use of the differential at the end of integral is to tell us what variable we are integrating with respect to.\u00a0 At this stage that may seem unimportant since most of the integrals that we\u2019re going to be working with here will only involve a single variable.\u00a0 However, if you are on a degree track that will take you into multi-variable calculus this will be very important at that stage since there will be more than one variable in the problem.\u00a0 You need to get into the habit of writing the correct differential at the end of the integral so when it becomes important in those classes you will already be in the habit of writing it down....\u00a0...To see why this is important take a look at the following two integrals....\u00a0...The first integral is simple enough....\u00a0...The second integral is also fairly simple, but we need to be careful.\u00a0 The ... tells us that we are integrating ...\u2019s.\u00a0 That means that we only integrate ...\u2019s that are in the integrand and all other variables in the integrand are considered to be constants.\u00a0 The second integral is then,...\u00a0...So, it may seem silly to always put in the ..., but it is a vital bit of notation that can cause us to get the incorrect answer if we neglect to put it in....\u00a0...Now, there are some important properties of integrals that we should take a look at....\u00a0...1....\u00a0where ...   is any number.\u00a0 So, we can factor   multiplicative constants out of indefinite integrals.\u00a0 ...   ...   See the ... section of the Extras chapter to see the proof of this   property.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...2.....\u00a0 This is really the first property with ...\u00a0and so no proof of this property will be   given....\u00a0...3.....\u00a0 In other words, the integral of a sum or   difference of functions is the sum or difference of the individual   integrals.\u00a0 This rule can be extended   to as many functions as we need.\u00a0 ...   ...   See the ... section of the Extras chapter to see the proof of this   property.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that when we worked the first example above we used the first and third property in the discussion.\u00a0 We integrated each term individually, put any constants back in and then put everything back together with the appropriate sign....\u00a0...Not listed in the properties above were integrals of products and quotients.\u00a0 The reason for this is simple.\u00a0 Just like with derivatives each of the following will NOT work....\u00a0...\u00a0...With derivatives we had a product rule and a quotient rule to deal with these cases.\u00a0 However, with integrals there are no such rules.\u00a0 When faced with a product and quotient in an integral we will have a variety of ways of dealing with it depending on just what the integrand is....\u00a0...There is one final topic to be discussed briefly in this section.\u00a0 On occasion we will be given ...\u00a0and will ask what ...\u00a0was.\u00a0 We can now answer this question easily with an indefinite integral....\u00a0...If   ...\u00a0what was ...?...By this point in this section this is a simple question to   answer....\u00a0...In this section we kept evaluating the same indefinite integral in all of our examples.\u00a0 The point of this section was not to do indefinite integrals, but instead to get us familiar with the notation and some of the basic ideas and properties of indefinite integrals.\u00a0 The next couple of sections are devoted to actually evaluating indefinite integrals.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/IndefiniteIntegrals.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Indefinite Integrals", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "This topic is given its own section for a couple of reasons.\u00a0 First, understanding direction fields and what they tell us about a differential equation and its solution is important and can be introduced without any knowledge of how to solve a differential equation and so can be done here before we get into solving them.\u00a0 So, having some information about the solution to a differential equation without actually having the solution is a nice idea that needs some investigation....\u00a0...Next, since we need a differential equation to work with this is a good section to show you that differential equations occur naturally in many cases and how we get them.\u00a0 Almost every physical situation that occurs in nature can be described with an appropriate differential equation.\u00a0 The differential equation may be easy or difficult to arrive at depending on the situation and the assumptions that are made about the situation and we may not ever be able to solve it, however it will exist.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...One of the simplest physical situations to think of is a falling object.\u00a0 So let\u2019s consider a falling object with mass ... and derive a differential equation that, when solved, will give us the velocity of the object at any time, ....\u00a0 We will assume that only gravity and air resistance will act upon the object as it falls.\u00a0 Below is a figure showing the forces that will act upon the object....\u00a0...Before defining all the terms in this problem we need to set some conventions.\u00a0 We will assume that forces acting in the downward direction are positive forces while forces that act in the upward direction are negative.\u00a0 Likewise, we will assume that an object moving downward (... a falling object) will have a positive velocity....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at the forces shown in the diagram above.\u00a0 ...\u00a0is the force due to gravity and is given by ...where ... is the acceleration due to gravity.\u00a0 In this class I use ... = 9.8 m/s... or ... = 32 ft/s... depending on whether we will use the metric or British system.\u00a0 ...is the force due to air resistance and for this example we will assume that it is proportional to the velocity, ..., of the mass.\u00a0 Therefore the force due to air resistance is then given by..., where ....\u00a0 Note that the \u201c...\u201d is required to get the correct sign on the force.\u00a0 Both ...\u00a0and ... are positive and the force is acting upward and hence must be negative.\u00a0 The \u201c...\u201d will give us the correct sign and hence direction for this force....Recall from the previous section that ... of motion can be written as...where ... is the sum of forces that act on the object and may be a function of the time ... and the velocity of the object, ....\u00a0 For our situation we will have two forces acting on the object gravity, .... acting in the downward direction and hence will be positive, and air resistance, ... acting in the upward direction and hence will be negative.\u00a0 Putting all of this together into ...\u2019s Second Law gives the following....\u00a0...To simplify the differential equation let\u2019s divide out the mass, .......\u00a0...This then is a first order linear differential equation that, when solved, will give the velocity, ... (in m/s), of a falling object of mass ... that has both gravity and air resistance acting upon it....\u00a0...In order to look at direction fields (that is after all the topic of this section....) it would be helpful to have some numbers for the various quantities in the differential equation. So, let\u2019s assume that we have a mass of 2 kg and that ...\u00a0= 0.392. Plugging this into ... gives the following differential equation....\u00a0...Let's take a geometric view of this differential equation. Let's suppose that for some time, ..., the velocity just happens to be\u00a0 ...= 30 m/s.\u00a0 Note that we\u2019re not saying that the velocity ever will be 30 m/s.\u00a0 All that we\u2019re saying is that let\u2019s suppose that by some chance the velocity does happen to be 30 m/s at some time ....\u00a0 So, if the velocity does happen to be 30 m/s at some time ... we can plug ... = 30 into ... to get....\u00a0...Recall from your Calculus I course that a positive derivative means that the function in question, the velocity in this case, is increasing, so if the velocity of this object is ever 30m/s for any time ... the velocity must be increasing at that time. ...\u00a0...Also, recall that the value of the derivative at a particular value of ... gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that time, .... \u00a0So, if for some time ... the velocity happens to be 30 m/s the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the velocity is 3.92....\u00a0...We could continue in this fashion and pick different values of ... and compute the slope of the tangent line for those values of the velocity. However, let's take a slightly more organized approach to this. Let's first identify the values of the velocity that will have zero slope or horizontal tangent lines. These are easy enough to find. All we need to do is set the derivative equal to zero and solve for .......\u00a0...In the case of our example we will have only one value of the velocity which will have horizontal tangent lines, .... What this means is that IF (again, there\u2019s that word if), for some time ..., the velocity happens to be 50 m/s then the tangent line at that point will be horizontal. What the slope of the tangent line is at times before and after this point is not known yet and has no bearing on the slope at this particular time, .... ...\u00a0...So, if we have ..., we know that the tangent lines will be horizontal. We denote this on an axis system with horizontal arrows pointing in the direction of increasing ... at the level of ... as shown in the following figure....\u00a0...Now, let's get some tangent lines and hence arrows for our graph for some other values of .... At this point the only exact slope that is useful to us is where the slope horizontal. So instead of going after exact slopes for the rest of the graph we are only going to go after general trends in the slope. Is the slope increasing or decreasing? How fast is the slope increasing or decreasing?\u00a0 For this example those types of trends are very easy to get....\u00a0...First, notice that the right hand side of ... is a polynomial and hence continuous. This means that it can only change sign if it first goes through zero. So, if the derivative will change signs (no guarantees that it will) it will do so at .... This means that for ... the slope of the tangent lines to the velocity will have the same sign. Likewise, for ... the slopes will also have the same sign.\u00a0 The slopes in these ranges may have (and probably will) have different values, but we do know what their signs must be....\u00a0...Let's start by looking at .... We saw earlier that if ... the slope of the tangent line will be 3.92, or positive. Therefore, for all values of ... we will have positive slopes for the tangent lines. Also, by looking at ... we can see that as ... approaches 50, always staying less than 50, the slopes of the tangent lines will approach zero and hence flatten out. If we move ... away from 50, staying less than 50, the slopes of the tangent lines will become steeper. If you want to get an idea of just how steep the tangent lines become you can always pick specific values of ... and compute values of the derivative. For instance, we know that at ... the derivative is 3.92 and so arrows at this point should have a slope of around 4. Using this information we can now add in some arrows for the region below ... as shown in the graph below....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s look at .... The first thing to do is to find out if the slopes are positive or negative. We will do this the same way that we did in the last bit, ... pick a value of ..., plug this into ... and see if the derivative is positive or negative. Note, that you should NEVER assume that the derivative will change signs where the derivative is zero. It is easy enough to check so you should always do so....\u00a0...We need to check the derivative so let's use .... Plugging this into ... gives the slope of the tangent line as -1.96, or negative. Therefore, for all values of ... we will have negative slopes for the tangent lines. As with ... < 50, by looking at ... we can see that as ... approaches 50, always staying greater than 50, the slopes of the tangent lines will approach zero and flatten out. While moving ... away from 50 again, staying greater than 50, the slopes of the tangent lines will become steeper. We can now add in some arrows for the region above ... as shown in the graph below....\u00a0...This graph above is called the ... for the differential equation. ...\u00a0...So, just why do we care about direction fields? There are two nice pieces of information that can be readily found from the direction field for a differential equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, back to the direction field for our differential equation. Suppose that we want to know what the solution that has the value ... looks like. We can go to our direction field and start at 30 on the vertical axis. At this point we know that the solution is increasing and that as it increases the solution should flatten out because the velocity will be approaching the value of .... So we start drawing an increasing solution and when we hit an arrow we just make sure that we stay parallel to that arrow. This gives us the figure below....\u00a0...To get a better idea of how all the solutions are behaving, let's put a few more solutions in. Adding some more solutions gives the figure below. The set of solutions that we've graphed below is often called the ... or the set of .... The number of solutions that is plotted when plotting the integral curves varies. You should graph enough solution curves to illustrate how solutions in all portions of the direction field are behaving....\u00a0...Now, from either the direction field, or the direction field with the solution curves sketched in we can see the behavior of the solution as ... increases.\u00a0 For our falling object, it looks like all of the solutions will approach ... = 50 as ... increases....\u00a0...We will often want to know if the behavior of the solution will depend on the value of ...(0).\u00a0 In this case the behavior of the solution will not depend on the value of ...(0), but that is probably more of the exception than the rule so don\u2019t expect that....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a more complicated example....\u00a0...Sketch   the direction field for the following differential equation. Sketch the set   of integral curves for this differential equation. Determine how the   solutions behave as ...\u00a0and if this behavior depends on the value of   ...   describe this dependency....First, do not worry about where this differential equation   came from.\u00a0 To be honest, we just made   it up.\u00a0 It may, or may not describe an   actual physical situation....\u00a0...This differential equation looks somewhat more complicated   than the falling object example from above. However, with the exception of a   little more work, it is not much more complicated. The first step is to   determine where the derivative is zero....\u00a0...We can now see that we have three values of ... in which the   derivative, and hence the slope of tangent lines, will be zero. The   derivative will be zero at .... So, let's start our direction field with   drawing horizontal tangents for these values. This is shown in the figure   below....\u00a0...Now, we need to add arrows to the four regions that the   graph is now divided into. For each of these regions I will pick a value of ... in that region and   plug it into the right hand side of the differential equation to see if the   derivative is positive or negative in that region. Again, to get an accurate   direction fields you should pick a few more values over the whole range   to see how the arrows are behaving over the whole range....\u00a0...   In this region we can use ... as the test point. At this point we have ....\u00a0 So, tangent lines in this region will have   very steep and positive slopes. Also as ...\u00a0the slopes will flatten out while staying   positive. The figure below shows the direction fields with arrows in this   region....\u00a0...In this region we can use ... as the test point.   At this point we have ....\u00a0 Therefore, tangent lines in this region will   have negative slopes and apparently not be very steep. So what do the arrows   look like in this region? As ...\u00a0staying less than 1 of course, the slopes   should be negative and approach zero. As we move away from 1 and towards -1 the   slopes will start to get steeper (and stay negative), but eventually flatten   back out, again staying negative, as ...\u00a0since the derivative must approach zero at   that point. The figure below shows the direction fields with arrows added to   this region....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...In this region we will use ... as the test   point. At this point we have ....\u00a0 Tangent lines in this region will also have   negative slopes and apparently not be as steep as the previous region. Arrows   in this region will behave essentially the same as those in the previous   region. Near ... = 1 and ... = 2 the slopes will flatten out and   as we move from one to the other the slopes will get somewhat steeper before   flattening back out. The figure below shows the direction fields with arrows   added to this region....\u00a0...In this last region we will use ... as the test point.   At this point we have ....\u00a0 So, as we saw in the first region tangent   lines will start out fairly flat near ...   = 2 and then as we move way from ...   = 2 they will get fairly steep....\u00a0...The complete direction field for this differential   equation is shown below....\u00a0...Here is the set of integral curves for this differential   equation. Note that due to the steepness of the solutions in the lowest   region and the software used to generate these images I was unable to include   more than one solution curve in this region...Finally, let's take a look at long term behavior of all   solutions.\u00a0 Unlike the first example,   the long term behavior in this case will depend on the value of ... at ....   By examining either of the previous two figures we can arrive at the   following behavior of solutions as ...\u00a0...Do not forget to acknowledge what the horizontal   solutions are doing.\u00a0 This is often the   most missed portion of this kind of problem....In both of the examples that we've worked to this point the right hand side of the derivative has only contained the function and NOT the independent variable. When the right hand side of the differential equation contains both the function and the independent variable the behavior can be much more complicated and sketching the direction fields by hand can be very difficult. Computer software is very handy in these cases....\u00a0...In some cases they aren\u2019t too difficult to do by hand however.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at the following example....\u00a0...Sketch   the direction field for the following differential equation. Sketch the set   of integral curves for this differential equation....To sketch direction fields for this kind of differential   equation we first identify places where the derivative will be constant. To   do this we set the derivative in the differential equation equal to a   constant, say ....   This gives us a family of equations, called ...,   that we can plot and on each of these curves the derivative will be a   constant value of .......\u00a0...Notice that in the previous examples we looked at the   isocline for ... to get the direction field started. For our case the family   of isoclines is. ...\u00a0...Now, on each of these lines, or isoclines, the derivative   will be constant and will have a value of .... On the ... isocline the   derivative will always have a value of zero and hence the tangents will all   be horizontal. On the ... isocline the tangents will always have a slope of 1, on the   ... isocline the tangents will always have a slope of -2, ... Below are a few tangents put in for each   of these isoclines....\u00a0...\u00a0...To add more arrows for those areas between the isoclines   start at say, ... and move up to ... and as we do that we increase the slope of the arrows   (tangents) from 0 to 1.

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "The first special case of first order differential equations that we will look is the linear first order differential equation. In this case, unlike most of the first order cases that we will look at, we can actually derive a formula for the general solution. The general solution is derived below. \u00a0However, I would suggest that you do not memorize the formula itself. Instead of memorizing the formula you should memorize and understand the process that I'm going to use to derive the formula. Most problems are actually easier to work by using the process instead of using the formula....\u00a0...So, let's see how to solve a linear first order differential equation. Remember as we go through this process that the goal is to arrive at a solution that is in the form ....\u00a0 It's sometimes easy to lose sight of the goal as we go through this process for the first time....\u00a0...In order to solve a linear first order differential equation we MUST start with the differential equation in the form shown below. If the differential equation is not in this form then the process we\u2019re going to use will not work....\u00a0...Where both ... and ... are ... functions.\u00a0 Recall that a quick and dirty definition of a continuous function is that a function will be continuous provided you can draw the graph from left to right without ever picking up your pencil/pen.\u00a0 In other words, a function is continuous if there are no holes or breaks in it....\u00a0...Now, we are going to assume that there is some magical function somewhere out there in the world, ..., called an .... Do not, at this point, worry about what this function is or where it came from. We will figure out what ...is once we have the formula for the general solution in hand. ...\u00a0...So, now that we have assumed the existence of ...\u00a0multiply everything in ... by .... This will give. ...\u00a0...Now, this is where the magic of ...\u00a0comes into play. We are going to assume that whatever ...\u00a0is, it will satisfy the following. ...\u00a0...Again do not worry about how we can find a ...\u00a0that will satisfy .... As we will see, provided ... is continuous we can find it. So substituting ... into ... we now arrive at....\u00a0...At this point we need to recognize that the left side of ... is nothing more than the following product rule....\u00a0...So we can replace the left side of \u00a0... with this product rule. Upon doing this ... becomes...\u00a0...Now, recall that we are after ....\u00a0 We can now do something about that.\u00a0 All we need to do is integrate both sides then use a little algebra and we'll have the solution. So, integrate both sides of ... to get....\u00a0...Note the constant of integration, ..., from the left side integration is included here. It is vitally important that this be included. If it is left out you will get the wrong answer every time....\u00a0...The final step is then some algebra to solve for the solution, .......\u00a0...Now, from a notational standpoint we know that the constant of integration, ..., is an unknown constant and so to make our life easier we will absorb the minus sign in front of it into the constant and use a plus instead. This will NOT affect the final answer for the solution. So with this change we have....\u00a0...Again, changing the sign on the constant will not affect our answer.\u00a0 If you choose to keep the minus sign you will get the same value of ... as I do except it will have the opposite sign.\u00a0 Upon plugging in ... we will get exactly the same answer....\u00a0...There is a lot of playing fast and loose with constants of integration in this section, so you will need to get used to it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When we do this we will always to try to make it very clear what is going on and try to justify why we did what we did....\u00a0...So, now that we\u2019ve got a general solution to ... we need to go back and determine just what this magical function ...\u00a0is. \u00a0This is actually an easier process than you might think.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with .......\u00a0...Divide both sides by ...,...\u00a0...Now, hopefully you will recognize the left side of this from your Calculus I class as nothing more than the following derivative....\u00a0...As with the process above all we need to do is integrate both sides to get....\u00a0...You will notice that the constant of integration from the left side, ..., had been moved to the right side and had the minus sign absorbed into it again as we did earlier.\u00a0 Also note that we\u2019re using ... here because we\u2019ve already used ... and in a little bit we\u2019ll have both of them in the same equation.\u00a0 So, to avoid confusion we used different letters to represent the fact that they will, in all probability, have different values....\u00a0...Exponentiate both sides to get ...out of the natural logarithm. ...\u00a0...Now, it\u2019s time to play fast and loose with constants again.\u00a0 It is inconvenient to have the ... in the exponent so we\u2019re going to get it out of the exponent in the following way....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s make use of the fact that ... is an unknown constant.\u00a0 If ... is an unknown constant then so is ...\u00a0so we might as well just rename it ... and make our life easier.\u00a0 This will give us the following....\u00a0...So, we now have a formula for the general solution, ..., and a formula for the integrating factor, ....\u00a0 We do have a problem however.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got two unknown constants and the more unknown constants we have the more trouble we\u2019ll have later on.\u00a0 Therefore, it would be nice if we could find a way to eliminate one of them (we\u2019ll not be able to eliminate both\u2026.).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is actually quite easy to do.\u00a0 First, substitute ... into ... and rearrange the constants....\u00a0...So, ... can be written in such a way that the only place the two unknown constants show up is a ratio of the two.\u00a0 Then since both ... and ... are unknown constants so is the ratio of the two constants.\u00a0 Therefore we\u2019ll just call the ratio ... and then drop ... out of ... since it will just get absorbed into ... eventually....\u00a0...The solution to a linear first order differential equation is then...where,...\u00a0...Now, the reality is that ... is not as useful as it may seem.\u00a0 It is often easier to just run through the process that got us to ... rather than using the formula.\u00a0 We will not use this formula in any of my examples.\u00a0 We will need to use ... regularly, as that formula is easier to use than the process to derive it....\u00a0...The solution process for a first order linear differential equation is as follows....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start by solving the differential equation that we derived back in the ... section....\u00a0...Find   the solution to the following differential equation....\u00a0...First we need to get the differential equation in the   correct form....\u00a0...From this we can see that ... and so ...\u00a0is then....\u00a0...Note that officially there should be a constant of   integration in the exponent from the integration.\u00a0 However, we can drop that for exactly the   same reason that we dropped the ...   from .......\u00a0...Now multiply all the terms in the differential equation by   the integrating factor and do some simplification....\u00a0...Integrate both sides and don't forget the constants of   integration that will arise from both integrals....\u00a0...Okay.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to   play with constants again.\u00a0 We can   subtract ... from both sides to get....\u00a0...Both ... and ... are unknown constants and so the   difference is also an unknown constant.\u00a0   We will therefore write the difference as ....\u00a0 So, we now have...\u00a0...From this point on we will only put one constant of   integration down when we integrate both sides knowing that if we had written   down one for each integral, as we should, the two would just end up getting   absorbed into each other....\u00a0...The final step in the solution process is then to divide   both sides by ...\u00a0or to multiply both sides by ....\u00a0 Either will work, but I usually prefer the multiplication   route.\u00a0 Doing this gives the general   solution to the differential equation....\u00a0...From the solution to this example we can now see why the constant of integration is so important in this process. Without it, in this case, we would get a single, constant solution, .... With the constant of integration we get infinitely many solutions, one for each value of .......\u00a0...Back in the ... section where we first derived the differential equation used in the last example we used the direction field to help us sketch some solutions. Let's see if we got them correct. To sketch some solutions all we need to do is to pick different values of ... to get a solution. Several of these are shown in the graph below....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it looks like we did pretty good sketching the graphs back in the direction field section....\u00a0...Now, recall from the Definitions section that the ... will allow us to zero in on a particular solution.\u00a0 Solutions to first order differential equations (not just linear as we will see) will have a single unknown constant in them and so we will need exactly one initial condition to find the value of that constant and hence find the solution that we were after.\u00a0 The initial condition for first order differential equations will be of the form...\u00a0...Recall as well that a differential equation along with a sufficient number of initial conditions is called an ... (IVP)....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP. ...To find the solution to an IVP we must first find the   general solution to the differential equation and then use the initial   condition to identify the exact solution that we are after. So, since this is   the same differential equation as we looked at in Example 1... we already have its general solution....\u00a0...Now, to find the solution we are after we need to identify   the value of ...   that will give us the solution we are after. To do this we simply plug in the   initial condition which will give us an equation we can solve for .... So let's do this...\u00a0...So, the actual solution to the IVP is....\u00a0...A graph of this solution can be seen in the figure above....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a couple of examples that are a little more involved....\u00a0...Solve   the following IVP....Rewrite the differential equation to get the coefficient   of the derivative a one....\u00a0...Now find the integrating factor....\u00a0...Can you do the integral?\u00a0   If not rewrite tangent back into sines and cosines and then use a   simple substitution.\u00a0 Note that we   could drop the absolute value bars on the secant because of the limits on ....\u00a0   In fact, this is the reason for the limits on .......\u00a0...Also note that we made use of the following fact....\u00a0...This is an important fact that you should always remember   for these problems.\u00a0 We will want to   simplify the integrating factor as much as possible in all cases and this   fact will help with that simplification....\u00a0...Now back to the example.\u00a0   Multiply the integrating factor through the differential equation and   verify the left side is a product rule.\u00a0   Note as well that we multiply the integrating factor through the   rewritten differential equation and NOT the original differential   equation.\u00a0 Make sure that you do   this.\u00a0 If you multiply the integrating   factor through the original differential equation you will get the wrong   solution!...\u00a0...Integrate both sides....\u00a0...Note the use of the trig formula ...\u00a0that made the integral easier.\u00a0 Next, solve for the solution....\u00a0...Finally, apply the initial condition to find the value of .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The solution is then....\u00a0...Below is a plot of the solution.... .......\u00a0...Now, we need to simplify ....\u00a0 However, we can\u2019t use ...   yet as that requires a coefficient of one in front of the logarithm.\u00a0 So, recall that ...and rewrite the integrating factor in a form that will   allow us to simplify it....\u00a0...We were able to drop the absolute value bars here because   we were squaring the ..., but often   they can\u2019t be dropped so be careful with them and don\u2019t drop them unless you   know that you can.\u00a0 Often the absolute   value bars must remain....\u00a0...Now, multiply the rewritten differential equation   (remember we can\u2019t use the original differential equation here\u2026) by the   integrating factor....\u00a0...Integrate both sides and solve for the solution....\u00a0...Finally, apply the initial condition to get the value of .......\u00a0...\u00a0...The solution is then,...\u00a0...Here is a plot of the solution....Find   the solution to the following IVP....First, divide through by ... to get the differential equation in the   correct form....\u00a0...Now that we have done this we can find the integrating   factor, .......\u00a0...Do not forget that the \u201c-\u201d is part of ....\u00a0 Forgetting this   minus sign can take a problem that is very easy to do and turn it into a very   difficult, if not impossible problem so be careful!...\u00a0...Now, we just need to simplify this as we did in the   previous example....\u00a0...Again, we can drop the absolute value bars since we are   squaring the term....\u00a0...Now multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor   (again, make sure it\u2019s the rewritten one and not the original differential   equation)....\u00a0...Integrate both sides and solve for the solution....\u00a0...Apply the initial condition to find the value of .......The solution is then...\u00a0...Below is a plot of the solution....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one final example that looks more at interpreting a solution rather than finding a solution....\u00a0...Find   the solution to the following IVP and determine all possible behaviors of the   solution as ....\u00a0 If this behavior depends on the value of ... give this dependence. ...First, divide through by a 2 to   get the differential equation in the correct form.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Now find .......\u00a0...Multiply ...through the differential equation and   rewrite the left side as a product rule....\u00a0...Integrate both sides and solve for the solution....\u00a0...Apply the initial condition to find the value of ... and note that it will contain ... as we don\u2019t have a value   for that....\u00a0...So the solution is ...\u00a0...Now that we have the solution, let\u2019s look at the long term   behavior (...) of the solution.\u00a0 The first two terms of the solution will   remain finite for all values of ....\u00a0 It is the last term that will determine the   behavior of the solution.\u00a0 The   exponential will always go to infinity as ...,   however depending on the sign of the coefficient ...

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the final section of this chapter let\u2019s take a look at some applications of derivatives in the business world.\u00a0 For the most part these are really applications that we\u2019ve already looked at, but they are now going to be approached with an eye towards the business world. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start things out with a couple of optimization problems.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already looked at more than a few of these in previous sections so there really isn\u2019t anything all that new here except for the fact that they are coming out of the business world....\u00a0...An   apartment complex has 250 apartments to rent.\u00a0   If they rent ... apartments   then their monthly profit, in dollars, is given by,...\u00a0...How many apartments should they rent in order to maximize   their profit?...\u00a0...All that we\u2019re really being asked to do here is to   maximize the profit subject to the constraint that ... must be in the range ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, we\u2019ll need the derivative and the critical point(s)   that fall in the range .......\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Since the   profit function is continuous and we have an interval with finite bounds we   can find the maximum value by simply plugging in the only critical point that   we have (which nicely enough in the range of acceptable answers) and the end   points of the range....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, it looks   like they will generate the most profit if they only rent out 200 of the   apartments instead of all 250 of them....\u00a0...Note that with these problems you shouldn\u2019t just assume that renting all the apartments will generate the most profit.\u00a0 Do not forget that there are all sorts of maintenance costs and that the more tenants renting apartments the more the maintenance costs will be.\u00a0 With this analysis we can see that, for this complex at least, something probably needs to be done to get the maximum profit more towards full capacity.\u00a0 This kind of analysis can help them determine just what they need to do to move towards that goal whether it be raising rent or finding a way to reduce maintenance costs....\u00a0...Note as well that because most apartment complexes have at least a few units empty after a tenant moves out and the like that it\u2019s possible that they would actually like the maximum profit to fall slightly under full capacity to take this into account.\u00a0 Again, another reason to not just assume that maximum profit will always be at the upper limit of the range....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at another problem along these lines....\u00a0...A   production facility is capable of producing 60,000 widgets in a day and the   total daily cost of producing ...   widgets in a day is given by,...How many widgets per day should they produce in order to   minimize production costs?...\u00a0...Here we need to minimize the cost subject to the   constraint that ... must be in the   range ....\u00a0 Note that in this case the cost function is   not continuous at the left endpoint and so we won\u2019t be able to just plug   critical points and endpoints into the cost function to find the minimum   value....\u00a0...Let\u2019s get the first couple of derivatives of the cost   function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The critical   points of the cost function are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, clearly   the negative value doesn\u2019t make any sense in this setting and so we have a   single critical point in the range of possible solutions : 50,000....\u00a0...Now, as long as   ...\u00a0the second derivative is positive and so, in   the range of possible solutions the function is always concave up and so   producing 50,000 widgets will yield the absolute minimum production cost....\u00a0...Now, we shouldn\u2019t walk out of the previous two examples with the idea that the only applications to business are just applications we\u2019ve already looked at but with a business \u201ctwist\u201d to them.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are some very real applications to calculus that are in the business world and at some level that is the point of this section.\u00a0 Note that to really learn these applications and all of their intricacies you\u2019ll need to take a business course or two or three.\u00a0 In this section we\u2019re just going to scratch the surface and get a feel for some of the actual applications of calculus from the business world and some of the main \u201cbuzz\u201d words in the applications....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off by looking at the following example....\u00a0...The   production costs per week for producing ...   widgets is given by,...Answer each of the following questions....\u00a0...What   is the cost to produce the 301... widget?...What   is the rate of change of the cost at ...?...\u00a0...\u00a0... We can\u2019t   just compute ...\u00a0as that is the cost of producing 301 widgets   while we are looking for the actual cost of producing the 301...   widget.\u00a0 In other words, what we\u2019re   looking for here is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the cost of   producing the 301... widget is $295.91....\u00a0... In this part all we need to do is   get the derivative and then compute .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, so just what did we learn in this example?\u00a0 The cost to produce an additional item is called the ... and as we\u2019ve seen in the above example the marginal cost is approximated by the rate of change of the ..., ....\u00a0 So, we define the ... to be the derivative of the cost function or, ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s work a quick example of this....\u00a0...The   production costs per day for some widget is given by,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...What is the   marginal cost when ...,   ...\u00a0and ...?...\u00a0...So, we need the derivative and then we\u2019ll need to compute   some values of the derivative....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in order to produce the 201... widget it   will cost approximately $10.\u00a0 To   produce the 301... widget will cost around $38.\u00a0 Finally, to product the 401...   widget it will cost approximately $78....\u00a0...Note that it is important to note that ...\u00a0is the approximate cost of producing the ...\u00a0item and NOT the n... item as it may seem to imply!...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now turn our attention to the ... function.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0is the cost function for some item then the average cost function is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Here is the sketch of the average cost function from Example 4 above....\u00a0...We can see from this that the average cost function has an absolute minimum.\u00a0 We can also see that this absolute minimum will occur at a critical point with ...\u00a0since it clearly will have a horizontal tangent there.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we could get the average cost function, differentiate that and then find the critical point.\u00a0 However, this average cost function is fairly typical for average cost functions so let\u2019s instead differentiate the general formula above using the quotient rule and see what we have....\u00a0...Now, as we noted above the absolute minimum will occur when ...\u00a0and this will in turn occur when,...\u00a0...So, we can see that it looks like for a typical average cost function we will get the minimum average cost when the marginal cost is equal to the average cost....\u00a0...We should note however that not all average cost functions will look like this and so you shouldn\u2019t assume that this will always be the case. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now move onto the revenue and profit functions.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s suppose that the price that some item can be sold at if there is a demand for ... units is given by ....\u00a0 This function is typically called either the ... or the .......\u00a0...The ... is then how much money is made by selling ... items and is,...\u00a0...The ... is then,...\u00a0...Be careful to not confuse the demand function, ...\u00a0- lower case ..., and the profit function, ...\u00a0- upper case ....\u00a0 Bad notation maybe, but there it is....\u00a0...Finally, the ... is ...\u00a0and the ... is ...\u00a0and these represent the revenue and profit respectively if one more unit is sold....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example of using these....\u00a0...The   weekly cost to produce ... widgets is   given by...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and the demand   function for the widgets is given by,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Determine the marginal cost, marginal revenue and marginal   profit when 2500 widgets are sold and when 7500 widgets are sold.\u00a0 Assume that the company sells exactly what   they produce....\u00a0...Okay, the first thing we need to do is get all the various   functions that we\u2019ll need.\u00a0 Here are   the revenue and profit functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, all the   marginal functions are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...The marginal functions   when 2500 widgets are sold are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The marginal functions when 7500 are sold are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, upon producing and selling the 2501...   widget it will cost the company approximately $25 to produce the widget and   they will see an added $175 in revenue and $150 in profit....\u00a0...On the other hand when they produce and sell the 7501...   widget it will cost an additional $325 and they will receive an extra $125 in   revenue, but lose $200 in profit. ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll close this section out with a brief discussion on maximizing the profit.\u00a0 If we assume that the maximum profit will occur at a critical point such that ...\u00a0we can then say the following,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We then will know that this will be a maximum we also were to know that the profit was always concave down or,...\u00a0...So, if we know that ...\u00a0then we will maximize the profit if ...\u00a0or if the marginal cost equals the marginal revenue....\u00a0...In this section we took a brief look at some of the ideas in the business world that involve calculus.\u00a0 Again, it needs to be stressed however that there is a lot more going on here and to really see how these applications are done you should really take some business courses.\u00a0 The point of this section was to just give a few ideas on how calculus is used in a field other than the sciences.", "url":

decreasing....\u00a0...It\u2019s probably not the best way to define concavity by saying which way it \u201copens\u201d since this is a somewhat nebulous definition.\u00a0 Here is the mathematical definition of concavity....\u00a0...Given the function ...\u00a0then...\u00a0...To show that the graphs above do in fact have concavity claimed above here is the graph again (blown up a little to make things clearer)....So, as you can see, in the two upper graphs all of the tangent lines sketched in are all below the graph of the function and these are concave up.\u00a0 In the lower two graphs all the tangent lines are above the graph of the function and these are concave down.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Again, notice that concavity and the increasing/decreasing aspect of the function is completely separate and do not have anything to do with the other.\u00a0 This is important to note because students often mix these two up and use information about one to get information about the other. ...\u00a0...There\u2019s one more definition that we need to get out of the way....\u00a0...A point ...\u00a0is called an ... if the function is continuous at the point and   the concavity of the graph changes at that point....\u00a0...Now that we have all the concavity definitions out of the way we need to bring the second derivative into the mix.\u00a0 We did after all start off this section saying we were going to be using the second derivative to get information about the graph.\u00a0 The following fact relates the second derivative of a function to its concavity.\u00a0 The proof of this fact is in the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Given the function ...\u00a0then,...Notice that this fact tells us that a list of possible inflection points will be those points where the second derivative is zero or doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 Be careful however to not make the assumption that just because the second derivative is zero or doesn\u2019t exist that the point will be an inflection point.\u00a0 We will only know that it is an inflection point once we determine the concavity on both sides of it.\u00a0 It will only be an inflection point if the concavity is different on both sides of the point....\u00a0...Now that we know about concavity we can use this information as well as the increasing/decreasing information from the previous section to get a pretty good idea of what a graph should look like.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at an example of that....\u00a0...For   the following function identify the intervals where the function is   increasing and decreasing and the intervals where the function is concave up   and concave down.\u00a0 Use this information   to sketch the graph....Okay, we are going to need the first two derivatives so   let\u2019s get those first....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the increasing/decreasing information   since we should be fairly comfortable with that after the last section....\u00a0...There are three critical points for this function : ...,   ...,   and ....\u00a0 Below is the number line for the   increasing/decreasing information....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got the following intervals of   increasing and decreasing....\u00a0...Note that from the first derivative test we can also say   that ...\u00a0is a relative maximum and that ...\u00a0is a relative minimum.\u00a0 Also ...\u00a0is neither a relative minimum or maximum....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s get the intervals where the function is concave   up and concave down.\u00a0 If you think   about it this process is almost identical to the process we use to identify   the intervals of increasing and decreasing.\u00a0   This only difference is that we will be using the second derivative   instead of the first derivative....\u00a0...The first thing that we need to do is identify the   possible inflection points.\u00a0 These will   be where the second derivative is zero or doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 The second derivative in this case is a   polynomial and so will exist everywhere.\u00a0   It will be zero at the following points....\u00a0...As with the increasing and decreasing part we can draw a   number line up and use these points to divide the number line into   regions.\u00a0 In these regions we know that   the second derivative will always have the same sign since these three   points are the only places where the function ... change sign.\u00a0   Therefore, all that we need to do is pick a point from each region and   plug it into the second derivative.\u00a0   The second derivative will then have that sign in the whole region   from which the point came from...\u00a0...Here is the number line for this second derivative....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got the following intervals of   concavity....\u00a0...This also means that ...are all inflection points....\u00a0...All this information can be a little overwhelming when   going to sketch the graph.\u00a0 The first   thing that we should do is get some starting points.\u00a0 The critical points and inflection points   are good starting points.\u00a0 So, first   graph these points.\u00a0 Now, start to the   left and start graphing the increasing/decreasing information as we did in   the previous section when all we had was the increasing/decreasing information.\u00a0 As we graph this we will make sure that the   concavity information matches up with what we\u2019re graphing....\u00a0...Using all this information to sketch the graph gives the   following graph....\u00a0...We can use the previous example to illustrate another way to classify some of the critical points of a function as relative maximums or relative minimums....\u00a0...Notice that ...\u00a0is a relative maximum and that the function is concave down at this point. This means that ...\u00a0must be negative.\u00a0 Likewise, ...\u00a0is a relative minimum and the function is concave up at this point.\u00a0 This means that ...\u00a0must be positive.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As we\u2019ll see in a bit we will need to be very careful with ....\u00a0 In this case the second derivative is zero, but that will not actually mean that ...\u00a0is not a relative minimum or maximum.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see some examples of this in a bit, but we need to get some other information taken care of first....\u00a0...It is also important to note here that all of the critical points in this example were critical points in which the first derivative was zero and this is required for this to work.\u00a0 We will not be able to use this test on critical points where the derivative doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Here is the test that can be used to classify some of the critical points of a function.\u00a0 The proof of this test is in the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point of ...\u00a0such that ...\u00a0and that ...\u00a0is continuous in a region around ....\u00a0 Then,...\u00a0...The third part of the second derivative test is important to notice.\u00a0 If the second derivative is zero then the critical point can be anything.\u00a0 Below are the graphs of three functions all of which have a critical point at ..., the second derivative of all of the functions is zero at ...\u00a0and yet all three possibilities are exhibited....\u00a0...The first is the graph of ....\u00a0 This graph has a relative minimum at .......\u00a0...Next is the graph of ...\u00a0which has a relative maximum at .......\u00a0...Finally, there is the graph of ...\u00a0and this graph had neither a relative minimum or a relative maximum at .......\u00a0...So, we can see that we have to be careful if we fall into the third case.\u00a0 For those times when we do fall into this case we will have to resort to other methods of classifying the critical point.\u00a0 This is usually done with the first derivative test....\u00a0...Let\u2019s go back and relook at the critical points from the first example and use the Second Derivative Test on them, if possible....\u00a0...Use   the second derivative test to classify the critical points of the function,...Note that all we\u2019re doing here is verifying the results   from the first example.\u00a0 The second   derivative is,...\u00a0...The three critical points ( ...,   ...,   and ...) of this function are all critical   points where the first derivative is zero so we know that we at least have a   chance that the Second Derivative Test will work.\u00a0 The value of the second derivative for each   of these are,...\u00a0...The second derivative at ...\u00a0is negative so by the Second Derivative Test   this critical point this is a relative maximum as we saw in the first   example.\u00a0 The second derivative at\u00a0 ...\u00a0is positive and so we have a relative minimum   here by the Second Derivative Test as we also saw in the first example....\u00a0...In the case of ...the second derivative is zero and so   we can\u2019t use the Second Derivative Test to classify this critical point.\u00a0 Note however, that we do know from the   First Derivative Test we used in the first example that ... the critical point is not a relative extrema....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one more example....\u00a0...For   the following function find the inflection points and use the second   derivative test, if possible, to classify the critical points.\u00a0 Also, determine the intervals of   increase/decrease and the intervals of concave up/concave down and sketch the   graph of the function....We\u2019ll need the first and second derivatives to get us   started....The critical points are,...Notice as well that we won\u2019t be able to use the second   derivative test on ...\u00a0to classify this critical point since the   derivative doesn\u2019t exist at this point.\u00a0   To classify this we\u2019ll need the increasing/decreasing information that   we\u2019ll get to sketch the graph....\u00a0...We can however, use the Second Derivative Test to classify   the other critical point so let\u2019s do that before we proceed with the   sketching work.\u00a0 Here is the value of   the second derivative at .......\u00a0...So, according to the second derivative test ...\u00a0is a relative maximum....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s proceed with the work to get the sketch of the   graph and notice that once we have the increasing/decreasing information   we\u2019ll be able to classify .......\u00a0...Here is the number line for the first derivative....\u00a0...So, according to the first derivative test we can verify   that ...\u00a0is in fact a relative maximum.\u00a0 We can also see that ...\u00a0is a relative minimum.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Be careful not to assume that a critical point that can\u2019t   be used in the second derivative test won\u2019t be a relative extrema.\u00a0 We\u2019ve clearly seen now both with this   example and in the discussion after we have the test that just because we   can\u2019t use the Second Derivative Test or the Test doesn\u2019t tell us anything   about a critical point doesn\u2019t mean that the critical point will not be a   relative extrema.\u00a0 This is a common   mistake that many students make so be careful when using the Second   Derivative Test....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s finish the problem out.\u00a0 We will need the list of possible   inflection points.\u00a0 These are,...Here is the number line for the second derivative.\u00a0 Note that we will need this to see if the   two points above are in fact inflection points....\u00a0...So, the concavity only changes at ...\u00a0and so this is the only inflection point for   this function....\u00a0...Here is the sketch of the graph....\u00a0...The change of concavity at ...\u00a0is hard to see, but it is there it\u2019s just a   very subtle change in concavity.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ShapeofGraphPtII.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes :

(there might be more, but all we need for this particular   argument is two) such that ....\u00a0 But if we do this then we know from Rolle\u2019s   Theorem that there must then be another number ...

contradictory statements by assuming that   ...\u00a0has at least two roots.\u00a0 Since this assumption leads to a   contradiction the assumption must be false and so we can only have a single   real root....\u00a0...The reason for covering Rolle\u2019s Theorem is that it is needed in the proof of the Mean Value Theorem.\u00a0 To see the proof see the ... section of the Extras chapter.\u00a0 Here

result of the Mean Value Theorem gives the result of Rolle\u2019s Theorem....\u00a0...Before we take a look at a couple of examples let\u2019s think about a geometric interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem.\u00a0 First define ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and then we know from the Mean Value theorem that there is a ... such that ...\u00a0and that...\u00a0...Now, if we draw in the secant line connecting

Value Theorem tells us is that these two slopes must be equal or in other words the secant line connecting ... and ... and the tangent line at ...\u00a0must be parallel.\u00a0 We can see this in the following sketch....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a look at a couple of examples using the Mean Value Theorem....\u00a0...Determine   all the numbers ... which satisfy the   conclusions of the Mean Value Theorem for the following function....There isn\u2019t really a whole lot to this problem other than   to notice that since ...\u00a0is a polynomial it is both continuous and   differentiable (... the derivative   exists) on the interval given....\u00a0...First let\u2019s find the derivative....\u00a0...Now, to find the numbers that satisfy the conclusions of   the Mean Value Theorem all we need to do is plug this into the formula given   by the Mean Value Theorem....\u00a0...Now, this is just a quadratic equation,...\u00a0...Using the quadratic formula on this we get,...\u00a0...So, solving gives two values of .......\u00a0...Notice that only one of these is actually in the interval   given in the problem.\u00a0 That means that   we will exclude the second one (since it isn\u2019t in the interval).\u00a0 The number that we\u2019re after in this problem   is,...\u00a0...Be careful to not assume that only one of the numbers will   work.\u00a0 It is possible for both of them   to work....\u00a0...Suppose   that we know that ...\u00a0is continuous and differentiable on [6,   15].\u00a0 Let\u2019s also suppose that we know   that ...\u00a0and that we know that ....\u00a0 What is the largest possible value for ...?...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem....\u00a0...Plugging in for the known quantities and rewriting

value.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This means that the largest possible value for ...\u00a0is 88....\u00a0...Suppose   that we know that ...\u00a0is continuous and differentiable   everywhere.\u00a0 Let\u2019s also suppose that we   know that ...\u00a0has two roots.\u00a0 Show that ...\u00a0must have at least one root....\u00a0...It is important to note here that all we can say is that ...\u00a0will have at

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to look at optimization problems.\u00a0 In optimization problems we are looking for the largest value or the smallest value that a function can take.\u00a0 We saw how to solve one kind of optimization problem in the ... section where we found the largest and smallest value that a function would take on an interval....\u00a0...In this section we are going to look at another type of optimization problem.\u00a0 Here we will be looking for the largest or smallest value of a function subject to some kind of constraint.\u00a0 The constraint will be some condition (that can usually be described by some equation) that must absolutely, positively be true no matter what our solution is.\u00a0 On occasion, the constraint will not be easily described by an equation, but in these problems it will be easy to deal with as we\u2019ll see....\u00a0...This section is generally one of the more difficult for students taking a Calculus course.\u00a0 One of the main reasons for this is that a subtle change of wording can completely change the problem.\u00a0 There is also the problem of identifying the quantity that we\u2019ll be optimizing and the quantity that is the constraint and writing down equations for each....\u00a0...The first step in all of these problems should be to very carefully read the problem.\u00a0 Once you\u2019ve done that the next step is to identify the quantity to be optimized and the constraint.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In identifying the constraint remember that the constraint is the quantity that must true regardless of the solution.\u00a0 In almost every one of the problems we\u2019ll be looking at here one quantity will be clearly indicated as having a fixed value and so must be the constraint.\u00a0 Once you\u2019ve got that identified the quantity to be optimized should be fairly simple to get.\u00a0 It is however easy to confuse the two if you just skim the problem so make sure you carefully read the problem first!...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start the section off with a simple problem to illustrate the kinds of issues we will be dealing with here....\u00a0...We   need to enclose a field with a fence.\u00a0   We have 500 feet of fencing material and a building is on one side of   the field and so won\u2019t need any fencing.\u00a0   Determine the dimensions of the field that will enclose the largest   area....\u00a0...In all of these problems we will have two functions.\u00a0 The first is the function that we are   actually trying to optimize and the second will be the constraint.\u00a0\u00a0 Sketching the situation will often help us   to arrive at these equations so let\u2019s do that....In this problem we want to maximize the area of a field   and we know that will use 500 ft of fencing material.\u00a0 So, the area will be the function we are   trying to optimize and the amount of fencing is the constraint. The two   equations for these are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Okay, we know how to find the largest or smallest value of   a function provided it\u2019s only got a single variable.\u00a0 The area function (as well as the   constraint) has two variables in it and so what we know about finding   absolute extrema won\u2019t work.\u00a0 However,   if we solve the constraint for one of the two variables we can substitute   this into the area and we will then have a function of a single variable....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s solve the constraint for ....\u00a0 Note that we could have   just as easily solved for ... but   that would have led to fractions and so, in this case, solving for ... will probably be best....\u00a0...Substituting this into the area function gives a function   of .......\u00a0...Now we want to find the largest value this will have on   the interval [0,250].\u00a0 Note that the   interval corresponds to taking ...\u00a0(...   no sides to the fence) and ...\u00a0(...   only two sides and no width, also if there are two sides each must be 250 ft   to use the whole 500ft).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that the endpoints of the interval won\u2019t make any   sense from a physical standpoint if we actually want to enclose some area   because they would both give zero area.\u00a0   They do, however, give us a set of limits on ... and so the ...   tells us that we will have a maximum value of the area somewhere between the   two endpoints.\u00a0 Having these limits   will also mean that we can use the process we discussed in the\u00a0 ... section earlier in the chapter to find the maximum value of the   area....\u00a0...So, recall that the maximum value of a continuous function   (which we\u2019ve got here) on a closed interval (which we also have here) will   occur at critical points and/or end points.\u00a0   As we\u2019ve already pointed out the end points in this case will give   zero area and so don\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0   That means our only option will be the critical points....\u00a0...So let\u2019s get the derivative and find the critical points....\u00a0...Setting this equal to zero and solving gives a lone   critical point of ....\u00a0 Plugging this into the area gives an area   of 31250 ft....\u00a0 So according   to the method from Absolute Extrema section this must be the largest possible   area, since the area at either endpoint is zero....\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s not forget to get the value of ... and then we\u2019ll have the dimensions   since this is what the problem statement asked for.\u00a0 We can get the ... by plugging in our ...   into the constraint....\u00a0...The dimensions of the field that will give the largest   area, subject to the fact that we used exactly 500 ft of fencing material,   are 250 x 125....\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget to actually read the problem and give the   answer that was asked for.\u00a0 These types   of problems can take a fair amount of time/effort to solve and it\u2019s not hard   to sometimes forget what the problem was actually asking for....\u00a0...In the previous problem we used the method from the Finding Absolute Extrema section to find the maximum value of the function we wanted to optimize.\u00a0 However, as we\u2019ll see in later examples it will not always be easy to find endpoints.  Also, even if we can find the endpoints we will see that sometimes dealing with the endpoints may not be easy either.\u00a0 Not only that, but this method requires that the function we\u2019re optimizing be continuous on the interval we\u2019re looking at, including the endpoints, and that may not always be the case....\u00a0...So, before proceeding with any more examples let\u2019s spend a little time discussing some methods for determining if our solution is in fact the absolute minimum/maximum value that we\u2019re looking for.\u00a0 In some examples all of these will work while in others one or more won\u2019t be all that useful.\u00a0 However, we will always need to use some method for making sure that our answer is in fact that optimal value that we\u2019re after....\u00a0... ... Use the method used in .......\u00a0...This is the method used in the first example above.\u00a0 Recall that in order to use this method the range of possible optimal values, let\u2019s call it ..., must have finite endpoints.\u00a0 Also, the function we\u2019re optimizing (once it\u2019s down to a single variable) must be continuous on ..., including the endpoints.\u00a0 If these conditions are met then we know that the optimal value, either the maximum or minimum depending on the problem, will occur at either the endpoints of the range or at a critical point that is inside the range of possible solutions....\u00a0...There are two main issues that will often prevent this method from being used however.\u00a0 First, not every problem will actually have a range of possible solutions that have finite endpoints at both ends.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see at least one example of this as we work through the remaining examples.\u00a0 Also, many of the functions we\u2019ll be optimizing will not be continuous once we reduce them down to a single variable and this will prevent us from using this method....\u00a0... Use a variant of the\u00a0 .......\u00a0...In this method we also will need a range of possible optimal values, ....\u00a0 However, in this case, unlike the previous method the endpoints do not need to be finite.\u00a0 Also, we will need to require that the function be continuous on the interior ... and we will only need the function to be continuous at the end points if the endpoint is finite and the function actually exists at the endpoint.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see several problems where the function we\u2019re optimizing doesn\u2019t actually exist at one of the endpoints.\u00a0 This will not prevent this method from being used....\u00a0...Let\u2019s suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point of the function we\u2019re trying to optimize, ....\u00a0 We already know from the First Derivative Test that if ...\u00a0immediately to the left of ...\u00a0(... the function is increasing immediately to the left) and if ...\u00a0immediately to the right of ...(... the function is decreasing immediately to the right) then ...\u00a0will be a relative maximum for ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, this does not mean that the absolute maximum of ...\u00a0will occur at ....\u00a0 However, suppose that we knew a little bit more information.\u00a0 Suppose that in fact we knew that ...\u00a0for all ... in ... such that ....\u00a0 Likewise, suppose that we knew that ...\u00a0for all ... in ... such that ....\u00a0 In this case we know that to the left of ..., provided we stay in ... of course, the function is always increasing and to the right of ..., again staying in ..., we are always decreasing.\u00a0 In this case we can say that the absolute maximum of ...\u00a0in ... will occur at ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Similarly, if we know that to the left of ...\u00a0the function is always decreasing and to the right of ...\u00a0the function is always increasing then the absolute minimum of ...\u00a0in ... will occur at ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before we give a summary of this method let\u2019s discuss the continuity requirement a little.\u00a0 Nowhere in the above discussion did the continuity requirement apparently come into play.\u00a0 We require that the function we\u2019re optimizing to be continuous in ... to prevent the following situation....\u00a0...In this case, a relative maximum of the function clearly occurs at ....\u00a0 Also, the function is always decreasing to the right and is always increasing to the left.\u00a0 However, because of the discontinuity at ..., we can clearly see that ...\u00a0and so the absolute maximum of the function does not occur at ....\u00a0 Had the discontinuity at ...\u00a0not been there this would not have happened and the absolute maximum would have occurred at .......\u00a0...Here is a summary of this method....\u00a0...Let ... be the   interval of all possible optimal values of ...\u00a0and further suppose that ...\u00a0is continuous on ... , except possibly at the endpoints.\u00a0 Finally suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point of ...\u00a0and that ...   is in the interval ....\u00a0 If we restrict ... to values from ... (... we only consider possible optimal   values of the function) then, ...   ...   ...\u00a0... Use the second derivative....\u00a0...There are actually two ways to use the second derivative to help us identify the optimal value of a function and both use the ... to one extent or another....\u00a0...The first way to use the second derivative doesn\u2019t actually help us to identify the optimal value.\u00a0 What it does do is allow us to potentially exclude values and knowing this can simplify our work somewhat and so is not a bad thing to do.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Suppose that we are looking for the absolute maximum of a function and after finding the critical points we find that we have multiple critical points.\u00a0 Let\u2019s also suppose that we run all of them through the second derivative test and determine that some of them are in fact relative minimums of the function.\u00a0 Since we are after the absolute maximum we know that a maximum (of any kind) can\u2019t occur at relative minimums and so we immediately know that we can exclude these points from further consideration.\u00a0 We could do a similar check if we were looking for the absolute minimum.\u00a0 Doing this may not seem like all that great of a thing to do, but it can, on occasion, lead to a nice reduction in the amount of work that we need to do in later steps....\u00a0...The second way of using the second derivative to identify the optimal value of a function is in fact very similar to the second method above.\u00a0 In fact we will have the same requirements for this method as we did in that method.\u00a0 We need an interval of possible optimal values, ... and the endpoint(s) may or may not be finite.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also need to require that the function, ...\u00a0be continuous everywhere in ... except possibly at the endpoints as above....\u00a0...Now, suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point and that ....\u00a0 The second derivative test tells us that ...\u00a0must be a relative minimum of the function.\u00a0 Suppose however that we also knew that ...\u00a0for all ... in ....\u00a0 In this case we would know that the function was concave up in all of ... and that would in turn mean that the absolute minimum of ...\u00a0in ... would in fact have to be at .......\u00a0...Likewise if ...\u00a0is a critical point and\u00a0 ...\u00a0for all ... in ... then we would know that the function was concave down in ... and that the absolute maximum of\u00a0 ...\u00a0in ... would have to be at .......\u00a0...Here is a summary of this method....\u00a0...Let ... be the   range of all possible optimal values of ...\u00a0and further suppose that ...\u00a0is continuous on ... , except possibly at the endpoints.\u00a0 Finally suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point of ...\u00a0and that ...   is in the interval ....\u00a0 Then, ...   ...   ...\u00a0...Before proceeding with some more examples we need to once again acknowledge that not every method discussed above will work for every problem and that, in some problems, more than one method will work.\u00a0 There are also problems where we may need to use a combination of these methods to identify the optimal value.\u00a0 Each problem will be different and we\u2019ll need to see what we\u2019ve got once we get the critical points before we decide which method might be best to use....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...We   want to construct a box whose base length is 3 times the base width.\u00a0 The material used to build the top and   bottom cost $10/ft... and the material used to build the sides cost   $6/ft....\u00a0 If the box must   have a volume of 50ft... determine the dimensions that will minimize   the cost to build the box....\u00a0...First, a quick figure (probably not to scale\u2026)....\u00a0...We want to minimize the cost of the materials subject to   the constraint that the volume must be 50ft....\u00a0 Note as well that the cost for each side is   just the area of that side times the appropriate cost.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The two functions we\u2019ll be working with here this time   are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...As with the first example, we will solve the constraint   for one of the variables and plug this into the cost.\u00a0 It will definitely be easier to solve the   constraint for ... so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Plugging this into the cost gives,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s get the first and second (we\u2019ll be needing this   later\u2026) derivatives,...\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got two critical points here.\u00a0 The first is obvious, ...,   and it\u2019s also just as obvious that this will not be the correct value.\u00a0 We are building a box here and ... is the box\u2019s width and so since it   makes no sense to talk about a box with zero width we will ignore this   critical point.\u00a0 This does not mean   however that you should just get into the habit of ignoring zero when it   occurs.\u00a0 There are other types of   problems where it will be a valid point that we will need to consider....\u00a0...The next critical point will come from determining where   the numerator is zero....\u00a0...So, once we throw out ...,   we\u2019ve got a single critical point and we now have to verify that this is in   fact the value that will give the absolute minimum cost.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case we can\u2019t use Method 1 from above.\u00a0 First, the function is not continuous at   one of the endpoints, ...,   of our interval of possible values.\u00a0   Secondly, there is no theoretical upper limit to the width that will   give a box with volume of 50 ft....\u00a0   If ... is very large then we   would just need to make ... very   small....\u00a0...The second method listed above would work here, but that\u2019s   going to involve some calculations, not difficult calculations, but more work   nonetheless....\u00a0...The third method however, will work quickly and simply   here.\u00a0 First, we know that whatever the   value of ... that we get it will have   to be positive and we can see second derivative above that provided ...\u00a0we will have ...\u00a0and so in the interval of possible optimal   values the cost function will always be concave up and so ...\u00a0must give the absolute minimum cost....\u00a0...All we need to do now is to find the remaining dimensions....\u00a0...\u00a0...Also, even though it was not asked for, the minimum cost   is : .......\u00a0...We   want to construct a box with a square base and we only have 10 m...   of material to use in construction of the box.\u00a0 Assuming that all the material is used in   the construction process determine the maximum volume that the box can have....\u00a0...This example is in many ways the exact opposite of the   previous example.\u00a0 In this case we want   to optimize the volume and the constraint this time is the amount of material   used.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have a cost here, but   if you think about it the cost is nothing more than the amount of material   used times a cost and so the amount of material and cost are pretty much tied   together.\u00a0 If you can do one you can do   the other as well.\u00a0 Note as well that   the amount of material used is really just the surface area of the box....\u00a0...As always, let\u2019s start off with a quick sketch of the box....\u00a0...Now, as mentioned above we want to maximize the volume and   the amount of material is the constraint so here are the equations we\u2019ll   need....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll solve the   constraint for ... and plug this into   the equation for the volume....\u00a0...Here are the   first and second derivatives of the volume function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note as well   here that provided ...,   which we know from a physical standpoint will be true, then the volume   function will be concave down and so if we get a single critical point then   we know that it will have to be the value that gives the absolute maximum....\u00a0...Setting the   first derivative equal to zero and solving gives us the two critical points,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case we   can exclude the negative critical point since we are dealing with a length of   a box and we know that these must be positive.\u00a0 Do not however get into the habit of just   excluding any negative critical point.\u00a0   There are problems where negative critical points are perfectly valid   possible solutions....\u00a0...Now, as noted   above we got a single critical point, 1.2910, and so this must be the value   that gives the maximum volume and since the maximum volume is all that was   asked for in the problem statement the answer is then : .......\u00a0...Note that we   could also have noted here that if ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0and likewise if ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0and so if we are to the left of the critical   point the volume is always increasing and if we are to the right of the   critical point the volume is always decreasing and so by the Method 2 above   we can also see that the single critical point must give the absolute maximum   of the volume....\u00a0...Finally, even   though these weren\u2019t asked for here are the dimension of the box that gives   the maximum volume....\u00a0...So, it looks like in this case we actually have a perfect   cube....\u00a0...In the last two examples we\u2019ve seen that many of these optimization problems can be done in both directions so to speak.\u00a0 In both examples we have essentially the same two equations: volume and surface area.\u00a0 However, in Example 2 the volume was the constraint and the cost (which is directly related to the surface area) was the function we were trying to optimize.\u00a0 In Example 3, on the other hand, we were trying to optimize the volume and the surface area was the constraint....\u00a0...It is important to not get so locked into one way of doing these problems that we can\u2019t do it in the opposite direction as needed as well.\u00a0 This is one of the more common mistakes that students make with these kinds of problems.\u00a0 They see one problem and then try to make every other problem that seems to be the same conform to that one solution even if the problem needs to be worked differently.\u00a0 Keep an open mind with these problems and make sure that you understand what is being optimized and what the constraint is before you jump into the solution....\u00a0...Also, as seen in the last example we used two different methods of verifying that we did get the optimal value.\u00a0 Do not get too locked into one method of doing this verification that you forget about the other methods....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some another example that this time doesn\u2019t involve a rectangle or box....\u00a0...A   manufacturer needs to make a cylindrical can that will hold 1.5 liters of   liquid.\u00a0 Determine the dimensions of   the can that will minimize the amount of material used in its construction....\u00a0...In this problem the constraint is the volume and we want   to minimize the amount of material used.\u00a0   This means that what we want to minimize is the surface area of the   can and we\u2019ll need to include both the walls of the can as well as the top   and bottom \u201ccaps\u201d.\u00a0 Here is a quick   sketch to get us started off....\u00a0...We\u2019ll need the surface area of this can and that will be   the surface area of the walls of the can (which is really just a cylinder)   and the area of the top and bottom caps (which are just disks, and don\u2019t   forget that there are two of them).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that if you think of a cylinder of height ... and radius ... as just a bunch of disks/circles of radius ... stacked on top of each other the equations for the surface area   and volume are pretty simple to remember.\u00a0   The volume is just the area of each of the disks times the   height.\u00a0 Similarly, the surface area is   just the circumference of the each circle times the height.\u00a0 The equations for the volume and surface   area of a cylinder are then,...\u00a0...Next, we\u2019re also going to need the required volume in a better   set of units than liters.\u00a0 Since we   want length measurements for the radius and height we\u2019ll need to use the fact   that 1 Liter = 1000 cm... to convert the 1.5 liters into 1500 cm....\u00a0 This will in turn give a radius and height   in terms of centimeters. ...\u00a0...Here are the equations that we\u2019ll need for this problem   and don\u2019t forget that there two caps and so we\u2019ll need the area from each....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case it   looks like our best option is to solve the constraint for ... and plug this into the area   function....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Notice that   this formula will only make sense from a physical standpoint if ...\u00a0which is a good thing as it is not defined   at .......\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s get   the first derivative....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...From this we   can see that we have two critical points : ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The first critical point doesn\u2019t make sense   from a physical standpoint and so we can ignore that one.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So we only have   a single critical point to deal with here and notice that 6.2035 is the only   value for which the derivative will be zero and hence the only place (with ...\u00a0of course) that the derivative may change   sign.\u00a0 It\u2019s not difficult to check that   if ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0and likewise if ...\u00a0then ....\u00a0 The variant of the First Derivative Test   above then tells us that the absolute minimum value of the area (for ...)\u00a0   must occur at .......\u00a0...All we need to   do this is determine height of the can and we\u2019ll be done....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Therefore if   the manufacturer makes the can with a radius of 6.2035 cm and a height of   12.4070 cm the least amount of material will be used to make the can....\u00a0...As an interesting side problem and extension to the above example you might want to show that for a given volume, ..., the minimum material will be used if ...\u00a0regardless of the volume of the can....\u00a0...In the examples to this point we\u2019ve put in quite a bit of discussion in the solution.\u00a0 In the remaining problems we won\u2019t be putting in quite as much discussion and leave it to you to fill in any missing details....\u00a0...We   have a piece of cardboard that is 14 inches by 10 inches and we\u2019re going to   cut out the corners as shown below and fold up the sides to form a box, also   shown below.\u00a0 Determine the height of   the box that will give a maximum volume....In this example, for the first time, we\u2019ve run into a   problem where the constraint doesn\u2019t really have an equation.\u00a0 The constraint is simply the size of the   piece of cardboard and has already been factored into the figure above.\u00a0 This will happen on occasion and so don\u2019t   get excited about it when it does.\u00a0   This just means that we have one less equation to worry about. In this   case we want to maximize the volume. Here is the volume, in terms of ... and its first derivative....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Setting the   first derivative equal to zero and solving gives the following two critical   points,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We now have an   apparent problem.\u00a0 We have two critical   points and we\u2019ll need to determine which one is the value we need.\u00a0 In this case, this is easier than it   looks.\u00a0 Go back to the figure in the   problem statement and notice that we can quite easily find limits on ....\u00a0   The smallest ... can be is ...\u00a0even though this doesn\u2019t make much sense as   we won\u2019t get a box in this case.\u00a0 Also   from the 10 inch side we can see that the largest ... can be is ...\u00a0although again, this doesn\u2019t make much sense   physically....\u00a0...So, knowing   that whatever ... is it must be in   the range ...\u00a0we can see that the second critical point is   outside this range and so the only critical point that we need to worry about   is 1.9183....\u00a0...Finally, since   the volume is defined and continuous on ...\u00a0all we need to do is plug in the critical   points and endpoints into the volume to determine which gives the largest   volume.\u00a0 Here are those function   evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, if we take ...\u00a0we get a maximum volume....\u00a0...A   printer need to make a poster that will have a total area of 200 in...   and will have 1 inch margins on the sides, a 2 inch margin on the top and a   1.5 inch margin on the bottom.\u00a0 What   dimensions will give the largest printed area? ...\u00a0...This problem is a little different from the previous   problems.\u00a0 Both the constraint and the   function we are going to optimize are areas.\u00a0   The constraint is that the overall area of the poster must be 200 in...   while we want to optimize the printed area (... the area of the poster with the margins taken out)....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the poster and we can see that once   we\u2019ve taken the margins into account the width of the printed area is ...\u00a0and the height of the printer area is .......\u00a0...Here are the equations that we\u2019ll be working with....\u00a0...Solving the constraint for ... and plugging into the equation for the printed area gives,...The first and second derivatives are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...From the first derivative   we have the following three critical points....However, since   we\u2019re dealing with the dimensions of a piece of paper we know that we must   have ...\u00a0and so only 10.6904 will make sense.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also notice   that provided ...\u00a0the second derivative will always be   negative and so in the range of possible optimal values of the width the area   function is always concave down and so we know that the maximum printed area   will be at .......\u00a0...The height of the paper that gives the maximum printed   area is then,...\u00a0...We\u2019ve worked quite a few examples to this point and we have quite a few more to work.\u00a0 However this section has gotten quite lengthy so let\u2019s continue our examples in the next section.\u00a0 This is being done mostly because these notes are also being presented on the web and this will help to keep the load times on the pages down somewhat.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Optimization.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Optimization", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Because these notes are also being presented on the web we\u2019ve broken the optimization examples up into several sections to keep the load times to a minimum.\u00a0 Do not forget the various ... for verifying that we have the optimal value that we looked at in the previous section.\u00a0 In this section we\u2019ll just use them without acknowledging so make sure you understand them and can use them.\u00a0 So let\u2019s get going on some more examples....\u00a0...A   window is being built and the bottom is a rectangle and the top is a   semicircle.\u00a0 If there is 12 meters of   framing materials what must the dimensions of the window be to let in the   most light?...\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s ask this question again in slightly easier to   understand terms.\u00a0 We want a window in   the shape described above to have a maximum area (and hence let in the most   light) and have a perimeter of 12 m (because we have 12 m of framing   material).\u00a0 Little bit easier to   understand in those terms. ...\u00a0...Here\u2019s a sketch of the window.\u00a0 The height of the rectangular portion is ... and because the semicircle is on top   we can think of the width of the rectangular portion at 2.......\u00a0...The perimeter (our constraint) is the lengths of the three   sides on the rectangular portion plus half the circumference of a circle of   radius ....\u00a0 The area (what we want to maximize) is the   area of the rectangle plus half the area of a circle of radius ....\u00a0   Here are the equations we\u2019ll be working with in this example....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case   we\u2019ll solve the constraint for ...   and plug that into the area equation....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first and   second derivatives are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We can see that   the only critical point is,...\u00a0...We can also see   that the second derivative is always negative (in fact it\u2019s a constant) and   so we can see that the maximum area must occur at this point.\u00a0 So, for the maximum area the semicircle on   top must have a radius of 1.6803 and the rectangle must have the dimensions   3.3606 x 1.6803 (... x 2...)....\u00a0...Determine   the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a circle of radius   4....Huh?\u00a0 This problem   is best described with a sketch.\u00a0 Here   is what we\u2019re looking for....We want the area of the largest rectangle that we can fit   inside a circle and have all of its corners touching the circle....\u00a0...To do this problem it\u2019s easiest to assume that the circle   (and hence the rectangle) is centered at the origin.\u00a0 Doing this we know that the equation of the   circle will be...and that the right upper corner of the rectangle will have   the coordinates ....\u00a0 This means that the width of the rectangle   will be 2... and the height of the   rectangle will be 2....\u00a0 The area of the rectangle will then be,...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got the function we want to maximize (the area),   but what is the constraint?\u00a0 Well since   the coordinates of the upper right corner must be on the circle we know that ... and ... must satisfy the equation of the circle.\u00a0 In other words, the equation of the circle   is the constraint....\u00a0...The first thing to do then is to solve the constraint for   one of the variables....\u00a0...Since the point that we\u2019re looking at is in the first   quadrant we know that ... must be   positive and so we can take the \u201c+\u201d part of this.\u00a0 Plugging this into the area and computing   the first derivative gives,...\u00a0...Before getting the critical points let\u2019s notice that we   can limit ... to the range ...\u00a0since we are assuming that ... is in the first quadrant and must   stay inside the circle.\u00a0 Now the four   critical points we get (two from the numerator and two from the denominator)   are,...\u00a0...We only want critical points that are in the range of   possible optimal values so that means that we have two critical points to   deal with : ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Notice however that the second critical   point is also one of the endpoints of our interval....\u00a0...Now, area function is continuous and we have an interval   of possible solution with finite endpoints so,...\u00a0...So, we can see that we\u2019ll get the maximum area if ...\u00a0and the corresponding value of ... is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It looks like   the maximum area will be found if the inscribed rectangle is in fact a   square....\u00a0...We need to again make a point that was made several times in the previous section.\u00a0 We excluded several critical points in the work above.\u00a0 Do not always expect to do that.\u00a0 There will often be physical reasons to exclude zero and/or negative critical points, however, there will be problems where these are perfectly acceptable values.\u00a0 You should always write down every possible critical point and then exclude any that can\u2019t be possible solutions.\u00a0 This keeps you in the habit of finding all the critical points and then deciding which ones you actually need and that in turn will make it less likely that you\u2019ll miss one when it is actually needed....\u00a0...Determine   the point(s) on ...\u00a0that are closest to (0,2)....\u00a0...Here\u2019s a quick sketch of the situation....\u00a0...So, we\u2019re looking for the shortest length of the dashed   line.\u00a0 Notice as well that if the   shortest distance isn\u2019t at ...\u00a0there will be two points on the graph, as   we\u2019ve shown above, that will give the shortest distance.\u00a0 This is because the parabola is symmetric   to the ...-axis and the point in   question is on the ...-axis.\u00a0 This won\u2019t always be the case of course so   don\u2019t always expect two points in these kinds of problems....\u00a0...In this case we need to minimize the distance between the   point (0,2) and any point that is one the graph (...).\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...If you think about the situation here it makes sense that   the point that minimizes the distance will also minimize the square of the   distance and so since it will be easier to work with we will use the square   of the distance and minimize that.\u00a0 If   you aren\u2019t convinced of this we\u2019ll take a closer look at this after this   problem.\u00a0 So, the function that we\u2019re   going to minimize is,...\u00a0...The constraint in this case is the function itself since   the point must lie on the graph of the function....\u00a0...At this point there are two methods for proceeding.\u00a0 One of which will require significantly   more work than the other.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a   look at both of them....\u00a0...In this case we will use the constraint in probably the   most obvious way.\u00a0 We already have the   constraint solved for ... so let\u2019s   plug that into the square of the distance and get the derivatives....\u00a0...So, it looks like there are three critical points for the   square of the distance and notice that this time, unlike pretty much every   previous example we\u2019ve worked, we can\u2019t exclude zero or negative   numbers.\u00a0 They are perfectly valid   possible optimal values this time....\u00a0...Before going any farther, let\u2019s check these in the second   derivative to see if they are all relative minimums....\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is a relative maximum and so can\u2019t possibly   be the minimum distance.\u00a0 That means   that we\u2019ve got two critical points. The question is how do we verify that   these give the minimum distance and yes we did mean to say that both will   give the minimum distance.\u00a0 Recall from   our sketch above that if ... gives   the minimum distance then so will ... and so if gives the minimum distance   then the other should as well....\u00a0...None of the methods we discussed in the previous section   will really work here.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have   an interval of possible solutions with finite endpoints and both the first   and second derivative change sign.\u00a0 In   this case however, we can still verify that they are the points that give the   minimum distance. ...\u00a0...First, notice that if we are working on the interval ...\u00a0then the endpoints of this interval (which   are also the critical points) are in fact where the absolute minimum of the   function occurs in this interval.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next we can see that if ...\u00a0then ....\u00a0 Or in other words, if ...\u00a0the function is decreasing until it hits ...\u00a0and so must always be larger than the   function at .......\u00a0...Similarly,\u00a0 ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0and so the function is always increasing to   the right of\u00a0 ...\u00a0and so must be larger than the function at .......\u00a0...So, putting all of this together tells us that we do in   fact have an absolute minimum at .......\u00a0...All that we need to do is to find the value of ... for these points....\u00a0...So, the points on the graph that are closest to (0,2) are,...\u00a0...The first solution that we worked was actually the long   solution.\u00a0 There is a much shorter   solution to this problem.\u00a0 Instead of   plugging ... into the square of the   distance let\u2019s plug in ....\u00a0 From the constraint we get,...and notice that the only place ... show up in the square of the distance it shows up as ... and let\u2019s just plug this   into the square of the distance.\u00a0 Doing   this gives,...\u00a0...There is now a single critical point, ...,   and since the second derivative is always positive we know that this point   must give the absolute minimum.\u00a0 So all   that we need to do at this point is find the value(s) of ... that go with this value of .......\u00a0...The points are then,...\u00a0...So, for significantly less work we got exactly the same   answer....\u00a0...This previous example had a couple of nice points.\u00a0 First, as pointed out in the problem, we couldn\u2019t exclude zero or negative critical points this time as we\u2019ve done in all the previous examples.\u00a0 Again, be careful to not get into the habit of always excluding them as we do many of the examples we\u2019ll work....\u00a0...Next, some of these problems will have multiple solution methods and sometimes one will be significantly easier than the other.\u00a0 The method you use is up to you and often the difficulty of any particular method is dependent upon the person doing the problem.\u00a0 One person may find one way easier and other person may find a different method easier....\u00a0...Finally, as we saw in the first solution method sometimes we\u2019ll need to use a combination of the optimal value verification methods we discussed in the previous section....\u00a0...Now, before we move onto the next example let\u2019s take a look at the claim above that we could find the location of the point that minimizes the distance by finding the point that minimizes the square of the distance.\u00a0 We\u2019ll generalize things a little bit,...\u00a0...Suppose that we have a positive function, ...,   that exists everywhere then ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will have the same critical points and the   relative extrema will occur at the same points....\u00a0...This is simple enough to prove so let\u2019s do that here.\u00a0 First let\u2019s take the derivative of ...\u00a0and see what we can determine about the critical points of .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s plug ...\u00a0into this to get,...\u00a0...By assumption we know that ...\u00a0exists and ...\u00a0and therefore the denominator of this will always exist and will never be zero.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need this in several places so we can\u2019t forget this....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0then because we know that the denominator will not be zero here we must also have ....\u00a0 Likewise, if ...\u00a0then we must have .... So,\u00a0 ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will have the same critical points in which the derivatives will be zero....\u00a0...Next, if ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist then ...\u00a0will also not exist and likewise if ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist then because we know that the denominator will not be zero then this means that ...\u00a0will also not exist.\u00a0 Therefore, ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will have the same critical points in which the derivatives does not exist....\u00a0...So, the upshot of all this is that\u00a0 ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will have the same critical points....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s notice that because we know that ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will have the same sign and so if we apply the first derivative test (and recalling that they have the same critical points) to each of these functions we can see that the results will be the same and so the relative extrema will occur at the same points....\u00a0...Note that we could also use the second derivative test to verify that the critical points will have the same classification if we wanted to.\u00a0 The second derivative is (and you should see if you can use the quotient rule to verify this),...\u00a0...Then if ...\u00a0is a critical point such that ...\u00a0(and so we can use the second derivative test) we get,...\u00a0...Now, because we know that ...\u00a0and by assumption ...\u00a0we can see that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will have the same sign and so will have the same conclusion from the second derivative test....\u00a0...So, now that we have that out of the way let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...A   2 feet piece of wire is cut into two pieces and once piece is bent into a   square and the other is bent into an equilateral triangle.\u00a0 Where should the wire cut so that the total   area enclosed by both is minimum and maximum?...\u00a0...Before starting the solution recall that an equilateral   triangle is a triangle with three equal sides and each of the interior angles   are ...\u00a0(or ...)....\u00a0...Now, this is another problem where the constraint isn\u2019t   really going to be given by an equation, it is simply that there is 2 ft of   wire to work with and this will be taken into account in our work.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s cut the wire into two pieces.\u00a0 The first piece will have length ... which we\u2019ll bend into a square and   each side will have length ....\u00a0 The second piece will then have length ...\u00a0(we just used the constraint here\u2026) and   we\u2019ll bend this into an equilateral triangle and each side will have length ....\u00a0 Here is a sketch of all this....\u00a0...As noted in the sketch above we also will need the height   of the triangle.\u00a0 This is easy to get   if you realize that the dashed line divides the equilateral triangle into two   other triangles.\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at the   right one.\u00a0 The hypotenuse\u00a0 is ...\u00a0while the lower right angle is ....\u00a0 Finally the height is then the opposite   side to the lower right angle so using basic right triangle trig we arrive at   the height of the triangle as follows....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the total area of both objects is then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here\u2019s the   first derivative of the area....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Setting this   equal to zero and solving gives the single critical point of,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s   notice that the problem statement asked for both the minimum and maximum   enclosed area and we got a single critical point.\u00a0 This clearly can\u2019t be the answer to both,   but this is not the problem that it might seem to be....\u00a0...Let\u2019s notice   that ... must be in the range ...\u00a0and since the area function is continuous we   use the basic process for finding absolute extrema of a function....\u00a0...So, it looks   like the minimum area will arise if we take ...\u00a0while the maximum area will arise if we take   the whole piece of wire and bend it into a square....\u00a0...As the previous problem illustrated we can\u2019t get too locked into the answers always occurring at the critical points as they have to this point.\u00a0 That will often happen, but one of the extrema in the previous problem was at an endpoint and that will happen on occasion....\u00a0...A   piece of pipe is being carried down a hallway that is 10 feet wide.\u00a0 At the end of the hallway the there is a   right-angled turn and the hallway narrows down to 8 feet wide. \u00a0What is the longest pipe that can be carried   (always keeping it horizontal) around the turn in the hallway?...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with a sketch of the situation so we can   get a grip on what\u2019s going on and how we\u2019re going to have to go about solving   this....The largest pipe that can go around the turn will do so in   the position shown above.\u00a0 One end will   be touching the outer wall of the hall way at ... and ... and the pipe   will touch the inner corner at ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s assume that the length of the pipe in   the small hallway is ...\u00a0while ...\u00a0is the length of the pipe in the large   hallway.\u00a0 The pipe then has a length of   .......\u00a0...Now, if ...\u00a0then the pipe is completely in the wider   hallway and we can see that as ...\u00a0then ....\u00a0 Likewise, if ...\u00a0the pipe is completely in the narrow hallway   and as ...\u00a0we also have ....\u00a0 So, somewhere in the interval ...\u00a0is an angle that will minimize ... and oddly enough that is the length   that we\u2019re after.\u00a0 The largest pipe   that will fit around the turn will in fact be the minimum value of .......\u00a0...The constraint for this problem is not so obvious and   there are actually two of them.\u00a0 The   constraints for this problem are the widths of the hallways.\u00a0 We\u2019ll use these to get an equation for ... in terms of ...\u00a0and then we\u2019ll minimize this new equation....\u00a0...So, using basic right triangle trig we can see that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, differentiating   ... gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Setting this   equal to zero and solving gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Solving for ...\u00a0gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, if ...\u00a0radians then the pipe will have a minimum   length and will just fit around the turn.\u00a0   Anything larger will not fit around the turn and so the largest pipe   that can be carried around the turn is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Two   poles, one 6 meters tall and one 15 meters tall, are 20 meters apart.\u00a0 A length of wire is attached to the top of   each pole and it is also staked to the ground somewhere between the two   poles.\u00a0 Where should the wire be staked   so that the minimum amount of wire is used?...\u00a0...As always let\u2019s start off with a sketch of this situation....\u00a0...The total length of the wire is ...\u00a0and we need to determine the value of ... that will minimize this.\u00a0 The constraint in this problem is that the   poles must be 20 meters apart and that ...   must be in the range ....\u00a0 The first thing that we\u2019ll need to do here   is to get the length of wire in terms of ...,   which is fairly simple to do using the Pythagorean Theorem....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Not the nicest function   we\u2019ve had to work with but there it is.\u00a0   Note however, that it is a continuous function and we\u2019ve got an   interval with finite endpoints and so finding the absolute minimum won\u2019t   require much more work than just getting the critical points of this function.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the derivative....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Setting this   equal to zero gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It\u2019s probably   been quite a while since you\u2019ve been asked to solve something like this.\u00a0 To solve this we\u2019ll need to square both   sides to get rid of the roots, but this will cause problems as well soon   see.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first just square both   sides and solve that equation....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that if   you can\u2019t do that factoring don't worry, you can always just use the quadratic   formula and you\u2019ll get the same answers.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Okay two issues   that we need to discuss briefly here.\u00a0   The first solution above (note that I didn\u2019t call it a critical   point\u2026) doesn\u2019t make any sense because it is negative and outside of the   range of possible solutions and so we can ignore it.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Secondly, and   maybe more importantly, if you were to plug ...\u00a0into the derivative you would not get zero   and so is not even a critical point.\u00a0   How is this possible?\u00a0 It is a solution   after all.\u00a0 We\u2019ll recall that we   squared both sides of the equation above and it was mentioned at the time   that this would cause problems.\u00a0 We\u2019ll   we\u2019ve hit those problems.\u00a0 In squaring   both sides we\u2019ve inadvertently introduced a new solution to the   equation.\u00a0 When you do something like   this you should ALWAYS go back and verify that the solutions that you get are in   fact solutions to the original equation.\u00a0   In this case we were lucky and the \u201cbad\u201d solution also happened to be   outside the interval of solutions we were interested in but that won\u2019t always   be the case....\u00a0...So, if we go   back and do a quick verification we can in fact see that the only critical   point is ...\u00a0and this is nicely in our range of   acceptable solutions....\u00a0...Now all that we   need to do is plug this critical point and the endpoints of the wire into the   length formula and identify the one that gives the minimum value....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we will get   the minimum length of wire if we stake it to the ground ...feet from the smaller pole....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a modification of the above problem that asks a completely different question....\u00a0...Two   poles, one 6 meters tall and one 15 meters tall, are 20 meters apart.\u00a0 A length of wire is attached to the top of   each pole and it is also staked to the ground somewhere between the two   poles.\u00a0 Where should the wire be staked   so that the angle formed by the two pieces of wire at the stake is a maximum?...\u00a0...Here\u2019s a sketch for this example....\u00a0...The equation that we\u2019re going to need to work with here is   not obvious.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the   following fact....\u00a0...Note that we need to make sure that the equation is equal   to ...\u00a0because of how we\u2019re going to work this problem.\u00a0 Now, basic right triangle trig tells us the   following,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Plugging these   into the equation above and solving for ...\u00a0gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Note that this   is the reason for the ...\u00a0in our equation.\u00a0 The inverse tangents give angles that are   in radians and so can\u2019t use the 180 that we\u2019re used to in this kind of   equation....\u00a0...Next we\u2019ll need   the derivative so hopefully you\u2019ll recall how to .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Setting this   equal to zero and solving give the following two critical points....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...The first critical point is not in the interval of   possible solutions and so we can exclude it....\u00a0...It\u2019s not difficult to show that if ...\u00a0that ...\u00a0and if ...\u00a0that ...\u00a0and so when ...\u00a0we will get the maximum value of .......\u00a0...A   trough for holding water is be formed by taking a piece of sheet metal 60 cm   wide and folding the 20 cm on either end up as shown below.\u00a0 Determine the angle ...\u00a0that will maximize the amount of water that   the trough can hold....Now, in this case we are being asked to maximize the   volume that a trough can hold, but if you think about it the volume of a   trough in this shape is nothing more than the cross-sectional area times the   length of the trough.\u00a0 So for a given   length in order to maximize the volume all you really need to do is maximize   the cross-sectional area....\u00a0...To get a formula for the cross-sectional area let\u2019s redo   the sketch above a little....\u00a0...We can think of the cross-sectional area as a rectangle in   the middle with width 20 and height ...   and two identical triangles on either end with height ..., base ... and   hypotenuse 20.\u00a0 Also note that basic   geometry tells us that the angle between the hypotenuse and the base must   also be the same angle ...\u00a0that we had in our original sketch....Also, basic right triangle trig tells us that the base and   height can be written as,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The   cross-sectional area for the whole trough, in terms of ...,   is then,...\u00a0...The derivative of the area is,...\u00a0...So, we have either,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...However, we can   see that ...\u00a0must be in the interval ...\u00a0or we won\u2019t get a trough in the proper   shape.\u00a0 Therefore, the second critical   point makes no sense and also note that we don\u2019t need to add on the standard   \u201c...\u201d for the same reason....\u00a0...Finally, since   the equation for the area is continuous all we need to do is plug in the   critical point and the end points to find the one that gives the maximum   area....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we will get   a maximum cross-sectional area,

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the previous section we saw how to use the derivative to determine the absolute minimum and maximum values of a function.\u00a0 However, there is a lot more information about a graph that can be determined from the first derivative of a function.\u00a0 We will start looking at that information in this section.\u00a0 The main idea we\u2019ll be looking at in this section we will be identifying all the relative extrema of a function.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start this section off by revisiting a familiar topic from the previous chapter.\u00a0 Let\u2019s suppose that we have a function, ....\u00a0 We know from our work in the previous chapter that the first derivative, ..., is the rate of change of the function.\u00a0 We used this idea to identify where a function was increasing, decreasing or not changing.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before reviewing this idea let\u2019s first write down the mathematical definition of increasing and decreasing.\u00a0 We all know what the graph of an increasing/decreasing function looks like but sometimes it is nice to have a mathematical definition as well.\u00a0 Here it is....\u00a0...1....Given   any ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0from an interval\u00a0 ...   with ...\u00a0if\u00a0 ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is ... on .......2....Given   any ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0from an interval\u00a0 ...   with ...\u00a0if\u00a0 ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is ... on .......\u00a0...This definition will actually be used in the proof of the next fact in this section....\u00a0...Now, recall that in the previous chapter we constantly used the idea that if the derivative of a function was positive at a point then the function was increasing at that point and if the derivative was negative at a point then the function was decreasing at that point.\u00a0 We also used the fact that if the derivative of a function was zero at a point then the function was not changing at that point.\u00a0 We used these ideas to identify the intervals in which a function is increasing and decreasing....\u00a0...The following fact summarizes up what we were doing in the previous chapter.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...1....If   ...\u00a0for every ... on some interval ...,   then ...\u00a0is increasing on the interval....2....If   ...\u00a0for every ... on some interval ...,   then ...\u00a0is decreasing on the interval....3....If   ...\u00a0for every ... on some interval ...,   then ...\u00a0is constant on the interval....\u00a0...The proof of this fact is in the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example.\u00a0 This example has two purposes.\u00a0 First, it will remind us of the increasing/decreasing type of problems that we were doing in the previous chapter.\u00a0 Secondly, and maybe more importantly, it will now incorporate critical points into the solution.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t know about critical points in the previous chapter, but if you go back and look at those examples, the first step in almost every increasing/decreasing problem is to find the critical points of the function....\u00a0...Determine   all intervals where the following function is increasing or decreasing....To determine if the function is increasing or decreasing   we will need the derivative....\u00a0...Note that when we factored the derivative we first   factored a \u201c-1\u201d out to make the rest of the factoring a little easier.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...From the factored form of the derivative we see that we   have three critical points : ...,   ...,   and ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll need these in a bit....\u00a0...We now need to determine where the derivative is positive   and where it\u2019s negative.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done   this several times now in both the Review chapter and the previous   chapter.\u00a0 Since the derivative is a   polynomial it is continuous and so we know that the only way for it to change   signs is to first go through zero....\u00a0...In other words, the only place that the derivative ... change signs is at the critical   points of the function.\u00a0 We\u2019ve now got   another use for critical points.\u00a0 So,   we\u2019ll build a number line, graph the critical points and pick test points   from each region to see if the derivative is positive or negative in each   region....\u00a0...Here is the number line and the test points for the   derivative....\u00a0...Make sure that you test your points in the   derivative.\u00a0 One of the more common   mistakes here is to test the points in the function instead!\u00a0 Recall that we know that the derivative   will be the same sign in each region.\u00a0   The only place that the derivative can change signs is at the critical   points and we\u2019ve marked the only critical points on the number line....\u00a0...So, it looks we\u2019ve got the following intervals of increase   and decrease....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...In this example we used the fact that the only place that a derivative can change sign is at the critical points.\u00a0 Also, the critical points for this function were those for which the derivative was zero.\u00a0 However, the same thing can be said for critical points where the derivative doesn\u2019t exist. \u00a0This is nice to know.\u00a0 A function can change signs where it is zero or doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 In the previous chapter all our examples of this type had only critical points where the derivative was zero.\u00a0 Now, that we know more about critical points we\u2019ll also see an example or two later on with critical points where the derivative doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Now that we have the previous \u201creminder\u201d example out of the way let\u2019s move into some new material.\u00a0 Once we have the intervals of increasing and decreasing for a function we can use this information to get a sketch of the graph.\u00a0 Note that the sketch, at this point, may not be super accurate when it comes to the curvature of the graph, but it will at least have the basic shape correct.\u00a0 To get the curvature of the graph correct we\u2019ll need the information from the next section....\u00a0...Let\u2019s attempt to get a sketch of the graph of the function we used in the previous example....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following function....There really isn\u2019t a whole lot to this example.\u00a0 Whenever we sketch a graph it\u2019s nice to   have a few points on the graph to give us a starting place.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll start by the function at the   critical points.\u00a0 These will give us   some starting points when we go to sketch the graph.\u00a0 These points are,...\u00a0...Once these points are graphed we go to the increasing and   decreasing information and start sketching.\u00a0   For reference purposes here is the increasing/decreasing information....\u00a0...Note that we are only after a sketch of the graph.\u00a0 As noted before we started this example we   won\u2019t be able to accurately predict the curvature of the graph at this   point.\u00a0 However, even without this   information we will still be able to get a basic idea of what the graph   should look like....\u00a0...To get this sketch we start at the very left of the graph   and knowing that the graph must be decreasing and will continue to decrease   until we get to ....\u00a0 At this point the function will continue to   increase until it gets to ....\u00a0 However, note that during the increasing   phase it does need to go through the point at ...\u00a0and at this point we also know that the   derivative is zero here and so the graph goes through ...horizontally.\u00a0 Finally, once we hit ...\u00a0the graph starts, and continues, to   decrease.\u00a0\u00a0 Also, note that just like   at ...\u00a0the graph will need to be horizontal when it   goes through the other two critical points as well. ...\u00a0...Here is the graph of the function.\u00a0 We, of course, used a graphical program to   generate this graph, however, outside of some potential curvature issues if   you followed the increasing/decreasing information and had all the critical   points plotted first you should have something similar to this. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s use the sketch from this example to give us a very nice test for classifying critical points as relative maximums, relative minimums or neither minimums or maximums....\u00a0...Recall ... from the Minimum and Maximum Values section.\u00a0 This theorem told us that all relative extrema (provided the derivative exists at that point of course) of a function will be critical points.\u00a0 The graph in the previous example has two relative extrema and both occur at critical points as the Fermat\u2019s Theorem predicted.\u00a0 Note as well that we\u2019ve got a critical point that isn\u2019t a relative extrema ( ...).\u00a0 This is okay since Fermat\u2019s theorem doesn\u2019t say that all critical points will be relative extrema.\u00a0 It only states that relative extrema will be critical points....\u00a0...In the sketch of the graph from the previous example we can see that to the left of ...\u00a0the graph is decreasing and to the right of ...\u00a0the graph is increasing and ...\u00a0is a relative minimum.\u00a0 In other words, the graph is behaving around the minimum exactly as it would have to be in order for ...\u00a0to be a minimum.\u00a0 The same thing can be said for the relative maximum at ...\u00a0 The graph is increasing on the left and decreasing on the right exactly as it must be in order for ...\u00a0to be a maximum.\u00a0 Finally, the graph is increasing on both sides of ...\u00a0and so this critical point can\u2019t be a minimum or a maximum....\u00a0...These ideas can be generalized to arrive at a nice way to test if a critical point is a relative minimum, relative maximum or neither.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0is a critical point and the function is decreasing to the left of ...\u00a0and is increasing to the right then ...\u00a0must be a relative minimum of the function.\u00a0 Likewise, if the function is increasing to the left of ...\u00a0and decreasing to the right then ...\u00a0must be a relative maximum of the function.\u00a0 Finally, if the function is increasing on both sides of ...\u00a0or decreasing on both sides of ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0can be neither a relative minimum nor a relative maximum. ...\u00a0...These ideas can be summarized up in the following test....\u00a0...Suppose that ...\u00a0is a critical point of ...\u00a0then,...\u00a0...1....If   ...\u00a0to the left of ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0to the right of ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is a relative maximum....2....If   ...\u00a0to the left of ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0to the right of ...\u00a0then ...is a relative minimum....3....If   ...\u00a0is the same sign on both sides of ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is neither a relative maximum nor a relative   minimum....\u00a0...\u00a0...It is important to note here that the first derivative test will only classify critical points as relative extrema and not as absolute extrema.\u00a0 As we recall from the ... section absolute extrema are largest and smallest function values and may not even exist or be critical points if they do exist.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first derivative test is exactly that, a test using the first derivative.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t ever use the value of the function and so no conclusions can be drawn from the test about the relative \u201csize\u201d of the function at the critical points (which would be needed to identify absolute extrema) and can\u2019t even begin to address the fact that absolute extrema may not occur at critical points....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take at another example....\u00a0...Find   and classify all the critical points of the following function.\u00a0 Give the intervals where the function is   increasing and decreasing....First we\u2019ll need the derivative so we can get our hands on   the critical points.\u00a0 Note as well that   we\u2019ll do some simplification on the derivative to help us find the critical   points....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ll have four critical points   here.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0...Finding the intervals of increasing and decreasing will   also give the classification of the critical points so let\u2019s get those   first.\u00a0 Here is a number line with the   critical points graphed and test points....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ve got the following intervals of   increasing and decreasing....\u00a0...From this it looks like ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are neither relative minimum or relative   maximums since the function is increasing on both side of them.\u00a0 On the other hand, ...\u00a0is a relative maximum and ...is a relative minimum....\u00a0...For completeness sake here is the graph of the function....\u00a0...In the previous example the two critical points where the derivative didn\u2019t exist ended up not being relative extrema.\u00a0 Do not read anything into this.\u00a0 They often will be relative extrema.\u00a0 Check out this ... in the Absolute Extrema to see an example of one such critical point....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple more examples....\u00a0...Suppose   that the elevation above sea level of a road is given by the following   function....where ... is in   miles.\u00a0 Assume that if ... is positive we are to the east of   the initial point of measurement and if ...   is negative we are to the west of the initial point of measurement.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If we start 25 miles to the west of the initial point of   measurement and drive until we are 25 miles east of the initial point how   many miles of our drive were we driving up an incline?...\u00a0...Okay, this is just a really fancy way of asking what the   intervals of increasing and decreasing are for the function on the interval   [-25,25].\u00a0 So, we first need the   derivative of the function....\u00a0...Setting this equal to zero gives,...\u00a0...The solutions to this and hence the critical points are,...\u00a0...I\u2019ll leave it to you to check that the critical points   that fall in the interval that we\u2019re after are,...\u00a0...Here is the number line with the critical points and test   points....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it looks like the intervals of increasing and   decreasing are,...\u00a0...Notice that we had to end our intervals at -25 and 25   since we\u2019ve done no work outside of these points and so we can\u2019t really say   anything about the function outside of the interval [-25,25].\u00a0 ...\u00a0...From the intervals we can actually answer the question.\u00a0   We were driving on an incline during the intervals of increasing and   so the total number of miles is,...\u00a0...Even though the problem didn\u2019t ask for it we can also   classify the critical points that are in the interval [-25,25]....\u00a0...The   population of rabbits (in hundreds) after ...   years in a certain area is given by the following function,...Determine if the population ever decreases in the first   two years....\u00a0...So, again we are really after the intervals and increasing   and decreasing in the interval [0,2]....\u00a0...We found the only critical point to this function back in   the ... section   to be,...\u00a0...Here is a number line for the intervals of increasing and   decreasing....\u00a0...So, it looks like the population will decrease for a short   period and then continue to increase forever....\u00a0...Also, while the problem didn\u2019t ask for it we can see   that\u00a0 the single critical point is a   relative minimum....\u00a0...In this section we\u2019ve seen how we can use the first derivative of a function to give us some information about the shape of a graph and how we can use this information in some applications....\u00a0...Using the first derivative to give us information about a whether a function is increasing or decreasing is a very important application of derivatives and arises on a fairly regular basis in many areas.", "url":

problem dealing with this application of derivatives.\u00a0 While this application will arise occasionally in this chapter we are going to focus more on other applications in this chapter....\u00a0...So, to make sure that we don\u2019t forget about this application here is a brief set of examples concentrating on the rate of change application of derivatives.\u00a0 Note that the point of these examples is to remind you of material covered in the previous chapter and not to teach you how to do these kinds of problems.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t recall how to do these kinds of examples you\u2019ll need to go back and review the previous chapter....\u00a0...Determine   all the points where the following function is not changing....First we\u2019ll need to take the derivative

positive then the function must be   increasing and if the derivative is negative then the function must be   decreasing.\u00a0 The following number line   gives this information....\u00a0...So, from

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Critical points will show up throughout a majority of this chapter so we first need to define them and work a few examples before getting into the sections that actually use them....\u00a0...We say that ...\u00a0is a critical point of the function ... if ...\u00a0exists and if either of the following are   true....\u00a0...Note that we require that ...\u00a0exists in order for ...\u00a0to actually be a critical point.\u00a0 This is an important, and often overlooked, point....\u00a0...The main point of this section is to work some examples finding critical points.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s work some examples....\u00a0...Determine   all the critical points for the function....\u00a0...We first need the derivative of the function in order to   find the critical points and so let\u2019s get that and notice that we\u2019ll factor   it as much as possible to make our life easier when we go to find the   critical points....\u00a0...Now, our derivative is a polynomial and so will exist   everywhere.\u00a0 Therefore the only   critical points will be those values of ...   which make the derivative zero.\u00a0 So, we   must solve....\u00a0...Because this is the factored form of the derivative it\u2019s   pretty easy to identify the three critical points.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0...Polynomials are usually fairly simple functions to find critical points for provided the degree doesn\u2019t get so large that we have trouble finding the roots of the derivative....\u00a0...Most of the more \u201cinteresting\u201d functions for finding critical points aren\u2019t polynomials however.\u00a0 So let\u2019s take a look at some functions that require a little more effort on our part....\u00a0...Determine   all the critical points for the function....\u00a0...To find the derivative it\u2019s probably easiest to do a   little simplification before we actually differentiate.\u00a0 Let\u2019s multiply the root through the   parenthesis and simplify as much as possible.\u00a0   This will allow us to avoid using the product rule when taking the   derivative....\u00a0...Now differentiate....\u00a0...We will need to be careful with this problem.\u00a0 When faced with a negative exponent it is   often best to eliminate the minus sign in the exponent as we did above.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t really required but it can make   our life easier on occasion if we do that.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Notice as well that eliminating the negative exponent in   the second term allows us to correctly identify why ...\u00a0is a critical point for this function.\u00a0 Once we move the second term to the   denominator we can clearly see that the derivative doesn\u2019t exist at ...\u00a0and so this will be a critical point.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t get rid of the negative   exponent in the second term many people will incorrectly state that ...\u00a0is a critical point because the derivative   is zero at ....\u00a0 While this may seem like a silly point,   after all in each case ...\u00a0is identified as a critical point, it is   sometimes important to know why a point is a critical point.\u00a0 In fact, in a couple of sections we\u2019ll see   a fact that only works for critical points in which the derivative is zero....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve found one critical point (where the derivative   doesn\u2019t exist), but we now need to determine where the derivative is zero   (provided it is of course\u2026).\u00a0 To help   with this it\u2019s usually best to combine the two terms into a single rational   expression.\u00a0 So, getting a common   denominator and combining gives us,...\u00a0...Notice that we still have ...\u00a0as a critical point.\u00a0 Doing this kind of combining should never   lose critical points, it\u2019s only being done to help us find them.\u00a0 As we can see it\u2019s now become much easier   to quickly determine where the derivative will be zero.\u00a0 Recall that a rational expression will only   be zero if its numerator is zero (and provided the denominator isn\u2019t also   zero at that point of course)....So, in this case we can see that the numerator will be   zero if ...\u00a0and so there are two critical points for   this function....\u00a0...Determine   all the critical points for the function....We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that using the quotient   rule we get that the derivative is,...Notice that we factored a \u201c-1\u201d out of the numerator to   help a little with finding the critical points.\u00a0 This negative out in front will not affect   the derivative whether or not the derivative is zero or not exist but will   make our work a little easier....\u00a0...Now, we have two issues to deal with.\u00a0 First the derivative will not exist if   there is division by zero in the denominator.\u00a0   So we need to solve,...\u00a0...We didn\u2019t bother squaring this since if this is zero, then   zero squared is still zero and if it isn\u2019t zero then squaring it won\u2019t make   it zero.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we can see from this that the derivative will not   exist at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 However, these are NOT critical points   since the function will also not exist at these points.\u00a0 Recall that in order for a point to be a   critical point the function must actually exist at that point....\u00a0...At this point we need to be careful.\u00a0 The numerator doesn\u2019t factor, but that   doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t any critical points where the derivative is   zero.\u00a0 We can use the quadratic formula   on the numerator to determine if the fraction as a whole is ever zero....\u00a0...So, we get two critical points.\u00a0 Also, these are not \u201cnice\u201d integers or   fractions.\u00a0 This will happen on   occasion.\u00a0 Don\u2019t get too locked into   answers always being \u201cnice\u201d.\u00a0 Often   they aren\u2019t....\u00a0...Note as well that we only use real numbers for critical   points.\u00a0 So, if upon solving the   quadratic in the numerator, we had gotten complex number these would not have   been considered critical points....\u00a0...Summarizing, we have two critical points.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0...Again, remember that while the derivative doesn\u2019t exist at   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0neither does the function and so these two   points are not critical points for this function. ...\u00a0...So far all the examples have not had any trig functions, exponential functions, .... in them.\u00a0 We shouldn\u2019t expect that to always be the case.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at some examples that don\u2019t just involve powers of .......\u00a0...Determine   all the critical points for the function....\u00a0...First get the derivative and don\u2019t forget to use the chain   rule on the second term....\u00a0...Now, this will exist everywhere and so there won\u2019t be any   critical points for which the derivative doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 The only critical points will come from   points that make the derivative zero.\u00a0   We will need to solve,...\u00a0...Solving this equation gives the following....\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget the ...   on these!\u00a0 There will be problems down   the road in which we will miss solutions without this!\u00a0 Also make sure that it gets put on at this   stage!\u00a0 Now divide by 3 to get all the   critical points for this function....\u00a0...Notice that in the previous example we got an infinite number of critical points.\u00a0 That will happen on occasion so don\u2019t worry about it when it happens....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Determine   all the critical points for the function....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the derivative for this function....\u00a0...Now, this looks unpleasant, however with a little   factoring we can clean things up a little as follows,...\u00a0...This function will exist everywhere and so no critical   points will come from that.\u00a0   Determining where this is zero is easier than it looks.\u00a0 We know that exponentials are never zero   and so the only way the derivative will be zero is if,...\u00a0...We will have two critical points for this function....\u00a0...Determine   all the critical points for the function....\u00a0...Before getting the derivative let\u2019s notice that since we   can\u2019t take the log of a negative number or zero we will only be able to look   at .......\u00a0...The derivative is then,...\u00a0...Now, this derivative will not exist if ... is a negative number or if ...,   but then again neither will the function and so these are not critical   points.\u00a0 Remember that the function   will only exist if ...\u00a0and nicely enough the derivative will also   only exist if ...\u00a0and so the only thing we need to worry about   is where the derivative is zero....\u00a0...First note that, despite appearances, the derivative will   not be zero for ....\u00a0 As noted above the derivative doesn\u2019t exist   at ...\u00a0because of the natural logarithm and so the   derivative can\u2019t be zero there!...\u00a0...So, the derivative will only be zero if,...\u00a0...Recall that we can solve this by exponentiating both   sides....\u00a0...There is a single critical point for this function....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one more problem to make a point....\u00a0...Determine   all the critical points for the function....Note that this function is not much different from the   function used in Example 5.\u00a0 In this   case the derivative is,...\u00a0...This function will never be zero for any real value of ....\u00a0   The exponential is never zero of course and the polynomial will only   be zero if ... is complex and recall   that we only want real values of ...   for critical points....\u00a0...Therefore, this function will not have any critical   points....\u00a0...It is important to note that not all functions will have critical points!\u00a0 In this course most of the functions that we will be looking at do have critical points.\u00a0 That is only because those problems make for more interesting examples.\u00a0 Do not let this fact lead you to always expect that a function will have critical points.\u00a0 Sometimes they don\u2019t as

domain and is the lowest point on the graph in an interval around it.\u00a0 The far right end point, ..., will not be a relative minimum since it is an end point....\u00a0...The function will have an absolute maximum at ...\u00a0and an absolute minimum at ....\u00a0 These two points are the largest and smallest that the function will ever be.\u00a0 We can also notice that the absolute extrema for a function will occur at either the endpoints of the domain or at relative extrema.\u00a0 We will use this idea in later sections so it\u2019s more important than it might seem at the present time....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at some examples to make sure that we have the definitions of absolute extrema and relative extrema straight....\u00a0...Identify   the absolute extrema and relative extrema for the following function....Since this function is easy enough to graph let\u2019s do   that.\u00a0 However, we only want the graph   on the interval [-1,2].\u00a0 Here is the   graph,...Note that we used dots at the end of the graph to remind   us that the graph ends at these points....\u00a0...We can now identify the extrema from the graph.\u00a0 It looks like we\u2019ve got a relative and   absolute minimum of zero at ...\u00a0and an absolute maximum of four at ....\u00a0 Note that ...\u00a0is not a relative maximum since it is at the   end point of the interval....\u00a0...This function doesn\u2019t have any relative maximums....\u00a0...As we saw in the previous example functions do not have to have relative extrema.\u00a0 It is completely possible for a function to not have a relative maximum and/or a relative minimum....\u00a0...Identify   the absolute extrema and relative extrema for the following function....Here is the graph for this function....In this case we still have a relative and absolute minimum   of zero at ....\u00a0 We also still have an absolute maximum of   four.\u00a0 However, unlike the first   example this will occur at two points, ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Again, the function doesn\u2019t have any relative maximums....\u00a0...As this example has shown there can only be a single absolute maximum or absolute minimum value, but they can occur at more than one place in the domain....\u00a0...Identify   the absolute extrema and relative extrema for the following function....In this case we\u2019ve given no domain and so the assumption   is that we will take the largest possible domain.\u00a0 For this function that means all the real   numbers.\u00a0 Here is the graph....\u00a0...In this case the graph doesn\u2019t stop increasing at either   end and so there are no maximums of any kind for this function.\u00a0 No matter which point we pick on the graph   there will be points both larger and smaller than it on either side so we can\u2019t   have any maximums (or any kind, relative or absolute) in a graph....\u00a0...We still have a relative and absolute minimum value of   zero at .......\u00a0...So, some graphs can have minimums but not maximums.\u00a0 Likewise, a graph could have maximums but not minimums....\u00a0...Identify   the absolute extrema and relative extrema for the following function....Here is the graph for this function....\u00a0...This function has an absolute maximum of eight at ...\u00a0and an absolute minimum of negative eight at   ....\u00a0 This function has no relative extrema....\u00a0...So, a function doesn\u2019t have to have relative extrema as this example has shown....\u00a0...Identify   the absolute extrema and relative extrema for the following function....Again, we aren\u2019t restricting the domain this time so   here\u2019s the graph....In this case the function has no relative extrema and no   absolute extrema....\u00a0...As we\u2019ve seen in the previous example functions don\u2019t have to have any kind of extrema, relative or absolute....\u00a0...Identify   the absolute extrema and relative extrema for the following function....We\u2019ve not restricted the domain for this function.\u00a0 Here is the graph....Cosine has extrema (relative and absolute) that occur at   many points.\u00a0 Cosine has both relative   and absolute maximums of 1 at...Cosine also has both relative and absolute minimums of -1   at...\u00a0...As this example has shown a graph can in fact have extrema occurring at a large number (infinite in this case) of points....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now worked quite a few examples and we can use these examples to see a nice fact about absolute extrema.\u00a0 First let\u2019s notice that all the functions above were ... functions.\u00a0 Next notice that every time we restricted the domain to a closed interval (... the interval contains its end points) we got absolute maximums and absolute minimums.\u00a0 Finally, in only one of the three examples in which we did not restrict the domain did we get both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum....\u00a0...These observations lead us the following theorem....\u00a0...Suppose that ...\u00a0is continuous on the interval [...] then there are two numbers ...so that ...\u00a0is an absolute maximum for the function and ...\u00a0is an absolute minimum for the function....\u00a0...So, if we have a continuous function on an interval [...] then we are guaranteed to have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum for the function somewhere in the interval.\u00a0 The theorem doesn\u2019t tell us where they will occur or if they will occur more than once, but at least it tells us that they do exist somewhere.\u00a0 Sometimes, all that we need to know is that they do exist....\u00a0...This theorem doesn\u2019t say anything about absolute extrema if we aren\u2019t working on an interval.\u00a0 We saw examples of functions above that had both absolute extrema, one absolute extrema, and no absolute extrema when we didn\u2019t restrict ourselves down to an interval....\u00a0...The requirement that a function be continuous is also required in order for us to use the theorem.\u00a0 Consider the case of ...Here\u2019s the graph....\u00a0...This function is not continuous at ...as we move in towards zero the function is approaching infinity.\u00a0 So, the function does not have an absolute maximum.\u00a0 Note that it does have an absolute minimum however.\u00a0 In fact the absolute minimum occurs twice at both ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...If we changed the interval a little to say,...the function would now have both absolute extrema.\u00a0 We may only run into problems if the interval contains the point of discontinuity.\u00a0 If it doesn\u2019t then the theorem will hold....\u00a0...We should also point out that just because a function is not continuous at a point that doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t have both absolute extrema in an interval that contains that point.\u00a0 Below is the graph of a function that is not continuous at a point in the given interval and yet has both absolute extrema....\u00a0...This graph is not continuous at ..., yet it does have both an absolute maximum ( ...) and an absolute minimum ( ...).\u00a0 Also note that, in this case one of the absolute extrema occurred at the point of discontinuity, but it doesn\u2019t need to.\u00a0 The absolute minimum could just have easily been at the other end point or at some other point interior to the region.\u00a0 The point here is that this graph is not continuous and yet does have both absolute extrema...\u00a0...The point of all this is that we need to be careful to only use the Extreme Value Theorem when the conditions of the theorem are met and not misinterpret the results if the conditions aren\u2019t met.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In order to use the Extreme Value Theorem we must have an interval and the function must be continuous on that interval.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t have an interval and/or the function isn\u2019t continuous on the interval then the function may or may not have absolute extrema....\u00a0...We need to discuss one final topic in this section before moving on to the first major application of the derivative that we\u2019re going to be looking at in this chapter....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0has a relative extrema at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0exists then ...\u00a0is a critical point of ....\u00a0 In fact, it will be a critical point such   that .......\u00a0...Note that we can say that ...\u00a0because we are also assuming that ...\u00a0exists....\u00a0...This theorem tells us that there is a nice relationship between relative extrema and critical points.\u00a0 In fact it will allow us to get a list of all possible relative extrema.\u00a0 Since a relative extrema must be a critical point the list of all critical points will give us a list of all possible relative extrema....\u00a0...Consider the case of ....\u00a0 We saw that this function had a relative minimum at ...\u00a0in several earlier examples.\u00a0 So according to Fermat\u2019s theorem ...\u00a0should be a critical point.\u00a0 The derivative of the function is,...Sure enough ...\u00a0is a critical point....\u00a0...Be careful not to misuse this theorem.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t say that a critical point will be a relative extrema.\u00a0 To see this, consider the following case....\u00a0...Clearly ...\u00a0is a critical point.\u00a0 However we saw in an earlier example this function has no relative extrema of any kind.\u00a0 So, critical points do not have to be relative extrema....\u00a0...Also note that this theorem says nothing about absolute extrema.\u00a0 An absolute extrema may or may not be a critical point....\u00a0...To see the proof of this theorem see the ... section of the Extras chapter.", "url":

derivative,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...For the second   function we didn\u2019t bother this time with using ...\u00a0and just jumped straight to ...\u00a0for the general version.\u00a0 This is still just a general version of   what we did for the first function.\u00a0   The outside function is still the sine and the inside is given by ...\u00a0and while we don\u2019t have a formula for ...\u00a0and so we can\u2019t actually take its derivative   we do have a notation for its derivative.\u00a0   Here is the derivative for this function,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...,\u00a0 ...In this part we\u2019ll just give the answers for each and   leave out the explanation that we had in the first two parts....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this set of examples we were just doing some chain rule problems where the inside function was ...\u00a0instead of a specific function.\u00a0 This kind of derivative shows up all the time in doing implicit differentiation so we need to make sure that we can do them.\u00a0 Also note that we only did this for three kinds of functions but there are many more kinds of functions that we could have used here....\u00a0...So, it\u2019s now time to do our first problem where implicit differentiation is required, unlike the first example where we could actually avoid implicit differentiation by solving for .......\u00a0...Find   ...\u00a0for the following function....Now, this is just a circle and we can solve for ... which would give,...\u00a0...Prior to starting this problem we stated that we had to do   implicit differentiation here because we couldn\u2019t just solve for ... and yet that\u2019s what we just   did.\u00a0 So, why can\u2019t we use \"normal\"   differentiation here?\u00a0 The problem is   the \u201c ...\u201d.\u00a0   With this in the \u201csolution\u201d for ...   we see that ... is in fact two   different functions.\u00a0 Which should we   use?\u00a0 Should we use both?\u00a0 We only want a single function for the   derivative and at best we have two functions here....\u00a0...So, in this example we really are going to need to do   implicit differentiation so we can avoid this.\u00a0 In this example we\u2019ll do the same thing we   did in the first example and remind ourselves that ... is really a function of ...   and write ... as ....\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve done this all we need to do is   differentiate each term with respect to .......\u00a0...As with the first example the right side is easy.\u00a0 The left side is also pretty easy since all   we need to do is take the derivative of each term and note that the second   term will be similar the part (a) of the second example.\u00a0 All we need to do for the second term is   use the chain rule....\u00a0...After taking the derivative we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...At this point we can drop the ...\u00a0part as it was only in the problem to help   with the differentiation process.\u00a0 The   final step is to simply solve the resulting equation for .......\u00a0...Unlike the first example we can\u2019t just plug in for ... since we wouldn\u2019t know which of the   two functions to use.\u00a0 Most answers   from implicit differentiation will involve both ... and ... so don\u2019t get   excited about that when it happens....\u00a0...As always, we can\u2019t forget our interpretations of derivatives....\u00a0...Find   the equation of the tangent line to ...at the point .......\u00a0...First note that unlike all the other tangent line problems   we\u2019ve done in previous sections we need to be given both the ... and the ... values of the point.\u00a0   Notice as well that this point does lie on the graph of the circle   (you can check by plugging the points into the equation) and so it\u2019s okay to   talk about the tangent line at this point. ...\u00a0...Recall that to write down the tangent line we need is the slope of the tangent line and this is nothing more than the derivative   evaluated at the given point.\u00a0 We\u2019ve   got the derivative from the previous example so as we need to do is plug in   the given point....\u00a0...The tangent line is then....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s work some more examples.\u00a0 In the remaining examples we will no longer write ...\u00a0for ....\u00a0 This is just something that we were doing to remind ourselves that ... is really a function of ... to help with the derivatives. Seeing the ...\u00a0reminded us that we needed to do the chain rule on that portion of the problem.\u00a0 From this point on we\u2019ll leave the ...\u2019s written as ...\u2019s and in our head we\u2019ll need to remember that they really are ...\u00a0and that we\u2019ll need to do the chain rule....\u00a0...There is an easy way to remember how to do the chain rule in these problems.\u00a0 The chain rule really tells us to differentiate the function as we usually would, except we need to add on a derivative of the inside function.\u00a0 In implicit differentiation this means that every time we are differentiating a term with ... in it the inside function is the ... and we will need to add a ...\u00a0onto the term since that will be the derivative of the inside function....\u00a0...Let\u2019s see a couple of examples....\u00a0...Find   ...\u00a0for each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...First differentiate both sides with respect to ... and remember that each ... is really ...\u00a0we just aren\u2019t going to write it that way   anymore.\u00a0 This means that the first   term on the left will be a product rule.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...We differentiated these kinds of functions involving ...\u2019s to a power with the chain rule in   the ... above.\u00a0 Also, recall the discussion prior to the   start of this problem.\u00a0 When doing this   kind of chain rule problem all that we need to do is differentiate the ...\u2019s as normal and then add on a ...,   which is nothing more than the derivative of the \u201cinside function\u201d....\u00a0...Here is the differentiation of each side for this   function....\u00a0...Now all that we need to do is solve for the derivative, ....\u00a0 This is just basic solving algebra that you   are capable of doing.\u00a0 The main problem   is that it\u2019s liable to be messier than what you\u2019re used to doing.\u00a0 All we need to do is get all the terms with   ...\u00a0in them on one side and all the terms   without ...\u00a0in them on the other.\u00a0 Then factor ...\u00a0out of all the terms containing it and   divide both sides by the \u201ccoefficient\u201d of the ....\u00a0 Here is the solving work for this one,...\u00a0...The algebra in these problems can be quite messy so be   careful with that....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ve got two product rules to deal with this time.\u00a0 Here is the derivative of this function....\u00a0...Notice the derivative tacked onto the secant!\u00a0 Again, this is just a chain rule problem   similar to the second part of Example 2 above....\u00a0...Now, solve for the derivative.... ...We\u2019re going to need to be careful with this problem.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a couple chain rules that we\u2019re   going to need to deal with here that are a little different from those that   we\u2019ve dealt with prior to this problem.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...In both the exponential and the logarithm we\u2019ve got a   \u201cstandard\u201d chain rule in that there is something other than just an ... or ... inside the exponential and logarithm.\u00a0 So, this means we\u2019ll do the chain rule as   usual here and then when we do the derivative of the inside function for each   term we\u2019ll have to deal with differentiating ...\u2019s....\u00a0...Here is the derivative of this equation....\u00a0...In both of the chain rules note that the ...\u00a0didn\u2019t get tacked on until we actually   differentiated the ...\u2019s in that   term.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now we need to solve for the derivative and this is liable   to be somewhat messy.\u00a0 In order to get   the ...\u00a0on one side we\u2019ll need to multiply the   exponential through the parenthesis and break up the quotient....\u00a0...Note that to make the derivative at least look a little   nicer we converted all the fractions to negative exponents....\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve seen one application of implicit differentiation in the tangent line example above.\u00a0 However, there is another application that we will be seeing in every problem in\u00a0 the next section....\u00a0...In some cases we will have two (or more) functions all of which are functions of a third variable.\u00a0 So, we might have ...\u00a0and\u00a0 ..., for example and in these cases we will be differentiating with respect to ....\u00a0 This is just implicit differentiation like we did in the previous examples, but there is a difference however.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the previous examples we have functions involving ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s and thinking of ... as ....\u00a0 In these problems we differentiated with respect to ... and so when faced with ...\u2019s in the function we differentiated as normal and when faced with ...\u2019s we differentiated as normal except we then added a ...\u00a0onto that term because we were really doing a chain rule....\u00a0...In the new example we want to look at we\u2019re assuming that ...\u00a0and that ...\u00a0and differentiating with respect to ....\u00a0 This means that every time we are faced with an ... or a ... we\u2019ll be doing the chain rule.\u00a0 This in turn means that when we differentiate an ... we will need to add on an ...\u00a0and whenever we differentiate a ... we will add on a .......\u00a0...These new types of problems are really the same kind of problem we\u2019ve been doing in this section.\u00a0 They are just expanded out a little to include more than one function that will require a chain rule....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example of this kind of problem....\u00a0...Assume   that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and differentiate the following equation   with respect to .......So, just differentiate as normal and add on an appropriate   derivative at each step.\u00a0 Note as well   that the first term will be a product rule since both ... and ... are functions   of .......\u00a0...\u00a0...There really isn\u2019t all that much to this problem.\u00a0 Since there are two derivatives in the   problem we won\u2019t be bothering to solve for one of them.\u00a0 When we do this kind of problem in the next   section the problem will imply which one we need to solve for....\u00a0...At this point there doesn\u2019t seem be any real reason for doing this kind of problem, but as we\u2019ll see in the next section every problem that we\u2019ll be doing there will involve this kind of implicit differentiation.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ImplicitDiff.aspx", "media": "text",

products and quotients and see why....\u00a0...First let\u2019s take a look at why we have to be careful with products and quotients.\u00a0 Suppose that we have the two functions ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s start by computing the derivative of the product of these two functions.\u00a0 This is easy enough to do directly....\u00a0...Remember that on occasion we will drop the ... part on the functions to simplify notation somewhat.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done that in the work above....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s try the following....\u00a0...So, we can very quickly see that....In other words, the derivative of a product is not the product of the derivatives....\u00a0...Using the same functions we can do the same thing for quotients....So, again we can see that,...\u00a0...To differentiate products and quotients we have the ... and the .......\u00a0...If the two functions ...   and ... are differentiable (... the derivative exist) then the   product is differentiable and,...\u00a0...The proof of the Product Rule is shown in the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...If the two functions\u00a0   ... and ... are differentiable (... the derivative exist) then the   quotient is differentiable and,...\u00a0...Note that the numerator of the quotient rule is very similar to the product rule so be careful to not mix the two up!...\u00a0...The proof of the Quotient Rule is shown in the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a couple of examples of the product rule....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...At this point there really aren\u2019t a lot of reasons to use   the product rule.\u00a0 As we noted in the   previous section all we would need to do for either of these is to just   multiply out the product and then differentiate.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...With that said we will use the product rule on these so we   can see an example or two.\u00a0 As we add   more functions to our repertoire and as the functions become more complicated   the product rule will become more useful and in many cases required....\u00a0... ...Note that we took the derivative of this function in the   previous ... and didn\u2019t   use the product rule at that point.\u00a0 We   should however get the same result here as we did then....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s do the problem here.\u00a0 There\u2019s not really a lot to do here other   than use the product rule.\u00a0 However,   before doing that we should convert the radical to a fractional exponent as   always....Now let\u2019s take the derivative.\u00a0 So we take the derivative of the first   function times the second then add on to that the first function times the   derivative of the second function....\u00a0...This is NOT what we got in the previous section for this   derivative.\u00a0 However, with some   simplification we can arrive at the same answer....\u00a0...This is what we got for an answer in the previous section   so that is a good check of the product rule....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...This one is actually easier than the previous one.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just run it through the product rule....\u00a0...Since it was easy to do we went ahead and simplified the   results a little....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now work an example or two with the quotient rule.\u00a0 In this case, unlike the product rule examples, a couple of these functions will require the quotient rule in order to get the derivative.\u00a0 The last two however, we can avoid the quotient rule if we\u2019d like to as we\u2019ll see....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...There isn\u2019t a lot to do here other than to use the   quotient rule.\u00a0 Here is the work for   this function....\u00a0... ...Again, not much to do here other than use the quotient   rule.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to convert the   square root into a fractional exponent....\u00a0... ...It seems strange to have this one here rather than being   the first part of this example given that it definitely appears to be easier   than any of the previous two.\u00a0 In fact,   it is easier.\u00a0 There is a point to   doing it here rather than first.\u00a0 In   this case there are two ways to do compute this derivative.\u00a0 There is an easy way and a hard way and in   this case the hard way is the quotient rule.\u00a0   That\u2019s the point of this example....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do the quotient rule and see what we get....\u00a0...Now, that was the \u201chard\u201d way.\u00a0 So, what was so hard about it?\u00a0 Well actually it wasn\u2019t that hard, there is   just an easier way to do it that\u2019s all.\u00a0   However, having said that, a common mistake here is to do the   derivative of the numerator (a constant) incorrectly.\u00a0 For some reason many people will give the   derivative of the numerator in these kinds of problems as a 1 instead of 0!\u00a0 Also, there is some simplification that   needs to be done in these kinds of problems if you do the quotient rule....\u00a0...The easy way is to do what we did in the previous section....\u00a0...Either way will work, but I\u2019d rather take the easier route   if I had the choice....\u00a0... ...This problem also seems a little out of place.\u00a0 However, it is here again to make a   point.\u00a0 Do not confuse this with a   quotient rule problem.\u00a0 While you can   do the quotient rule on this function there is no reason to use the quotient   rule on this.\u00a0 Simply rewrite the   function as...and differentiate as always....\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s not forget about our applications of derivatives....\u00a0...Suppose   that the amount of air in a balloon at any time ... is given by...Determine if the balloon is being filled with air or being   drained of air at .......\u00a0...If the balloon is being filled with air then the volume is   increasing and if it\u2019s being drained of air then the volume will be   decreasing.\u00a0 In other words, we need to   get the derivative so that we can determine the rate of change of the volume   at ...\u00a0...This will require the quotient rule....\u00a0...Note that we simplified the numerator more than usual   here.\u00a0 This was only done to make the   derivative easier to evaluate....\u00a0...The rate of change of the volume at ...\u00a0is then,...\u00a0...So, the rate of change of the volume at ...\u00a0is negative and so the volume must be   decreasing.\u00a0 Therefore air is being   drained out of the balloon at .......\u00a0...As a final topic let\u2019s note that the product rule can be extended to more than two functions, for instance....\u00a0...With this section and the previous section we are now able to differentiate powers of ... as well as sums, differences, products and quotients of these kinds of functions.\u00a0 However, there are many more functions out there in the world that are not in this form.\u00a0 The next few sections give many of these functions as well as give their derivatives.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ProductQuotientRule.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Product and Quotient Rule",

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to look at an application of implicit differentiation.\u00a0 Most of the applications of derivatives are in the next chapter however there are a couple of reasons for placing it in this chapter as opposed to putting it into the next chapter with the other applications.\u00a0 The first reason is that it\u2019s an application of implicit differentiation and so putting it right after that section means that we won\u2019t have forgotten how to do implicit differentiation.\u00a0 The other reason is simply that after doing all these derivatives we need to be reminded that there really are actual applications to derivatives.\u00a0 Sometimes it is easy to forget there really is a reason that we\u2019re spending all this time on derivatives....\u00a0...For these related rates problems it\u2019s usually best to just jump right into some problems and see how they work....\u00a0...Air   is being pumped into a spherical balloon at a rate of 5 cm.../min.\u00a0 Determine the rate at which the radius of   the balloon is increasing when the diameter of the balloon is 20 cm....\u00a0...The first thing that we\u2019ll need to do here is to identify   what information that we\u2019ve been given and what we want to find.\u00a0 Before we do that let\u2019s notice that both   the volume of the balloon and the radius of the balloon will vary with time   and so are really functions of time, ...   ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...We know that air is being pumped into the balloon at a   rate of 5 cm.../min.\u00a0 This is   the rate at which the volume is increasing.\u00a0   Recall that rates of change are nothing more than derivatives and so   we know that,...\u00a0...We want to determine the rate at which the radius is   changing.\u00a0 Again, rates are derivatives   and so it looks like we want to determine,...Note that we needed to convert the diameter to a radius....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve identified what we have been given and what   we want to find we need to relate these two quantities to each other.\u00a0 In this case we can relate the volume and   the radius with the formula for the volume of a sphere....\u00a0...As in the previous section when we looked at implicit   differentiation, we will typically not use the ...\u00a0part of things in the formulas, but since   this is the first time through one of these we will do that to remind   ourselves that they are really functions of .......\u00a0...Now we don\u2019t really want a relationship between the volume   and the radius.\u00a0 What we really want is   a relationship between their derivatives.\u00a0   We can do this by differentiating both sides with respect to ....\u00a0   In other words, we will need to do implicit differentiation on the   above formula.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Note that at this point we went ahead and dropped the ...\u00a0from each of the terms.\u00a0 Now all that we need to do is plug in what   we know and solve for what we want to find....\u00a0...We can get the units of the derivative by recalling that,...The units of the derivative will be the units of the numerator (cm in the previous example) divided by the units of the denominator (min in the previous example)....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...A   15 foot ladder is resting against the wall.\u00a0   The bottom is initially 10 feet away from the wall and is being pushed   towards the wall at a rate of ...\u00a0ft/sec.\u00a0   How fast is the top of the ladder moving up the wall 12 seconds after   we start pushing?...\u00a0...The first thing to do in this case is to sketch picture   that shows us what is going on....We\u2019ve defined the distance of the bottom of the ladder   from the wall to be ... and the   distance of the top of the ladder from the floor to be ....\u00a0 Note as well that these   are changing with time and so we really should write ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 However, as is often the case with related   rates/implicit differentiation problems we don\u2019t write the ...\u00a0part just try to remember this in our heads   as we proceed with the problem....\u00a0...Next we need to identify what we know and what we want to   find.\u00a0 We know that the rate at which   the bottom of the ladder is moving towards the wall.\u00a0 This is,...Note as well that the rate is negative since the distance   from the wall, ..., is   decreasing.\u00a0 We always need to be   careful with signs with these problems.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...We want to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is   moving away from the floor.\u00a0 This is ....\u00a0 Note as well that this quantity should be   positive since ... will be increasing....\u00a0...As with the first example we first need a relationship   between ... and ....\u00a0 We can get this using   Pythagorean theorem....\u00a0...All that we need to do at this point is to differentiate   both sides with respect to ...,   remembering that ... and ... are really functions of ... and so we\u2019ll need to do implicit   differentiation.\u00a0 Doing this gives an   equation that shows the relationship between the derivatives. ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s see which of the various parts of this   equation that we know and what we need to find.\u00a0 We know ...\u00a0and are being asked to determine ...\u00a0so it\u2019s okay that we don\u2019t know that.\u00a0 However, we still need to determine ... and ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Determining ...   and ... is actually fairly   simple.\u00a0 We know that initially ...\u00a0and the end is being pushed in towards the   wall at a rate of ...ft/sec and that we are interested in   what has happened after 12 seconds.\u00a0 We   know that,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the end of   the ladder has been pushed in 3 feet and so after 12 seconds we must have ....\u00a0 Note that we could have computed this in   one step as follows,...\u00a0...To find ... (after   12 seconds) all that we need to do is reuse the Pythagorean Theorem with the   values of ... that we just found   above....\u00a0...Now all that we need to do is plug into ...   and solve for .......Notice that we got the correct sign for ....\u00a0 If we\u2019d gotten a negative then we\u2019d have   known that we had made a mistake and we could go back and look for it....\u00a0...Two   people are 50 feet apart.\u00a0 One of them   starts walking north at a rate so that the angle shown in the diagram below   is changing at a constant rate of 0.01 rad/min.\u00a0 At what rate is distance between the two   people changing when ...\u00a0radians?...This example is not as tricky as it might at first   appear.\u00a0 Let\u2019s call the distance   between them at any point in time ...   as noted above.\u00a0 We can then relate all   the known quantities by one of two trig formulas....\u00a0...We want to find ...and we could find ... if we wanted to at the point in   question using cosine since we also know the angle at that point in   time.\u00a0 However, if we use the second   formula we won\u2019t need to know ... as   you\u2019ll see.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s differentiate   that formula....\u00a0...As noted, there are no ...\u2019s   in this formula.\u00a0 We want to determine ...\u00a0and we know that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0(do you agree with it being positive?).\u00a0 So, just plug in and solve....\u00a0...So far we we\u2019ve seen three related rates problems.\u00a0 While each one was worked in a very different manner the process was essentially the same in each.\u00a0 In each problem we identified what we were given and what we wanted to find.\u00a0 We next wrote down a relationship between all the various quantities and used implicit differentiation to arrive at a relationship between the various derivatives in the problem.\u00a0 Finally, we plugged into the equation to find the value we were after....\u00a0...So, in a general sense each problem was worked in pretty much the same manner.\u00a0 The only real difference between them was coming up with the relationship between the known and unknown quantities.\u00a0 This is often the hardest part of the problem.\u00a0 In many problems the best way to come up with the relationship is to sketch a diagram that shows the situation.\u00a0 This often seems like a silly step, but can make all the difference in whether we can find the relationship or not. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another problem that uses some different ideas and shows some of the different kinds of things that can show up in related rates problems....\u00a0...A   tank of water in the shape of a cone is leaking water at a constant rate of ....\u00a0 The base radius of the tank is 5 ft and the   height of the tank is 14 ft.\u00a0 ...At   what rate is the depth of the water in the tank changing when the depth of   the water is 6 ft? ...   ...   ...At   what rate is the radius of the top of the water in the tank changing when the   depth of the water is 6 ft?...\u00a0...Okay, we should probably start off with a quick sketch   (probably not to scale) of what is going on here....\u00a0...As we can see, the water in the tank actually forms a   smaller cone with the same central angle as the tank itself.\u00a0 The radius of the \u201cwater\u201d cone at any time   is given by ... and the height of the   \u201cwater\u201d cone at any time is given by ....\u00a0 The volume of water in the tank at any time   ... is given by,...and we\u2019ve been given that .......\u00a0... ...\u00a0...For this part we need to determine ...\u00a0when ...\u00a0and now we have a problem.\u00a0 The only formula that we\u2019ve got that will   relate the volume to the height also includes the radius and so if we were to   differentiate this with respect to ...   we would get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in this   equation we know ...\u00a0and ...   and want to find ...,   but we don\u2019t know ... and ....\u00a0 As we\u2019ll see finding ... isn\u2019t too bad, but we just don\u2019t have enough information, at   this point, that will allow us to find ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0simultaneously.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To fix this   we\u2019ll need to eliminate the ... from   the volume formula in some way.\u00a0 This   is actually easier than it might at first look.\u00a0 If we go back to our sketch above and look   at just the right half of the tank we see that we have two similar triangles   and when we say similar we mean similar in the geometric sense.\u00a0 Recall that two triangles are called   similar if their angles are identical, which is the case here.\u00a0 When we have two similar triangles then   ratios of any two sides will be equal.\u00a0   For our set this means that we have,...\u00a0...If we take this and plugit into our volume formula we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This gives us a   volume formula that only involved the volume and the height of the   water.\u00a0 Note however that this volume   formula is only valid for our cone, so don\u2019t be tempted to use it for other   cones!\u00a0 If we now differentiate this we   have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...At this point   all we need to do is plug in what we know and solve for .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, it looks   like the height is decreasing at a rate of 0.1386 ft/hr....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case we   are asking for ...\u00a0and there is an easy way to do this part and   a difficult (well, more difficult than the easy way anyway\u2026.) way to do   it.\u00a0 The \u201cdifficult\u201d way is to redo the   work in part (a) above only this time use,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...to get the   volume in terms of ... and ... and then proceed as before....\u00a0...That\u2019s not   terribly difficult, but it is more work that we need to so.\u00a0 Recall from the first part that we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, as we can   see if we take the relationship that relates ... and ... that we used in   the first part and differentiate it we get a relationship between ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 At this point all we need to do here is use   the result from the first part to get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Much easier that redoing all of the first part.\u00a0 Note however, that we were only able to do   this the \u201ceasier\u201d way because it was asking for ...at exactly the same time that we   asked for ...\u00a0in the first part.\u00a0 If we hadn\u2019t been using the same time then   we would have had no choice but to do this the \u201cdifficult\u201d way....\u00a0...In the second part of the previous problem we saw an important idea in dealing with related rates.\u00a0 In order to find the asked for rate all we need is an equation that relates the rate we\u2019re looking for to a rate that we already know.\u00a0 Sometimes there are multiple equations that we can use and sometimes one will be easier than another....\u00a0...Also, this problem showed us that we will often have an equation that contains more variables that we have information about and so, in these cases, we will need to eliminate one (or more) of the variables.\u00a0 In this problem we eliminated the extra variable using the idea of similar triangles.\u00a0 This will not always be how we do this, but many of these problems do use similar triangles so make sure you can use that idea....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some more problems....\u00a0...A   trough of water is 8 meters deep and its ends are in the shape of isosceles   triangles whose width is 5 meters and height is 2 meters.\u00a0 If water is being pumped in at a constant   rate of ....\u00a0 At what rate is the height of the water   changing when the water has a height of 120 cm?...\u00a0...Note that an isosceles triangle is just a triangle in   which two of the sides are the same length.\u00a0   In our case sides of the tank have the same length. ...\u00a0...We definitely need a sketch of this situation to get us   going here so here.\u00a0 A sketch of the   trough is shown below....Now, in this problem we know that ...\u00a0and we want to determine ...\u00a0when ....\u00a0 Note that because ...\u00a0is in terms of meters we need to convert ... into meters as well.\u00a0 So, we need an equation that will relate   these two quantities and the volume of the tank will do it....\u00a0...The volume of this kind of tank is simple to compute.\u00a0 The volume is the area of the end times the   depth.\u00a0 For our case the volume of the   water in the tank is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the   previous example we\u2019ve got an extra quantity here, ..., that is also changing with time and so we need to eliminate it from the problem.\u00a0 To do   this we\u2019ll again make use of the idea of similar triangles.\u00a0 If we look at the end of the tank we\u2019ll see   that we again have two similar triangles.\u00a0   One for the tank itself and one formed by the water in the tank.\u00a0 Again, remember that with similar triangles ratios of sides must be equal.\u00a0 In   our case we\u2019ll use,...\u00a0...Plugging this into the volume gives a formula for the   volume (and only for this tank) that only involved the height of the water....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We can now   differentiate this to get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally, all we   need to do is plug in and solve for .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the height   of the water is rising at a rate of 0.25 m/sec....\u00a0...A   light is on the top of a 12 ft tall pole and a 5ft 6in tall person is walking   away from the pole at a rate of 2 ft/sec....At   what rate is the tip of the shadow moving away from the pole when the person   is 25 ft from the pole?...At   what rate is the tip of the shadow moving away from the person when the   person is 25 ft from the pole?...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ll definitely need a sketch of this situation to get us   started here.\u00a0 The tip of the shadow is   defined by the rays of light just getting past the person and so we can form   the following set of similar triangles....Here ... is the   distance of the tip of the shadow from the pole, ...\u00a0is the distance of the

follows....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we   factored the 6 in the numerator out of the limit.\u00a0 At this point, while it may not look like   it, we can use the fact above to finish the limit.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To see that we   can use the fact on this limit let\u2019s do a ....\u00a0 A   change of variables is really just a renaming of portions of the problem to   make something look more like something we know how to deal with.\u00a0 They can\u2019t always be done, but sometimes,   such as this case, they can simplify the problem.\u00a0 The change of variables here is to let ...\u00a0and then notice that as ...\u00a0we also have ... ....\u00a0 When doing a change of variables in a limit   we need to change all the ...\u2019s into ...\u2019s and that includes the one in the   limit....\u00a0...Doing the   change of variables on this limit gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...And there we are.\u00a0   Note that we didn\u2019t really need to do a change of variables here.\u00a0 All we really need to notice is that the   argument of the sine is the same as the denominator and then we can use the   fact.\u00a0 A change of variables, in this   case, is really only needed to make it clear that the fact does work....\u00a0... ...In this case we appear to have a small problem in that the   function we\u2019re taking the limit of here is upside down compared to that in   the fact.\u00a0 This is not the problem it   appears to be once we notice that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and then all we   need to do is recall a nice property of limits that allows us to do ,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...With a little   rewriting we can see that we do in fact end up needing to do a limit like the   one we did in the previous part.\u00a0 So,   let\u2019s do the limit here and this time we won\u2019t bother with a change of   variable to help us out.\u00a0 All we need   to do is multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction in the   denominator by 7 to get things set up to use the fact.\u00a0 Here is the work for this limit....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...This limit looks nothing like the limit in the fact,   however it can be thought of as a combination of the previous two parts by   doing a little rewriting.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ll   split the fraction up as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, the fact   wants a ... in the denominator of the   first and in the numerator of the second.\u00a0   This is easy enough to do if we multiply the whole thing by ...\u00a0(which is just one after all and so won\u2019t   change the problem) and then do a little rearranging as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...At this point   we can see that this really is two limits that we\u2019ve seen before.\u00a0 Here is the work for each of these and   notice on the second limit that we\u2019re going to work it a little differently   than we did in the previous part.\u00a0 This   time we\u2019re going to notice that it doesn\u2019t really matter whether the sine is   in the numerator or the denominator as long as the argument of the sine is   the same as what\u2019s in the numerator the limit is still one....\u00a0...Here is the   work for this limit....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...This limit almost looks the same as that in the fact in   the sense that the argument of the sine is the same as what is in the   denominator.\u00a0 However, notice that, in   the limit, ... is going to 4 and not   0 as the fact requires.\u00a0 However, with   a change of variables we can see that this limit is in fact set to use the   fact above regardless....\u00a0...So, let ...\u00a0and then notice that as ...\u00a0we have ....\u00a0 Therefore, after doing the change of   variable the limit becomes,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...The previous parts of this example all used the sine   portion of the fact.\u00a0 However, we could   just have easily used the cosine portion so here is a quick example using the   cosine portion to illustrate this.\u00a0   We\u2019ll not put in much explanation here as this really does work in the   same manner as the sine portion....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...All that is   required to use the fact is that the argument of the cosine is the same as   the denominator....\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve gotten this set of limit examples out of the way let\u2019s get back to the main point of this section, differentiating trig functions....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start with finding the derivative of the sine function.\u00a0 To do this we will need to use the definition of the derivative.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had to use this, but sometimes there just isn\u2019t anything we can do about it.\u00a0 Here is the definition of the derivative for the sine function....\u00a0...\u00a0...Since we can\u2019t just\u00a0 plug in ...to evaluate the limit we will need to use the following trig formula on the first sine in the numerator.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Doing this gives us,...\u00a0...As you can see upon using the trig formula we can combine the first and third term and then factor a sine out of that.\u00a0 We can then break up the fraction into two pieces, both of which can be dealt with separately....\u00a0...Now, both of the limits here are limits as ... approaches zero.\u00a0 In the first limit we have a sin... and in the second limit we have a cos....\u00a0 Both of these are only functions of ... only and as ... moves in towards zero this has no affect on the value of ....\u00a0 Therefore, as far as the limits are concerned, these two functions are constants and can be factored out of their respective limits.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...At this point all we need to do is use the limits in the fact above to finish out this problem....\u00a0...Differentiating cosine is done in a similar fashion.\u00a0 It will require a different trig formula, but other than that is an almost identical proof.\u00a0 The details will be left to you.\u00a0 When done with the proof you should get,...\u00a0...With these two out of the way the remaining four are fairly simple to get.\u00a0 All the remaining four trig functions can be defined in terms of sine and cosine and these definitions, along with appropriate derivative rules, can be used to get their derivatives....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at tangent.\u00a0 Tangent is defined as,...\u00a0...Now that we have the derivatives of sine and cosine all that we need to do is use the quotient rule on this.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, recall that ...\u00a0and if we also recall the definition of secant in terms of cosine we arrive at,...\u00a0...The remaining three trig functions are also quotients involving sine and/or cosine and so can be differentiated in a similar manner.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave the details to you.\u00a0 Here are the derivatives of all six of the trig functions....\u00a0...\u00a0...At this point we should work some examples....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...There really isn\u2019t a whole lot to this problem.\u00a0 We\u2019ll just differentiate each term using   the formulas from above.... ...In this part we will need to use the product rule on the   second term and note that we really will need the product rule here.\u00a0 There is no other way to do this derivative   unlike what we saw when we first looked at the product rule.\u00a0 When we first looked at the product rule   the only functions we knew how to differentiate were polynomials and in those   cases all we really needed to do was multiply them out and we could take the   derivative without the product rule.\u00a0   We are now getting into the point where we will be forced to do the   product rule at times regardless of whether or not we want to....\u00a0...We will also need to be careful with the minus sign in   front of the second term and make sure that it gets dealt with properly.\u00a0 There are two ways to deal with this.\u00a0 One way it to make sure that you use a set   of parenthesis as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Because the   second term is being subtracted off of the first term then the whole   derivative of the second term must also be subtracted off of the derivative   of the first term.\u00a0 The parenthesis   make this idea clear....\u00a0...A potentially easier way to do this is to think of the   minus sign as part of the first function in the product.\u00a0 Or, in other words the two functions in the   product, using this idea, are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...So, regardless of how you approach this problem you will   get the same derivative....\u00a0... ...As with the previous part we\u2019ll need to use the product   rule on the first term.\u00a0 We will also   think of the 5 as part of the first function in the product to make sure we   deal with it correctly.\u00a0 Alternatively,   you could make use of a set of parenthesis to make sure the 5 gets dealt with   properly.\u00a0 Either way will work, but   we\u2019ll stick with thinking of the 5 as part of the first term in the   product.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the derivative of this   function....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...In this part we\u2019ll need to use the quotient rule to take   the derivative....Be careful with the signs when differentiating the   denominator.\u00a0 The negative sign we get   from differentiating the cosine will cancel against the negative sign that is   already there....\u00a0...This appears to be done, but there is actually a fair   amount of simplification that can yet be done.\u00a0 To do this we need to factor out a \u201c-2\u201d   from the last two terms in the numerator and the make use of the fact that .......\u00a0...As a final problem here let\u2019s not forget that we still have our standard interpretations to derivatives....\u00a0...Suppose   that the amount of money in a bank account is given by ...where ... is in   years.\u00a0 During the first 10 years in   which the account is open when is the amount of money in the account   increasing?...\u00a0...To determine when the amount of money is increasing we   need to determine when the rate of change is positive.\u00a0 Since we know that the rate of change is   given by the derivative that is the first thing that we need to find....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, we need to determine where in the first 10 years this   will be positive.\u00a0 This is equivalent   to asking where in the interval [0, 10] is the derivative positive.\u00a0 Recall that both sine and cosine are   continuous functions and so the derivative is also a continuous   function.\u00a0 The ... then tells us that   the derivative can only change sign if it first goes through zero.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we need to solve the following equation....\u00a0...The solution to this equation is,...\u00a0...If you don\u2019t recall how to solve trig equations go back   and take a look at the sections on ... in the Review chapter....\u00a0...We are only interested in those solutions that fall in the   range [0, 10].\u00a0 Plugging in values of ... into the solutions above we see that   the values we need are,...\u00a0...So, much like solving polynomial inequalities all that we   need to do is sketch in a number line and add in these points.\u00a0 These points will divide the number line   into regions in which the derivative must always be the same sign.\u00a0 All that we need to do then is choose a   test point from each region to determine the sign of the derivative in that   region....\u00a0...Here is the number line with all the information on it....\u00a0...So, it looks like the amount of money in the bank account   will be increasing during the following intervals....\u00a0...Note that we can\u2019t say anything about what is happening   after ...\u00a0since we haven\u2019t done any work for ...\u2019s after that point....\u00a0...In this section we saw how to differentiate trig functions.\u00a0 We also saw in the last example that our interpretations of the derivative are still valid so we can\u2019t forget those....\u00a0...Also, it is important that we be able to solve trig equations as this is something that will arise off and on in this course.\u00a0 It is also important that we can do the kinds of number lines that we used in the last example to determine where a function is positive and where a function is negative.\u00a0 This is something that we will be doing on occasion in both this chapter and the next.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DiffTrigFcns.aspx", "media": "text",

following,...\u00a0...None of our rules will work on these functions and yet some of these functions are closer to the derivatives that we\u2019re liable to run into than the functions in the first

are....\u00a0...Suppose that we have two functions ... and ... and they   are both differentiable....\u00a0...Each of these forms have their uses, however we will work mostly with the first form in this class.\u00a0 To see the proof of the Chain Rule see the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s go back and use the Chain Rule on the function that we used when we opened this section....\u00a0...Use   the Chain Rule to differentiate .......We\u2019ve already identified the two functions that we needed   for the composition, but let\u2019s write them back down anyway and take their   derivatives....\u00a0...So, using the chain rule we get,...\u00a0...And this is what we got using the definition of the   derivative....\u00a0...In general we don\u2019t really do all the composition stuff in using the Chain Rule.\u00a0 That can get a little complicated and in fact obscures the fact that there is a quick and easy way of remembering the chain rule that doesn\u2019t require us to think in terms of function composition.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take the function from the previous example and rewrite it slightly....\u00a0...This function has an \u201cinside function\u201d and an \u201coutside function\u201d.\u00a0 The outside function is the square root or the exponent of ...\u00a0depending on how you want to think of it and the inside function is the stuff that we\u2019re taking the square root of or raising to the ..., again depending on how you want to look at it....\u00a0...The derivative is then,...\u00a0...In general this is how we think of the chain rule.\u00a0 We identify the \u201cinside function\u201d and the \u201coutside function\u201d.\u00a0 We then differentiate the outside function leaving the inside function alone and multiply all of this by the derivative of the inside function.\u00a0 In its general form this is,...\u00a0...We can always identify the \u201coutside function\u201d in the examples below by asking ourselves how we would evaluate the function.\u00a0 For instance in the ... case if we were to ask ourselves what ... is we would first evaluate the stuff under the radical and then finally take the square root of this result.\u00a0 The square root is the last operation that we perform in the evaluation and this is also the outside function.\u00a0 The outside function will always be the last operation you would perform if you were going to evaluate the function....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples of the Chain Rule....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...It looks like the outside function is the sine and the   inside function is 3....\u00a0 The derivative is then....\u00a0...Or with a little rewriting,...\u00a0... ...In this case the outside function is the exponent of 50   and the inside function is all the stuff on the inside of the   parenthesis.\u00a0 The derivative is then....\u00a0... ...Identifying the outside function in the previous two was   fairly simple since it really was the \u201coutside\u201d function in some sense.\u00a0 In this case we need to be a little   careful.\u00a0 Recall that the outside function   is the last operation that we would perform in an evaluation.\u00a0 In this case if we were to evaluate this   function the last operation would be the exponential.\u00a0 Therefore the outside function is the   exponential function and the inside function is its exponent....\u00a0...Here\u2019s the derivative....\u00a0...Remember, we leave the inside function alone when we   differentiate the outside function.\u00a0   So, the derivative of the exponential function (with the inside left   alone) is just the original function....\u00a0... ...Here the outside function is the natural logarithm and the   inside function is stuff on the inside of the logarithm....\u00a0...Again remember to leave the inside function along when   differentiating the outside function.\u00a0   So, upon differentiating the logarithm we end up not with 1/... but instead with 1/(inside   function)....\u00a0... ...In this case the outside function is the secant and the   inside is the .......\u00a0...In this case the derivative of the outside function is ....\u00a0 However, since we leave the inside function   alone we don\u2019t get ...\u2019s in   both.\u00a0 Instead we get ...\u00a0in both....\u00a0... ...There are two points to this problem.\u00a0 First, there are two terms and each will   require a different application of the chain rule.\u00a0 That will often be the case so don\u2019t expect   just a single chain rule when doing these problems.\u00a0 Second, we need to be very careful in   choosing the outside and inside function for each term....\u00a0...Recall that the first term can actually be written as,...\u00a0...So, in the first term the outside function is the exponent   of 4 and the inside function is the cosine.\u00a0   In the second term it\u2019s exactly the opposite.\u00a0 In the second term the outside function is   the cosine and the inside function is ....\u00a0 Here\u2019s the derivative for this function....\u00a0...There are a couple of general formulas that we can get for some special cases of the chain rule.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a quick look at those....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following....\u00a0... The outside   function is the exponent and the inside is .......\u00a0... The outside   function is the exponential function and the inside is .......\u00a0... The outside   function is the logarithm and the inside is .......\u00a0...The formulas in this example are really just special cases of the Chain Rule but may be useful to remember in order to quickly do some of these derivatives....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s also not forget the other rules that we\u2019ve got for doing derivatives.\u00a0 For the most part we\u2019ll not be explicitly identifying the inside and outside functions for the remainder of the problems in this section.\u00a0 We will be assuming that you can see our choices based on the previous examples and the work that we have shown....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0 ...This requires the product rule and each derivative in the   product rule will require a chain rule application as well....\u00a0...In this part be careful with the inverse tangent.\u00a0 We know that,...\u00a0...When doing the chain rule with this we remember that we\u2019ve   got to leave the inside function alone.\u00a0   That means that where we have the ...\u00a0in the derivative of ...\u00a0we will need to have ....... ...In this case we will be using the chain rule in concert   with the quotient rule....\u00a0...These tend to be a little messy.\u00a0 Notice that when we go to simplify that   we\u2019ll be able to a fair amount of factoring in the numerator and this will   often greatly simplify the derivative....\u00a0...After factoring we were able to cancel some of the terms   in the numerator against the denominator.\u00a0   So even though the initial chain rule was fairly messy the final   answer is significantly simpler because of the factoring....\u00a0...The point of this last example is to not forget the other derivative rules that we\u2019ve got.\u00a0 Most of the examples in this section won\u2019t involve the product rule or the quotient rule to make the problems a little shorter.\u00a0 However, in practice they will often be in the same problem....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at some more complicated examples....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...We\u2019re going to be a little more careful in these problems   than we were in the previous ones.\u00a0 The   reason will be quickly apparent....\u00a0... ...In this case let\u2019s first rewrite the function in a form   that will be a little easier to deal with....Now, let\u2019s start the derivative....\u00a0...Notice that we didn\u2019t actually do the derivative of the   inside function yet.\u00a0 This is to allow   us to notice that when we do differentiate the second term we will require   the chain rule again.\u00a0 Notice as well   that we will only need the chain rule on the exponential and not the first   term.\u00a0 In many functions we will be   using the chain rule more than once so don\u2019t get excited about this when it   happens.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s go ahead and finish this example out....\u00a0...Be careful with the second application of the chain   rule.\u00a0 Only the exponential gets   multiplied by the \u201c-9\u201d since that\u2019s the derivative of the inside function for   that term only.\u00a0 One of the more common   mistakes in these kinds of problems is to multiply the whole thing by the   \u201c-9\u201d and not just the second term....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll not put as many words into this example, but we\u2019re   still going to be careful with this derivative so make sure you can follow   each of the steps here....\u00a0...As with the first example the second term of the inside   function required the chain rule to differentiate it.\u00a0 Also note that again we need to be careful   when multiplying by the derivative of the inside function when doing the   chain rule on the second term....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s jump right into this one....\u00a0...In this example both of the terms in the inside function   required a separate application of the chain rule....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll need to be a little careful with this one....\u00a0...This problem required a total of 4 chain rules to   complete. ...\u00a0...Sometimes these can get quite unpleasant and require many applications of the chain rule.\u00a0 Initially, in these cases it\u2019s usually best to be careful as we did in this previous set of examples and write out a couple of extra steps rather than trying to do it all in one step in your head.\u00a0 Once you get better at the chain rule you\u2019ll find that you can do these fairly quickly in your head....\u00a0...Finally, before we move onto the next section there is one more issue that we need to address.\u00a0 In the ... section we claimed that,...\u00a0but at the time we didn\u2019t have the knowledge to\u00a0 do this.\u00a0 We now do.\u00a0 What we needed was the Chain Rule....\u00a0...First, notice that using a property of logarithms we can write ... as,...\u00a0...This may seem kind of silly, but it is needed to compute the derivative.\u00a0 Now, using this we can write the function as,...\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve gotten that taken care of all we need to remember is that ... is a constant and so ...\u00a0is also a constant.\u00a0 Now, differentiating the final version of this function is a (hopefully) fairly simple Chain Rule problem....\u00a0...Now, all we need to do is rewrite the first term back as ...\u00a0to get,...\u00a0...So, not too bad if you can see the trick to rewrite ... and with the Chain Rule.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ChainRule.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Chain

Now recall that ....\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to do any basic arithmetic   that needs to be done such as any multiplication and/or division in the   coefficients....\u00a0... ...The point of this problem is to make sure that you deal   with negative exponents correctly.\u00a0   Here is the derivative....\u00a0...Make sure that you correctly deal with the exponents in   these cases, especially the negative exponents.\u00a0 It is an easy mistake to \u201cgo the other way\u201d   when subtracting one off from a negative exponent and get ...\u00a0instead of the correct ....   ...\u00a0... ...Now in this function the second term is not correctly set   up for us to use the power rule.\u00a0 The   power rule requires that the term be a variable to a power only and the term   must be in the numerator.\u00a0 So, prior to   differentiating we first need to rewrite the second term into a form that we   can deal with....Note that we left the 3 in the denominator and only moved the   variable up to the numerator.\u00a0 Remember   that the only thing that gets an exponent is the term that is immediately to   the left of the exponent.\u00a0 If we\u2019d   wanted the three to come up as well we\u2019d have written,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...so be careful   with this!\u00a0 It\u2019s a very common mistake   to bring the 3 up into the numerator as well at this stage....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve gotten the function rewritten into a proper   form that allows us to use the Power Rule we can differentiate the   function.\u00a0 Here is the derivative for   this part.... ...All of the terms in this function have roots in them.\u00a0 In order to use the power rule we need to   first convert all the roots to fractional exponents.\u00a0 Again, remember that the Power Rule   requires us to have a variable to a number and that it must be in the   numerator of the term.\u00a0 Here is the   function written in \u201cproper\u201d form....\u00a0...In the last two terms we combined the exponents.\u00a0 You should always do this with this kind of   term.\u00a0 In a later section we will learn   of a technique that would allow us to differentiate this term without combining   exponents, however it will take significantly more work to do.\u00a0 Also don\u2019t forget to move the term in the   denominator of the third term up to the numerator.\u00a0 We can now differentiate the function....\u00a0...Make sure that you can deal with fractional   exponents.\u00a0 You will see a lot of them   in this class....\u00a0... ...In all of the previous examples the exponents have been   nice integers or fractions.\u00a0 That is   usually what we\u2019ll see in this class.\u00a0   However, the exponent only needs to be a number so don\u2019t get excited   about problems like this one.\u00a0 They   work exactly the same....\u00a0...The answer is a little messy and we won\u2019t reduce the   exponents down to decimals.\u00a0 However,   this problem is not terribly difficult it just looks that way initially....\u00a0...There is a general rule about derivatives in this class that you will need to get into the habit of using.\u00a0 When you see radicals you should always first convert the radical to a fractional exponent and then simplify exponents as much as possible.\u00a0 Following this rule will save you a lot of grief in the future....\u00a0...Back when we first put down the properties we noted that we hadn\u2019t included a property for products and quotients.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t differentiate any product or quotient at this point.\u00a0 There are some that we can do....\u00a0...Differentiate   each of the following functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0 ...In this function we can\u2019t just differentiate the first   term, differentiate the second term and then multiply the two back   together.\u00a0 That just won\u2019t work.\u00a0 We will discuss this in detail in the next   section so if you\u2019re not sure you believe that hold on for a bit and we\u2019ll be   looking at that soon as well as showing you an example of why it won\u2019t work....\u00a0...It is still possible to do this derivative however.\u00a0 All that we need to do is convert the   radical to fractional exponents (as we should anyway) and then multiply this   through the parenthesis....\u00a0...Now we can differentiate the function....\u00a0... ...As with the first part we can\u2019t just differentiate the   numerator and the denominator and the put it back together as a   fraction.\u00a0 Again, if you\u2019re not sure   you believe this hold on until the next section and we\u2019ll take a more   detailed look at this....\u00a0...We can simplify this rational expression however as   follows....This is a function that we can differentiate....\u00a0...So, as we saw in this example there are a few products and quotients that we can differentiate.\u00a0 If we can first do some simplification the functions will sometimes simplify into a form that can be differentiated using the properties and formulas in this section....\u00a0...Before moving on to the next section let\u2019s work a couple of examples to remind us once again of some of the interpretations of the derivative....\u00a0...Is   ...\u00a0increasing, decreasing or not changing at ...?...We know that the rate of change of a function is given by   the functions derivative so all we need to do is it rewrite the function (to   deal with the second term) and then take the derivative....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we   rewrote the last term in the derivative back as a fraction.\u00a0 This is not something we\u2019ve done to this   point and is only being done here to help with the evaluation in the next   step.\u00a0 It\u2019s often easier to do the   evaluation with positive exponents.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, upon   evaluating the derivative we get ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, at ...\u00a0the derivative is negative and so the   function is decreasing at .......\u00a0...Find   the equation of the tangent line to ...\u00a0at .......\u00a0...We know that the equation of a tangent line is given by,...\u00a0...So, we will need the derivative of the function (don\u2019t   forget to get rid of the radical)....Again, notice that we eliminated the negative exponent in   the derivative solely for the sake of the evaluation.\u00a0 All we need to do then is evaluate the   function and the derivative at the point in question, .......The tangent line is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The   position of an object at any time ...

(...   ...) ...then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...What this fact is really saying is that when we go to take a limit at infinity for a polynomial then all we need to really do is look at the term with the largest power and ask what that term is doing in the limit since the polynomial will have the same behavior.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...You can see the proof in the ... section in the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now move into some more complicated limits....\u00a0...Evaluate   both of the following limits....First, the only difference between these two is that one   is going to positive infinity and the other is going to negative   infinity.\u00a0 Sometimes this small difference   will affect then value of the limit and at other times it won\u2019t....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the first limit and as with our first set   of examples it might be tempting to just \u201cplug\u201d in the infinity.\u00a0 Since both the numerator and denominator   are polynomials we can use the above fact to determine the behavior of   each.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...This is yet another indeterminate...form.\u00a0 In this case we   might be tempted to say that the limit is infinity (because of the infinity   in the numerator), zero (because of the infinity in the denominator) or -1   (because something divided by itself is one).\u00a0   There are three separate arithmetic \u201crules\u201d at work here and without   work there is no way to know which \u201crule\u201d will be correct and to make matters   worse it\u2019s possible that none of them may work and we might get a completely   different answer, say ...\u00a0to pick a number completely at random....\u00a0...So, when we have a polynomial divided by a polynomial   we\u2019re going to proceed much as we did with only polynomials.\u00a0 We first identify the largest power of ... in the denominator (and yes, we only   look at the denominator for this) and we then factor this out of both the   numerator and denominator.\u00a0 Doing this   for the first limit gives,...\u00a0...Once we\u2019ve done this we can cancel the ...\u00a0from both the numerator and the denominator   and then use the Fact 1 above to take the limit of all the remaining   terms.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...In this case the indeterminate form was neither of the   \u201cobvious\u201d choices of infinity, zero, or -1 so be careful with make these   kinds of assumptions with this kind of indeterminate forms....\u00a0...The second limit is done in a similar fashion.\u00a0 Notice however, that nowhere in the work   for the first limit did we actually use the fact that the limit was going to   plus infinity.\u00a0 In this case it doesn\u2019t   matter which infinity we are going towards we will get the same value for the   limit....\u00a0...In the previous example the infinity that we were using in the limit didn\u2019t change the answer.\u00a0 This will not always be the case so don\u2019t make the assumption that this will always be the case....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example where we get different answers for each limit....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....The square root in this problem won\u2019t change our work, but   it will make the work a little messier....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the first limit.\u00a0 In this case the largest power of ... in the denominator is just an ....\u00a0   So we need to factor an ...   out of the numerator and the denominator.\u00a0   When we are done factoring the ...   out we will need an ... in both of   the numerator and the denominator.\u00a0 To   get this in the numerator we will have to factor an ... out of the square root so that after we take the   square root we will get an .......\u00a0...This is probably not something you\u2019re used to doing, but   just remember that when it comes out of the square root it needs to be an ... and the only way have an ... come out of a square is to take the   square root of ... and so   that is what we\u2019ll need to factor out of the term under the radical.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the factoring work for this part,...\u00a0...This is where we need to be really careful with the square   root in the problem.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget that...\u00a0...Square roots are ALWAYS positive and so we need the   absolute value bars on the ... to   make sure that it will give a positive answer.\u00a0 This is not something that most people   ever remember seeing in an Algebra class and in fact it\u2019s not always given   in an Algebra class.\u00a0 However, at this   point it becomes absolutely vital that we know and use this fact.\u00a0 Using this fact the limit becomes,...\u00a0...Now, we can\u2019t just cancel the ...\u2019s.\u00a0 We first will need to   get rid of the absolute value bars.\u00a0 To   do this let\u2019s recall the definition of absolute value....\u00a0...In this case we are going out to plus infinity so we can   safely assume that the ... will be   positive and so we can just drop the absolute value bars.\u00a0 The limit is then,...Let\u2019s now take a look at the second limit (the one with   negative infinity).\u00a0 In this case we   will need to pay attention to the limit that we are using.\u00a0 The initial work will be the same up until   we reach the following step....\u00a0...In this limit we are going to minus infinity so in this   case we can assume that ... is   negative.\u00a0 So, in order to drop the   absolute value bars in this case we will need to tack on a minus sign as   well.\u00a0 The limit is then,...\u00a0...So, as we saw in the last two examples sometimes the infinity in the limit will affect the answer and other times it won\u2019t.\u00a0 Note as well that it doesn\u2019t always just change the sign of the number.\u00a0 It can on occasion completely change the value.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see an example of this later in this section....\u00a0...Before moving on to a couple of more examples let\u2019s revisit the idea of asymptotes that we first saw in the previous section.\u00a0 Just as we can have vertical asymptotes defined in terms of limits we can also have horizontal asymptotes defined in terms of limits....\u00a0...The function ...   will have a horizontal asymptote at ...   if either of the following are true....\u00a0...We\u2019re not going to be doing much with asymptotes here, but it\u2019s an easy fact to give and we can use the previous example to illustrate all the asymptote ideas we\u2019ve seen in the both this section and the previous section.\u00a0 The function in the last example will have two horizontal asymptotes.\u00a0 It will also have a vertical asymptote.\u00a0 Here is a graph of the function showing these....Let\u2019s work another couple of examples involving rational expressions....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....Let\u2019s do the first limit and in this case it looks like we   will factor a ... out of   both the numerator and denominator.\u00a0   Remember that we only look at the denominator when determining the   largest power of ... here.\u00a0 There is a larger power of ... in the numerator but we ignore   it.\u00a0 We ONLY look at the denominator   when doing this!\u00a0 So doing the   factoring gives,...\u00a0...When we take the limit we\u2019ll need to be a little   careful.\u00a0 The first term in the   numerator and denominator will both be zero.\u00a0   However, the ...   in the numerator will be going to plus infinity in the limit and so the limit   is,...\u00a0...The final limit is negative because we have a quotient of   positive quantity and a negative quantity.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at the second limit.\u00a0 Note that the only different in the work is   at the final \u201cevaluation\u201d step and so we\u2019ll pick up the work there....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case   the ... in the numerator   gives negative infinity in the limit since we are going out to minus infinity   and the power is odd.\u00a0 The answer is   positive since we have a quotient of two negative numbers....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....In this case it looks like we will factor a ...\u00a0out of both the numerator and   denominator.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...In this case using Fact 1 we can see that the numerator is   zero and so since the denominator is also not zero the fraction, and hence   the limit, will be zero....\u00a0...In this section we concentrated on limits at infinity with functions that only involved polynomials and/or rational expression involving polynomials.\u00a0 There are many more types of functions that we could use here.\u00a0 That is the subject of the next section....\u00a0...To see a precise and mathematical definition of this kind of limit see the ... section at the end of this chapter.", "url":

can\u2019t just plug in ....\u00a0 So we will need to simplify things a   little.\u00a0 In this case we will need to   combine the two terms in the numerator into a single rational expression as   follows....\u00a0...Before finishing this let\u2019s note a couple of things.\u00a0 First, we didn\u2019t multiply out the   denominator.\u00a0 Multiplying out the   denominator will just overly complicate things so let\u2019s keep it simple.\u00a0 Next, as with the first example, after the   simplification we only have terms with ...\u2019s   in them left in the numerator and so we can now cancel an ... out....\u00a0...So, upon canceling the ...   we can evaluate the limit and get the derivative. ...\u00a0...The derivative is then,...\u00a0...Find   the derivative of the following function using the definition of the derivative....First plug into the definition of the derivative as we\u2019ve   done with the previous two examples....\u00a0...In this problem we\u2019re going to have to rationalize the   numerator.\u00a0 You do remember ... from an   Algebra class right?\u00a0 In an Algebra   class you probably only rationalized the denominator, but you can also   rationalize numerators.\u00a0\u00a0 Remember that   in rationalizing the numerator (in this case) we multiply both the numerator   and denominator by the numerator except we change the sign between the two   terms.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the rationalizing work   for this problem,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, after the simplification we have only ...\u2019s left in the numerator.\u00a0 So, cancel the ... and evaluate the limit....\u00a0...And so we get a derivative of,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one more example.\u00a0 This one will be a little different, but it\u2019s got a point that needs to be made....\u00a0...Determine   ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0...Since this problem is asking for the derivative at a   specific point we\u2019ll go ahead and use that in our work.\u00a0 It will make our life easier and that\u2019s   always a good thing....\u00a0...So, plug into the definition and simplify....\u00a0...We saw a situation like this back when we were looking at ....\u00a0 As in that section we can\u2019t just cancel the   ...\u2019s.\u00a0 We will have to look at the two one sided   limits and recall that ...\u00a0...\u00a0...The two one-sided limits are different and so...doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0   However, this is the limit that gives us the derivative that we\u2019re   after....\u00a0...If the limit doesn\u2019t exist then the derivative doesn\u2019t   exist either....\u00a0...In this example we have finally seen a function for which the derivative doesn\u2019t exist at a point.\u00a0 This is a fact of life that we\u2019ve got to be aware of.\u00a0 Derivatives will not always exist.\u00a0 Note as well that this doesn\u2019t say anything about whether or not the derivative exists anywhere else.\u00a0 In fact, the derivative of the absolute value function exists at every point except the one we just looked at, .......\u00a0...The preceding discussion leads to the following definition....\u00a0...A function ...\u00a0is called ... at ...\u00a0if ... ...\u00a0exists and ...\u00a0is called differentiable on an interval if   the derivative exists for each point in that interval....\u00a0...The next theorem shows us a very nice relationship between functions that are continuous and those that are differentiable. ...\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is differentiable at ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0is continuous at .......\u00a0...See the ... section of the Extras chapter to see the proof of this theorem.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that this theorem does not work in reverse.\u00a0 Consider ...\u00a0and take a look at,...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is continuous at ...\u00a0but we\u2019ve just shown above in Example 4 that\u00a0 ...\u00a0is not differentiable at .......\u00a0...\u00a0Next we need to discuss some alternate notation for the derivative.\u00a0 The typical derivative notation is the \u201cprime\u201d notation.\u00a0 However, there is another notation that is used on occasion so let\u2019s cover that....\u00a0...Given a function ...\u00a0all of the following are equivalent and represent the derivative of ...\u00a0with respect to .......\u00a0...Because we also need to evaluate derivatives on occasion we also need a notation for evaluating derivatives when using the fractional notation.\u00a0 So if we want to evaluate the derivative at ... all of the following are equivalent....\u00a0...Note as well that on occasion we will drop the ... part on the function to simplify the notation somewhat.\u00a0 In these cases the following are equivalent....\u00a0...As a final note in this section we\u2019ll acknowledge that computing most derivatives directly from the definition is a fairly complex (and sometimes painful) process filled with opportunities to make mistakes.\u00a0 In a couple of sections we\u2019ll start developing formulas and/or properties that will help us to take the derivative of many of the common functions so we won\u2019t need to resort to the definition of the derivative too often....\u00a0...This does not mean however that it isn\u2019t important to know the definition of the derivative!\u00a0 It is an important definition that we should always know and keep in the back of our minds.\u00a0 It is just something that we\u2019re not going to be working with all that much.

evaluating the function at the point in question.\u00a0 It\u2019s now time to formally define what we mean by \u201cnice enough\u201d....\u00a0...A function ...\u00a0is said to be ... at ...\u00a0if ...A function is said to be continuous on the interval [...] if it is continuous at each   point in the interval....\u00a0...This definition can be turned around into the following fact....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is continuous at ...then,...\u00a0...This is exactly the same fact that we first put down ... when we started looking at limits with the exception that we have replaced the phrase \u201cnice enough\u201d with continuous.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It\u2019s nice to finally know what we mean by \u201cnice enough\u201d, however, the definition doesn\u2019t really tell us just what it means for a function to be continuous.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at an example to help us understand just what it means for a function to be continuous....\u00a0...Given   the graph of ..., shown below,   determine if ... is continuous at ... and .......To answer the question for each point we\u2019ll need to get   both the limit at that point and the function value at that point.\u00a0 If they are equal the function is continuous   at that point and if they aren\u2019t equal the function isn\u2019t continuous at that   point....\u00a0...First ...The function value and the limit aren\u2019t the same and so   the function is not continuous at this point.\u00a0   This kind of discontinuity in a graph is called a ....\u00a0 Jump   discontinuities occur where the graph has a break in it as this graph does....\u00a0...Now .......The function is continuous at this point since the   function and limit have the same value....\u00a0...Finally .......The function is not continuous at this point.\u00a0 This kind of discontinuity is called a ....\u00a0 Removable discontinuities are those where   there is a hole in the graph as there is in this case....\u00a0...From this example we can get a quick \u201cworking\u201d definition of continuity.\u00a0 A function is continuous on an interval if we can draw the graph from start to finish without ever once picking up our pencil.\u00a0 The graph in the last example has only two discontinuities since there are only two places where we would have to pick up our pencil in sketching it.\u00a0 ...In other words, a function is continuous if its graph has no holes or breaks in it....\u00a0...For many functions it\u2019s easy to determine where it won\u2019t be continuous.\u00a0 Functions won\u2019t be continuous where we have things like division by zero or logarithms of zero.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example of determining where a function is not continuous....\u00a0...Determine   where the function below is not continuous....Rational functions are continuous everywhere except where   we have division by zero.\u00a0 So all that   we need to is determine where the denominator is zero.\u00a0 That\u2019s easy enough to determine by setting   the denominator equal to zero and solving....\u00a0...So, the function will not be continuous at ... and .......\u00a0...A nice consequence of continuity is the following fact....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is continuous at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0then,...\u00a0...To see a proof of this fact see the ... section in the Extras chapter.\u00a0 With this fact we can now do limits like the following example....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....Since we know that exponentials are continuous everywhere   we can use the fact above....\u00a0...Another very nice consequence of continuity is the Intermediate Value Theorem....\u00a0...Suppose that ...   is continuous on [...] and let ... be any number between ... and ....\u00a0\u00a0 Then there exists a   number ... such that,...\u00a0...All the Intermediate Value Theorem is really saying is that a continuous function will take on all values between ... and ....\u00a0 Below is a graph of a continuous function that illustrates the Intermediate Value Theorem....As we can see from this image if we pick any value, ..., that is between the value of ... and the value of ... and draw a line straight out from this point the line will hit the graph in at least one point.\u00a0 In other words somewhere between ... and ... the function will take on the value of ....\u00a0 Also, as the figure shows the function may take on the value at more than one place....\u00a0...It\u2019s also important to note that the Intermediate Value Theorem only says that the function will take on the value of ... somewhere between ... and ....\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t say just what that value will be.\u00a0 It only says that it exists.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that a function will take the value of ... somewhere between ... and ... but it doesn\u2019t tell us where it will take the value nor does it tell us how many times it will take the value.\u00a0 There are important idea to remember about the Intermediate Value Theorem....\u00a0...A nice use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is to prove the existence of roots of equations as the following example shows....\u00a0...Show   that ...\u00a0has a root somewhere in the interval ...[-1,2]....\u00a0...What we\u2019re really asking here is whether or not the   function will take on the value...somewhere between -1 and 2.\u00a0 In other words, we want to show that there   is a number ... such that ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 However if we define ...\u00a0and acknowledge that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we can see that these two condition on ... are exactly the conclusions of the   Intermediate Value Theorem....\u00a0...So, this problem is set up to use the Intermediate Value   Theorem and in fact, all we need to do is to show that the function is   continuous and that ...\u00a0is between ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0(...   ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0and we\u2019ll be done....\u00a0...To do this all we need to do is compute,...\u00a0...So we have,...\u00a0...Therefore ...\u00a0is between ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and since ...\u00a0is a polynomial it\u2019s continuous everywhere   and so in particular it\u2019s continuous on the interval [-1,2].\u00a0 So by the Intermediate Value Theorem there   must be a number ...\u00a0so that, ...\u00a0...Therefore the polynomial does have a root between -1 and   2.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...For the sake of completeness here is a graph showing the   root that we just proved existed.\u00a0 Note   that we used a computer program to actually find the root and that the   Intermediate Value Theorem did not tell us what this value was....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example of the Intermediate Value Theorem....\u00a0...If   possible, determine if ...\u00a0takes the following values in the interval   [0,5]....Does   ...?\u00a0\u00a0 ...Does   ...?\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, so much as the previous example we\u2019re being asked to   determine, if possible, if the function takes on either of the two values   above in the interval [0,5].\u00a0 First,   let\u2019s notice that this is a continuous function and so we know that we can   use the Intermediate Value Theorem to do this problem....\u00a0...Now, for each part we will let ... be the given value for that part and then we\u2019ll need to show   that ... lives between ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 If it does then we can use the Intermediate   Value Theorem to prove that the function will take the given value....\u00a0...So, since we\u2019ll need the two function evaluations for each   part let\u2019s give them here,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Now, let\u2019s take   a look at each part....\u00a0... Okay, in this case we\u2019ll define ...\u00a0and we can see that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, by the   Intermediate Value Theorem there must be a number ...\u00a0such that...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Before moving on to the section where we learn how to compute derivatives by avoiding the limits we were evaluating in the previous section we need to take a quick look at some of the interpretations of the derivative.\u00a0 All of these interpretations arise from recalling how our definition of the derivative came about.\u00a0 The definition came about by noticing that all the problems that we worked in the first ... in the chapter on limits required us to evaluate the same limit....\u00a0...The first interpretation of a derivative is rate of change.\u00a0 This was not the first problem that we looked at in the limit chapter, but it is the most important interpretation of the derivative.\u00a0 If ...\u00a0represents a quantity at any ... then the derivative ...\u00a0represents the instantaneous rate of change of ...\u00a0at .......\u00a0...Suppose   that the amount of water in a holding tank at ... minutes is given by ....\u00a0 Determine each of the following....Is   the volume of water in the tank increasing or decreasing at ...\u00a0minute?\u00a0\u00a0   ...Is   the volume of water in the tank increasing or decreasing at ...\u00a0minutes?\u00a0\u00a0   ...Is   the volume of water in the tank changing faster at ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0minutes?\u00a0\u00a0   ...Is   the volume of water in the tank ever not changing?\u00a0 If so, when?\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the solution to this example we will use both notations   for the derivative just to get you familiar with the different notations....\u00a0...We are going to need the rate of change of the volume to   answer these questions.\u00a0 This means   that we will need the derivative of this function since that will give us a   formula for the rate of change at any time ....\u00a0 Now, notice that the   function giving the volume of water in the tank is the same function that we   saw in Example 1 in the last ...   except the letters have changed.\u00a0 The   change in letters between the function in this example versus the function in   the example from the last section won\u2019t affect the work and so we can just   use the answer from that example with an appropriate change in letters....\u00a0...The derivative is....\u00a0...Recall from our work in the first limits section that we   determined that if the rate of change was positive then the quantity was   increasing and if the rate of change was negative then the quantity was   decreasing....\u00a0...We can now work the problem....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0...In this case all that we need is the rate of change of the   volume at ...or,...\u00a0...So, at ...\u00a0the rate of change is negative and so the   volume must be decreasing at this time....\u00a0... ...Again, we will need the rate of change at .......\u00a0...In this case the rate of change is positive and so the   volume must be increasing at ...\u00a0... ...To answer this question all that we look at is the size of   the rate of change and we don\u2019t worry about the sign of the rate of   change.\u00a0 All that we need to know here   is that the larger the number the faster the rate of change.\u00a0 So, in this case the volume is changing   faster at ...than   at ....... ...The volume will not be changing if it has a rate of change   of zero.\u00a0 In order to have a rate of   change of zero this means that the derivative must be zero.\u00a0 So, to answer this question we will then   need to solve...\u00a0...This is easy enough to do....\u00a0...So at ...\u00a0the volume isn\u2019t changing.\u00a0 Note that all this is saying is that for a   brief instant the volume isn\u2019t changing.\u00a0   It doesn\u2019t say that at this point the volume will quit changing   permanently. ...\u00a0...If we go back to our answers from parts (a) and (b) we can   get an idea about what is going on.\u00a0 At   ...\u00a0the volume is decreasing and at ...\u00a0the volume is increasing.\u00a0 So at some point in time the volume needs   to switch from decreasing to increasing.\u00a0   That time is .......\u00a0...This is the time in which the volume goes from decreasing   to increasing and so for the briefest instant in time the volume will quit   changing as it changes from decreasing to increasing....\u00a0...Note that one of the more common mistakes that students make in these kinds of problems is to try and determine increasing/decreasing from the function values rather than the derivatives.\u00a0 In this case if we took the function values at ..., ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we would get,...\u00a0...Clearly as we go from ...\u00a0to ...\u00a0the volume has decreased.\u00a0 This might lead us to decide that AT ...\u00a0the volume is decreasing.\u00a0 However, we just can\u2019t say that.\u00a0 All we can say is that between ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0the volume has decreased at some point in time.\u00a0 The only way to know what is happening right at ...\u00a0is to compute ...\u00a0and look at its sign to determine increasing/decreasing.\u00a0 In this case ...\u00a0is negative and so the volume really is decreasing at .......\u00a0...Now, if we\u2019d plugged into the function rather than the derivative we would have gotten the correct answer for ...\u00a0even though our reasoning would have been wrong.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to not let this give you the idea that this will always be the case.\u00a0 It just happened to work out in the case of\u00a0 .......\u00a0...To see that this won\u2019t always work let\u2019s now look at ....\u00a0 If we plug ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0into the volume we can see that again as we go from ...\u00a0to ...\u00a0the volume has decreased.\u00a0 Again, however all this says is that the volume HAS decreased somewhere between ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 It does NOT say that the volume is decreasing at ....\u00a0 The only way to know what is going on right at ...\u00a0is to compute ...\u00a0and in this case ...\u00a0is positive and so the volume is actually increasing at .......\u00a0...So, be careful.\u00a0 When asked to determine if a function is increasing or decreasing at a point make sure and look at the derivative.\u00a0 It is the only sure way to get the correct answer.\u00a0 We are not looking to determine is the function has increased/decreased by the time we reach a particular point.\u00a0 We are looking to determine if the function is increasing/decreasing at that point in  question....\u00a0...This is the next major interpretation of the derivative.\u00a0 The slope of the tangent line to ...\u00a0at ...\u00a0is .... The tangent line then is given by,...\u00a0...Find   the tangent line to the following function at .......We first need the derivative of the function and we found   that in Example 3 in the last ....\u00a0 The derivative is,...\u00a0...Now all that we need is the function value and derivative   (for the slope) at .......\u00a0...The tangent line is then,...\u00a0...Recall that this can be thought of as a special case of the rate of change interpretation.\u00a0 If the position of an object is given by ...\u00a0after ... units of time the velocity of the object at ...is given by .......\u00a0...Suppose   that the position of an object after ...   hours is given by,...Answer both of the following about this object....Is   the object moving to the right or the left at ...\u00a0hours?\u00a0\u00a0   ...Does   the object ever stop moving?\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Once again we need the derivative and we found that in   Example 2 in the last ....\u00a0 The derivative is,... ...\u00a0To determine if the   object is moving to the right (velocity is positive) or left (velocity is   negative) we need the derivative at .......\u00a0...So the velocity at ...\u00a0is positive and so the object is moving to   the right at .......\u00a0... ...The object will stop moving if the velocity is ever   zero.\u00a0 However, note that the only way   a rational expression will ever be zero is if the numerator is zero.\u00a0 Since the numerator of the derivative (and   hence the speed) is a constant it can\u2019t be zero....\u00a0...Therefore, the object will never stop moving. ...\u00a0...In fact, we can say a little more here.\u00a0 The object will always be moving to the   right since the velocity is always positive....\u00a0...We\u2019ve seen three major interpretations of the derivative here.\u00a0 You will need to remember these, especially the rate of change, as they will show up continually throughout this course....\u00a0...Before we leave this section let\u2019s work one more example that encompasses some of the ideas discussed here and is just a nice example to work....\u00a0...Below   is the sketch of a function ....\u00a0 Sketch the graph of the derivative of this   function, .......\u00a0...At first glance this seems to an all but impossible   task.\u00a0 However, if you have some basic   knowledge of the interpretations of the derivative you can get a sketch of   the derivative.\u00a0 It will not be a   perfect sketch for the most part, but you should be able to get most of the   basic features of the derivative in the sketch....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with the following sketch of the function   with a couple of additions....\u00a0...Notice that at ...,   ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0the tangent line to the function is   horizontal.\u00a0 This means that the slope   of the tangent line must be zero.\u00a0 Now,   we know that the slope of the tangent line at a particular point is also the   value of the derivative of the function at that point.\u00a0 Therefore, we now know that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is a good   starting point for us.\u00a0 It gives us a   few points on the graph of the derivative.\u00a0   It also breaks the domain of the function up into regions where the   function is increasing and decreasing.\u00a0   We know, from our discussions above, that if the function is   increasing at a point then the derivative must be positive at that   point.\u00a0 Likewise, we know that if the   function is decreasing at a point then the derivative must be negative at   that point....\u00a0...We can now give   the following information about the derivative....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Remember that   we are giving the signs of the derivatives here and these are solely a   function of whether the function is increasing or decreasing.\u00a0 The sign of the function itself is   completely immaterial here and will not in any way effect the sign of the derivative....\u00a0...This may still   seem like we don\u2019t have enough information to get a sketch, but we can get a   little bit more information about the derivative from the graph of the   function.\u00a0 In the range ...\u00a0we know that the derivative must be   negative, however we can also see that the derivative needs to be increasing   in this range.\u00a0 It is negative here   until we reach ...\u00a0and at this point the derivative must be   zero.\u00a0 The only way for the derivative   to be negative to the left of ...\u00a0and zero at ...\u00a0is for the derivative to increase as we   increase ... towards .......\u00a0...Now, in the   range ...\u00a0we know that the derivative must be zero at   the endpoints and positive in between the two endpoints.\u00a0 Directly to the right of ...\u00a0the derivative must also be increasing   (because it starts at zero and then goes positive ...\u00a0therefore it must be increasing).\u00a0 So, the derivative in this range must start   out increasing and must eventually get back to zero at ....\u00a0 So, at some point in this interval the   derivative must start decreasing before it reaches ....\u00a0 Now, we have to be careful here because   this is just general behavior here at the two endpoints.\u00a0 We won\u2019t know where the derivative goes   from increasing to decreasing and it may well change between increasing and decreasing   several times before we reach ....\u00a0 All we can really say is that immediately   to the right of ...\u00a0the derivative will be increasing and   immediately to the left of ...\u00a0the derivative will be decreasing....\u00a0...Next, for the ranges ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we know the derivative will be zero at the   endpoints and negative in between.\u00a0   Also, following the type of reasoning given above we can see in each   of these ranges that the derivative will be decreasing just to the right of   the left hand endpoint and increasing just to the left of the right hand   endpoint....\u00a0...Finally, in the last region ...\u00a0we know that the derivative is zero at ...\u00a0and positive to the right of ....\u00a0 Once again, following the reasoning above,   the derivative must also be increasing in this range....\u00a0...Putting all of this material together (and always taking   the simplest choices for increasing and/or decreasing information) gives us   the following sketch for the derivative....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that this was done with the actual derivative and so   is in fact accurate.\u00a0 Any sketch you do   will probably not look quite the same.\u00a0   The \u201chumps\u201d in each of the regions may be at different places and/or   different heights for example.\u00a0 Also,   note that we left off the vertical scale because given the information that   we\u2019ve got at this point there was no real way to know this information....\u00a0...That doesn\u2019t mean however that we can\u2019t get some ideas of   specific points on the derivative other than where we know the derivative to   be zero.\u00a0 To see this let\u2019s check out   the following graph of the function (not the derivative, but the function)....\u00a0...\u00a0...At ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we\u2019ve sketched in a couple of tangent   lines.\u00a0 We can use the basic rise/run   slope concept to estimate the value of the derivative at these points.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start at ....\u00a0 We\u2019ve got two points on the line here.\u00a0 We can see that each seem to be about   one-quarter of the way off the grid line.\u00a0   So, taking that into account and the fact that we go through one   complete grid we can see that the slope of the tangent line, and hence the   derivative, is approximately -1.5....\u00a0...At ...\u00a0it looks like (with some heavy estimation)   that the second point is about 6.5 grids above the first point and so the   slope of the tangent line here, and hence the derivative, is approximately   6.5.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is the sketch of the derivative with the vertical   scale included and from this we can see that in fact our estimates are pretty   close to reality....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that this idea of estimating values of derivatives   can be a tricky process and does require a fair amount of (possible bad)   approximations so while it can be used, you need to be careful with it....\u00a0...We\u2019ll close out this section by noting that while we\u2019re not going to include an example here we could also use the graph of the derivative to give us a sketch of the function itself.\u00a0 In fact, in the next chapter where we discuss some applications of the derivative we will be looking using information the derivative gives us to sketch the graph of a function.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/DerivativeInterp.aspx", "media":

...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some more complicated examples involving exponentials.\u00a0 In the following set of examples it won\u2019t be that the exponents are more complicated, but instead that there will be more than one exponential function to deal with....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the only difference between these two limits is the   fact that in the first we\u2019re taking the limit as we go to plus infinity and   in the second we\u2019re going to minus infinity.\u00a0   To this point we\u2019ve been able to \u201creuse\u201d work from the first limit in   the at least a portion of the second limit.\u00a0   With exponentials that will often not be the case, we\u2019re going to   treat each of these as separate problems.... ...Let\u2019s start by just taking the limit of each of the pieces   and see what we get....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The last two   terms aren\u2019t any problem (they will be in the next part however, do you see   that?).\u00a0 The first three are a problem   however as they present us with another indeterminate form....\u00a0...When dealing   with polynomials we factored out the term with the largest exponent in   it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do the same thing here.\u00a0 However, we now have to deal with both   positive and negative exponents and just what do we mean by the \u201clargest\u201d   exponent.\u00a0 When dealing with these here   we look at the terms that are causing the problems and ask which is the   largest exponent in those terms.\u00a0 So,   since only the first three terms are causing us problems (... they all evaluate to an infinity   in the limit) we\u2019ll look only at those.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...So, since 10... is the largest of the three   exponents there we\u2019ll \u201cfactor\u201d an ...\u00a0out of the whole thing.\u00a0 Just as with polynomials we do the   factoring by, in essence, dividing each term by ...\u00a0and remembering that to simply the division   all we need to do is subtract the exponents.\u00a0   For example, let\u2019s just take a look at the last term,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Doing factoring   on all terms then gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Notice that in   doing this factoring all the remaining exponentials now have negative   exponents and we know that for this limit (... going out to positive infinity) these will all be zero in   the limit and so will no longer cause problems....\u00a0...We can now take   the limit of the two factors.\u00a0 The first   is clearly infinity and the second is clearly a finite number (one in this   case) and so the ...   from the Infinite Limits section gives us the following limit,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To simplify the   work here a little all we really needed to do was factor the ...\u00a0out of the \u201cproblem\u201d terms (the first three   in this case) as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We factored the   ...out of all terms for the practice of   doing the factoring and to avoid any issues with having the extra terms at   the end.\u00a0 Note as well that while we   wrote ...\u00a0for the limit of the first term we are   really using the ...   from the Infinite Limit section to do that limit....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s start this one off in the same manner as the first   part.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take the limit of each of   the pieces.\u00a0 This time note that   because our limit is going to negative infinity the first three exponentials   will in fact go to zero (because their exponents go to minus infinity in the   limit).\u00a0 The final two exponentials   will go to infinity in the limit (because their exponents go to plus infinity   in the limit)....\u00a0...Taking the limits gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, the last   two terms are the problem here as they once again leave us with an   indeterminate form.\u00a0 As with the first   example we\u2019re going to factor out the \u201clargest\u201d exponent in the last two   terms.\u00a0 This time however, \u201clargest\u201d   doesn\u2019t refer to the bigger of the two numbers (-2 is bigger than -15).\u00a0 Instead we\u2019re going to use \u201clargest\u201d to   refer to the exponent that is farther away from zero.\u00a0 Using this definition of \u201clargest\u201d means   that we\u2019re going to factor an ...\u00a0out. ...\u00a0...Again, remember   that to factor this out all we really are doing is dividing each term by ...\u00a0and then subtracting exponents.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the work for the first term as an   example,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the   first part we can either factor it out of only the \u201cproblem\u201d terms (... the last two terms), or all the   terms.\u00a0 For the practice we\u2019ll factor   it out of all the terms.\u00a0 Here is the   factoring work for this limit,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally, after   taking the limit of the two terms (the first is infinity and the second is a   negative, finite number) and recalling the ... from the Infinite   Limit section we see that the limit is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, when dealing with sums and/or differences of exponential functions we look for the exponential with the \u201clargest\u201d exponent and remember here that \u201clargest\u201d means the exponent farthest from zero.\u00a0 Also remember that if we\u2019re looking at a limit at plus infinity only the exponentials with positive exponents are going to cause problems so those are the only terms we look at in determining the largest exponent.\u00a0 Likewise, if we are looking at a limit at minus infinity then only exponentials with negative exponents are going to cause problems and so only those are looked at in determining the largest exponent....\u00a0...Finally, as you might have been able to guess from the previous example when dealing with a sum and/or difference of exponentials all we need to do is look at the largest exponent to determine the behavior of the whole expression.\u00a0 Again, remembering that if the limit is at plus infinity we only look at exponentials with positive exponents and if we\u2019re looking at a limit at minus infinity we only look at exponentials with negative exponents....\u00a0...Let\u2019s next take a look at some rational functions involving exponentials....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...As with the previous example, the only difference between   the first two parts is that one of the limits is going to plus infinity and   the other is going to minus infinity and just as with the previous example   each will need to be worked differently....   ...   ...The basic concept involved in working this problem is the   same as with rational expressions in the previous section.\u00a0 We look at the denominator and determine   the exponential function with the \u201clargest\u201d exponent which we will then   factor out from both numerator and denominator.\u00a0 We will use the same reasoning as we did   with the previous example to determine the \u201clargest\u201d exponent.\u00a0 In the case since we are looking at a limit   at plus infinity we only look at exponentials with positive exponents....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ll factor an ...\u00a0out of both then numerator and   denominator.\u00a0 Once that is done we can   cancel the ...\u00a0and then take the limit of the remaining   terms.\u00a0 Here is the work for this   limit,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...In this case we\u2019re going to minus infinity in the limit   and so we\u2019ll look at exponentials in the denominator with negative exponents   in determining the \u201clargest\u201d exponent.\u00a0   There\u2019s only one however in this problem so that is what we\u2019ll   use.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Again, remember to only look at the denominator.\u00a0 Do NOT use the exponential from the   numerator, even though that one is \u201clarger\u201d than the exponential in the denominator.\u00a0 We always look only at   the denominator when determining what term to factor out regardless of what   is going on in the numerator....\u00a0...Here is the work for this part....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...We\u2019ll do the work on this part with much less detail....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s take a quick look at some basic limits involving logarithms....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....As with the last example I\u2019ll leave it to you to verify   these restatements from the .......\u00a0...Note that we had to do a right-handed limit for the first   one since we can\u2019t plug negative ...\u2019s   into a logarithm.\u00a0 This means that the   normal limit won\u2019t exist since we must look at ...\u2019s from both sides of the point in question and ...\u2019s to the left of zero are negative....\u00a0...From the previous example we can see that if the argument of a log (the stuff we\u2019re taking the log of) goes to zero from the right (... always positive) then the log goes to negative infinity in the limit while if the argument goes to infinity then the log also goes to infinity in the limit....\u00a0...Note as well that we can\u2019t look at a limit of a logarithm as ... approaches minus infinity since we can\u2019t plug negative numbers into the logarithm....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at some logarithm examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...So, let\u2019s first look to see what the argument of the log is   doing,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The argument of   the log is going to infinity and so the log must also be going to infinity in   the limit.\u00a0 The answer to this part is   then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...First, note that the limit going to negative infinity here   isn\u2019t a violation (necessarily) of the fact that we can\u2019t plug negative   numbers into the logarithm.\u00a0 The real   issue is whether or not the argument of the log will be negative or not....\u00a0...Using the techniques from earlier in this section we can   see that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0and let\u2019s also note that for negative numbers   (which we can assume we\u2019ve got since we\u2019re going to minus infinity in the   limit) the denominator will always be positive and so the quotient will also   always be positive.\u00a0 Therefore, not   only does the argument go to zero, it goes to zero from the right.\u00a0 This is exactly what we need to do this   limit....\u00a0...So, the answer   here is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...As a final set of examples let\u2019s take a look at some limits involving inverse tangents....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...The first two parts here are really just the basic limits   involving inverse tangents and can easily be found by examining the following   sketch of inverse tangents.\u00a0 The   remaining two parts are more involved but as with the exponential and   logarithm limits really just refer back to the first two parts as we\u2019ll see....\u00a0... ...As noted above all we really need to do here is look at   the graph of the inverse tangent.\u00a0   Doing this shows us that we have the following value of the limit....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...Again, not much   to do here other than examine the graph of the inverse tangent....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Okay, in part (a) above we saw that if the argument of the   inverse tangent function (the stuff inside the parenthesis) goes to plus   infinity then we know the value of the limit.\u00a0   In this case (using the techniques from the previous section) we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, this limit   is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...Even though this limit is not a limit at infinity we\u2019re   still looking at the same basic idea here.\u00a0   We\u2019ll use part (b) from above as a guide for this limit.\u00a0 We know from the ... section that   we have the following limit for the argument of this inverse tangent,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, since the   argument goes to minus infinity in the limit we know that this limit must be,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we will take a look at limits whose value is infinity or minus infinity.\u00a0 These kinds of limit will show up fairly regularly in later sections and in other courses and so you\u2019ll need to be able to deal with them when you run across them....\u00a0...The first thing we should probably do here is to define just what we mean when we say that a limit has a value of infinity or minus infinity....\u00a0...We say...if we can make ...   arbitrarily large for all ...   sufficiently close to ..., from   both sides, without actually letting ....   ...\u00a0...We say...if we can make ...   arbitrarily large and negative for all ...   sufficiently close to ..., from   both sides, without actually letting ....   ...\u00a0...These definitions can be appropriately modified for the one-sided limits as well.\u00a0 To see a more precise and mathematical definition of this kind of limit see the ... section at the end of this chapter. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with a fairly typical example illustrating infinite limits....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....So we\u2019re going to be taking a look at a couple of   one-sided limits as well as the normal limit here.\u00a0 In all three cases notice that we can\u2019t   just plug in ....\u00a0 If we did we would get division by   zero.\u00a0 Also recall that the definitions   above can be easily modified to give similar definitions for the two   one-sided limits which we\u2019ll be needing here....\u00a0...Now, there are several ways we could proceed here to get   values for these limits.\u00a0 One way is to   plug in some points and see what value the function is approaching.\u00a0 In the preceding section we said that we   were no longer going to do this, but in this case it is a good way to   illustrate just what\u2019s going on with this function....\u00a0...So, here is a table of values of ...\u2019s from both the left and the right.\u00a0 Using these values we\u2019ll be able to   estimate the value of the two one-sided limits and once we have that done we   can use the ... that the normal   limit will exist only if the two one-sided limits exist and have the same   value....\u00a0...-0.1...-10...0.1...10...-0.01...-100...0.01...100...-0.001...-1000...0.001...1000...-0.0001...-10000...0.0001...10000...\u00a0...From this table we can see that as we make ... smaller and smaller the function ...\u00a0gets larger and larger and will retain the   same sign that ... originally   had.\u00a0 It should make sense that this   trend will continue for any smaller value of ... that we chose to use.\u00a0   The function is a constant (one in this case) divided by an   increasingly small number.\u00a0 The   resulting fraction should be an increasingly large number and as noted above   the fraction will retain the same sign as .......\u00a0...We can make the function as large and positive as we want   for all ...\u2019s sufficiently close to   zero while staying positive (...   on the right).\u00a0 Likewise, we can make   the function as large and negative as we want for all ...\u2019s sufficiently close to zero while staying negative (... on the left).\u00a0 So, from our definition above it looks like   we should have the following values for the two one sided limits....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Another way to see the values of the two one sided limits   here is to graph the function.\u00a0 Again,   in the previous section we mentioned that we won\u2019t do this too often as most   functions are not something we can just quickly sketch out as well as the   problems with accuracy in reading values off the graph.\u00a0 In this case however, it\u2019s not too hard to   sketch a graph of the function and, in this case as we\u2019ll see accuracy is not   really going to be an issue.\u00a0 So, here   is a quick sketch of the graph....\u00a0...So, we can see from this graph that the function does   behave much as we predicted that it would from our table values.\u00a0 The closer ... gets to zero from the right the larger (in the positive sense)   the function gets, while the closer ...   gets to zero from the left the larger (in the negative sense) the function   gets....\u00a0...Finally, the normal limit, in this case, will not exist   since the two one-sided limits have different values....\u00a0...So, in summary here are the values of the three limits for   this example....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...For most of the remaining examples in this section we\u2019ll attempt to \u201ctalk our way through\u201d each limit.\u00a0 This means that we\u2019ll see if we can analyze what should happen to the function as we get very close to the point in question without actually plugging in any values into the function.\u00a0 For most of the following examples this kind of analysis shouldn\u2019t be all that difficult to do.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also verify our analysis with a quick graph....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s do a couple more examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....As with the previous example let\u2019s start off by looking at   the two one-sided limits.\u00a0 Once we have   those we\u2019ll be able to determine a value for the normal limit. ...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s take a look at the right-hand limit first and as   noted above let\u2019s see if we can figure out what each limit will   be doing without actually plugging in any values of ... into the function.\u00a0 As we   take smaller and smaller values of ...,   while staying positive, squaring them will only make them smaller (recall   squaring a number between zero and one will make it smaller) and of course it   will stay positive.\u00a0 So we have a   positive constant divided by an increasingly small positive number.\u00a0 The result should then be an increasingly   large positive number.\u00a0 It looks like   we should have the following value for the right-hand limit in this case,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take   a look at the left hand limit.\u00a0 In this   case we\u2019re going to take smaller and smaller values of ..., while staying negative this time.\u00a0 When we square them they\u2019ll get smaller, but   upon squaring the result is now positive.\u00a0   So, we have a positive constant divided by an increasingly small   positive number.\u00a0 The result, as with   the right hand limit, will be an increasingly large positive number and so   the left-hand limit will be,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Now, in this   example, unlike the first one, the normal limit will exist and be infinity   since the two one-sided limits both exist and have the same value.\u00a0 So, in summary here are all the limits for   this example as well as a quick graph verifying the limits....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...With this next example we\u2019ll move away from just an ... in the denominator, but as we\u2019ll see in the next couple of examples they work pretty much the same way....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....Let\u2019s again start with the right-hand limit.\u00a0 With the right hand limit we know that we   have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, as ... gets closer and closer to -2 then ...will be getting closer and closer to   zero, while staying positive as noted above.\u00a0   So, for the right-hand limit, we\u2019ll have a negative constant divided   by an increasingly small positive number.\u00a0   The result will be an increasingly large and negative number.\u00a0 So, it looks like the right-hand limit will   be negative infinity....\u00a0...For the left   hand limit we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and ...\u00a0will get closer and closer to zero (and be   negative) as ... gets closer and   closer to -2.\u00a0 In this case then we\u2019ll   have a negative constant divided by an increasingly small negative   number.\u00a0 The result will then be an   increasingly large positive number and so it looks like the left-hand limit   will be positive infinity....\u00a0...Finally, since   two one sided limits are not the same the normal limit won\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Here are the   official answers for this example as well as a quick graph of the function   for verification purposes....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...At this point we should briefly acknowledge the idea of vertical asymptotes.\u00a0 Each of the three previous graphs have had one.\u00a0 Recall from an Algebra class that a vertical asymptote is a vertical line (the dashed line at ...\u00a0in the previous example) in which the graph will go towards infinity and/or minus infinity on one or both sides of the line.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In an Algebra class they are a little difficult to define other than to say pretty much what we just said.\u00a0 Now that we have infinite limits under our belt we can easily define a vertical asymptote as follows,...\u00a0...The function ...   will have a vertical asymptote at ...\u00a0if we have any of the following limits at .......\u00a0...Note that it only requires one of the above limits for a function to have a vertical asymptote at .......\u00a0...Using this definition we can see that the first two examples had vertical asymptotes at ...\u00a0while the third example had a vertical asymptote at .......\u00a0...We aren\u2019t really going to do a lot with vertical asymptotes here, but wanted to mention them at this point since we\u2019d reached a good point to do that....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a look at a couple more examples of infinite limits that can cause some problems on occasion. ...\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with the right-hand limit.\u00a0 For this limit we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...also, ...\u00a0as ....\u00a0 So, we have a positive constant divided by   an increasingly small negative number.\u00a0   The results will be an increasingly large negative number and so it   looks like the right-hand limit will be negative infinity....\u00a0...For the   left-handed limit we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and we still   have, ...\u00a0as ....\u00a0 In this case we have a positive constant   divided by an increasingly small positive number.\u00a0 The results will be an increasingly large   positive number and so it looks like the left-hand limit will be positive   infinity....\u00a0...The normal   limit will not exist since the two one-sided limits are not the same.\u00a0 The official answers to this example are   then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is a quick   sketch to verify our limits....\u00a0...All the examples to this point have had a constant in the numerator and we should probably take a quick look at an example that doesn\u2019t have a constant in the numerator....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following limits....Let\u2019s take a look at the right-handed limit first.\u00a0 For this limit we\u2019ll have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The main   difference here with this example is the behavior of the numerator as we let ... get closer and closer to 3.\u00a0 In this case we have the following behavior   for both the numerator and denominator....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, as we let ... get closer and closer to 3 (always   staying on the right of course) the numerator, while not a constant, is   getting closer and closer to a positive constant while the denominator is   getting closer and closer to zero, and will be positive since we are on the   right side.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This means that   we\u2019ll have a numerator that is getting closer and closer to a non-zero and   positive constant divided by an increasingly smaller positive number and so   the result should be an increasingly larger positive number.\u00a0 The right-hand limit should then be   positive infinity....\u00a0...For the   left-hand limit we\u2019ll have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the right-hand limit we\u2019ll have the following   behaviors for the numerator and the denominator,...\u00a0...The main difference in this case is that the denominator   will now be negative.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll have a   numerator that is approaching a positive, non-zero constant divided by an   increasingly small negative number.\u00a0   The result will be an increasingly large and negative number....\u00a0...The formal answers for this example are then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with most of   the examples in this section the normal limit does not exist since the two   one-sided limits are not the same....\u00a0...Here\u2019s a quick graph to verify our limits....\u00a0...So far all we\u2019ve done is look at limits of rational expressions, let\u2019s do a couple of quick examples with some different functions....\u00a0...Evaluate   ...First, notice that we can only evaluate the right-handed   limit here.\u00a0 We know that the domain of   any logarithm is only the positive numbers and so we can\u2019t even talk about   the left-handed limit because that would necessitate the use of negative   numbers.\u00a0 Likewise, since we can\u2019t deal   with the left-handed limit then we can\u2019t talk about the normal limit....\u00a0...This limit is pretty simple to get from a quick sketch of   the graph....From this we can see that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Evaluate   both of the following limits....Here\u2019s a quick sketch of the graph of the tangent   function....\u00a0...From this it\u2019s easy to see that we have the following   values for each of these limits,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Note that the   normal limit will not exist because the two one-sided limits are not the   same....\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave this section with a few facts about infinite limits....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...for some real   numbers ... and ....\u00a0 Then,...\u00a0...\u00a0... If ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0...\u00a0... If ...\u00a0then ...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...To see the proof of this set of facts see the ... section in the Extras chapter....\u00a0...Note as well that the above set of facts also holds for one-sided limits.\u00a0 They will also hold if ..., with a change of sign on the infinities in the first three parts.\u00a0 The proofs of these changes to the facts are nearly identical to the proof of the original facts and so are left to the reader.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/InfiniteLimits.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Infinite Limits", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the previous ... we saw that there is a large class of function that allows us to use...to compute limits.\u00a0 However, there are also many limits for which this won\u2019t work easily.\u00a0 The purpose of this section is to develop techniques for dealing with some of these limits that will not allow us to just use this fact....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first got back and take a look at one of the first limits that we looked at and compute its exact value and verify our guess for the limit....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....First let\u2019s notice that if we try to plug in ...\u00a0we get,...\u00a0...So, we can\u2019t just plug in ...\u00a0to evaluate the limit.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going to have to do something   else.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first thing that we should always do when evaluating   limits is to simplify the function as much as possible.\u00a0 In this case that means factoring both the   numerator and denominator.\u00a0 Doing this   gives,...\u00a0...So, upon factoring we saw that we could cancel an ...\u00a0from both the numerator and the   denominator.\u00a0 Upon doing this we now   have a new rational expression that we can plug ...\u00a0into because we lost the division by zero   problem.\u00a0 Therefore, the limit is,...\u00a0...Note that this is in fact what we guessed the limit to be....\u00a0...On a side note, the 0/0 we initially got in the previous example is called an ....\u00a0 This means that we don\u2019t really know what it will be until we do some more work.\u00a0 Typically zero in the denominator means it\u2019s undefined.\u00a0 However that will only be true if the numerator isn\u2019t also zero.\u00a0 Also, zero in the numerator usually means that the fraction is zero, unless the denominator is also zero.\u00a0 Likewise anything divided by itself is 1, unless we\u2019re talking about zero....\u00a0...So, there are really three competing \u201crules\u201d here and it\u2019s not clear which one will win out.\u00a0 It\u2019s also possible that none of them will win out and we will get something totally different from undefined, zero, or one.\u00a0 We might, for instance, get a value of 4 out of this, to pick a number completely at random....\u00a0...There are many more kinds of indeterminate forms and we will be discussing indeterminate forms at length in the next chapter....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of more examples....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....In this case we also get 0/0 and factoring is not really   an option.\u00a0 However, there is still   some simplification that we can do....\u00a0...So, upon multiplying out the first term we get a little   cancellation and now notice that we can factor an ... out of both terms in the numerator which will cancel against   the ... in the denominator and the   division by zero problem goes away and we can then evaluate the limit....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....This limit is going to be a little more work than the   previous two.\u00a0 Once again however note   that we get the indeterminate form 0/0 if we try to just evaluate the   limit.\u00a0 Also note that neither of the   two examples will be of any help here, at least initially.\u00a0 We can\u2019t factor and we can\u2019t just multiply   something out to get the function to simplify....\u00a0...When there is a square root in the numerator or   denominator we can try to rationalize and see if that helps.\u00a0 Recall that rationalizing makes use of the   fact that...So, if either the first and/or the second term have a   square root in them the rationalizing will eliminate the root(s).\u00a0 This ...   help in evaluating the limit....\u00a0...Let\u2019s try rationalizing the numerator in this case.\u00a0 ...Remember that to rationalize we just take the numerator   (since that\u2019s what we\u2019re rationalizing), change the sign on the second term   and multiply the numerator and denominator by this new term....\u00a0...Next, we multiply the numerator out being careful to watch   minus signs....\u00a0...Notice that we didn\u2019t multiply the denominator out as   well.\u00a0 Most students come out of an   Algebra class having it beaten into their heads to always multiply this stuff   out.\u00a0 However, in this case multiplying   out will make the problem very difficult and in the end you\u2019ll just end up   factoring it back out anyway....\u00a0...At this stage we are almost done.\u00a0 Notice that we can factor the numerator so   let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Now all we need to do is notice that if we factor a   \u201c-1\u201dout of the first term in the denominator we can do some canceling.\u00a0 At that point the division by zero problem   will go away and we can evaluate the limit....\u00a0...Note that if we had multiplied the denominator out we   would not have been able to do this canceling and in all likelihood would not   have even seen that some canceling could have been done....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve taken a look at a couple of limits in which evaluation gave the indeterminate form 0/0 and we now have a couple of things to try in these cases....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another kind of problem that can arise in computing some limits involving piecewise functions....\u00a0...Given   the function,...Compute the following limits....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0 ...In this case there really isn\u2019t a whole lot to do.\u00a0 In doing limits recall that we must always   look at what\u2019s happening on both sides of the point in question as we move in   towards it.\u00a0 In this case ...\u00a0is completely inside the second interval for   the function and so there are values of ...   on both sides of ...\u00a0that are also inside this interval.\u00a0 This means that we can just use the fact to   evaluate this limit....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...This part is the real point to this problem.\u00a0 In this case the point that we want to take   the limit for is the cutoff point for the two intervals.\u00a0 In other words we can\u2019t just plug ...\u00a0into the second portion because this   interval does not contain values of ...   to the left of ...\u00a0and we need to know what is happening on   both sides of the point....\u00a0...To do this part we are going to have to remember the fact   from the section on ...   that says that if the two one-sided limits exist and are the same then the   normal limit will also exist and have the same value....\u00a0...Notice that both of the one sided limits can be done here   since we are only going to be looking at one side of the point in question.\u00a0 So let\u2019s do the two one-sided limits and   see what we get....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this case we can see that,...and so since the two one sided limits aren\u2019t the same ...doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Note that a very simple change to the function will make the limit at ...\u00a0exist so don\u2019t get in into your head that limits at these cutoff points in piecewise function don\u2019t ever exist....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....The two one-sided limits this time are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The one-sided limits are the same so we get,...\u00a0...There is one more limit that we need to do.\u00a0 However, we will need a new fact about limits that will help us to do this....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0for all ...   on [...] (except possibly at ...) and ...\u00a0then,...\u00a0...Note that this fact should make some sense to you if we assume that both functions are nice enough.\u00a0 If both of the functions are \u201cnice enough\u201d to use the limit evaluation ... then we have,...The inequality is true because we know that ... is somewhere between ... and ... and in that range we also know ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we don\u2019t really need the two functions to be nice enough for the fact to be true, but it does provide a nice way to give a quick \u201cjustification\u201d for the fact....\u00a0...Also, note that we said that we assumed that ...\u00a0for all ... on [...] (except possibly at ...).\u00a0 Because limits do not care what is actually happening at ...\u00a0we don\u2019t really need the inequality to hold at that specific point.\u00a0 We only need it to hold around ...\u00a0since that is what the limit is concerned about....\u00a0...We can take this fact one step farther to get the following theorem....\u00a0...Suppose that for all ...   on [...] (except possibly at ...) we have,...Also suppose that,...for some ...\u00a0   Then,...\u00a0...As with the previous fact we only need to know that ...\u00a0is true around ...\u00a0because we are working with limits and they are only concerned with what is going on around ...\u00a0and not what is actually happening at .......\u00a0...Now, if we again assume that all three functions are nice enough (again this isn\u2019t required to make the Squeeze Theorem true, it only helps with the visualization) then we can get a quick sketch of what the Squeeze Theorem is telling us.\u00a0 The following figure illustrates what is happening in this theorem....\u00a0...From the figure we can see that if the limits of ... and ... are equal at ...\u00a0then the function values must also be equal at ...\u00a0(this is where we\u2019re using the fact that we assumed the functions where \u201cnice enough\u201d, which isn\u2019t really required for the Theorem).\u00a0 However, because ... is \u201csqueezed\u201d between ... and ... at this point then ... must have the same value.\u00a0 Therefore, the limit of ... at this point must also be the same....\u00a0...The Squeeze theorem is also known as the ... and the .......\u00a0...So, how do we use this theorem to help us with limits?\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at the following example to see the theorem in action....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....In this example none of the previous examples can help   us.\u00a0 There\u2019s no factoring or   simplifying to do.\u00a0 We can\u2019t   rationalize and one-sided limits won\u2019t work.\u00a0   There\u2019s even a question as to whether this limit will exist since we   have division by zero inside the cosine at .......\u00a0...The first thing to notice is that we know the following   fact about cosine....Our function doesn\u2019t have just an ... in the cosine, but as long as we avoid ...\u00a0we can say the same thing for our cosine....It\u2019s okay for us to ignore ...\u00a0here because we are taking a limit and we   know that limits don\u2019t care about what\u2019s actually going on at the point in   question, ...\u00a0in this case....Now if we have the above inequality for our cosine we can   just multiply everything by an ...   and get the following....\u00a0...In other words we\u2019ve managed to squeeze the function that   we were interested in between two other functions that are very easy to deal   with.\u00a0 So, the limits of the two outer   functions are....\u00a0...These are the same and so by the Squeeze theorem we must   also have,...\u00a0...We can verify this with the graph of the three   functions.\u00a0 This is shown below....\u00a0...In this section we\u2019ve seen several tools that we can use to help us to compute limits in which we can\u2019t just evaluate the function at the point in question.\u00a0 As we will see many of the limits that we\u2019ll be doing in later

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "The time has almost come for us to actually compute some limits.\u00a0 However, before we do that we will need some properties of limits that will make our life somewhat easier.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at those first.\u00a0 The proof of some of these properties can be found in the ... section of the Extras chapter....\u00a0...First we will assume that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0exist and that ... is any constant.\u00a0 Then,...In other words we can \u201cfactor\u201d a   multiplicative constant out of a limit....\u00a0...So to take the limit of a sum or   difference all we need to do is take the limit of the individual parts and then   put them back together with the appropriate sign.\u00a0 This is also not limited to two   functions.\u00a0 This fact will work no   matter how many functions we\u2019ve got separated by \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d....\u00a0...We take the limits of products in   the same way that we can take the limit of sums or differences.\u00a0 Just take the limit of the pieces and then   put them back together.\u00a0 Also, as with   sums or differences, this fact is not limited to just two functions....\u00a0...As noted in the statement we only   need to worry about the limit in the denominator being zero when we do the   limit of a quotient.\u00a0 If it were zero   we would end up with a division by zero error and we need to avoid that....\u00a0...In this property ... can be any real number (positive,   negative, integer, fraction, irrational, zero, ...).\u00a0 In the case that ... is an integer this rule can be   thought of as an extended case of .......\u00a0...For example consider the case of ...2....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

words, the limit of a   constant is just the constant.\u00a0 You   should be able to convince yourself of this by drawing the graph of .......\u00a0...As with the last one you should   be able to convince yourself of this by drawing the graph of .......This is really   just a special case of property ...   using .......\u00a0...Note that all these properties also hold for the two one-sided limits as well we just didn\u2019t write them down with one sided limits to save on space....\u00a0...Let\u2019s compute a limit or two using these properties.\u00a0 The next couple of examples will lead us to some truly useful facts about limits that we will use on a continual basis....\u00a0...Compute   the value of the following limit....This first time through we will use only the properties   above to compute the limit. ...\u00a0...First we will use property ... to break up the limit into three separate limits.\u00a0 We will then use property ... to bring the constants out of the   first two limits.\u00a0 Doing this gives us,...\u00a0...We can now use properties ... through ... to   actually compute the limit....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s notice that if we had defined...then the proceeding example would have been,...\u00a0...In other words, in this case we see that the limit is the same value that we\u2019d get by just evaluating the function at the point in question.\u00a0 This seems to violate one of the main concepts about limits that we\u2019ve seen to this point. ...\u00a0...In the previous two sections we made a big deal about the fact that limits do not care about what is happening at the point in question.\u00a0 They only care about what is happening around the point.\u00a0 So how does the previous example fit into this since it appears to violate this main idea about limits?...\u00a0...Despite appearances the limit still doesn\u2019t care about what the function is doing at ....\u00a0 In this case the function that we\u2019ve got is simply \u201cnice enough\u201d so that what is happening around the point is exactly the same as what is happening at the point.\u00a0 ... we will formalize up just what is meant by \u201cnice enough\u201d.\u00a0 At this point let\u2019s not worry too much about what \u201cnice enough\u201d is.\u00a0 Let\u2019s just take advantage of the fact that some functions will be \u201cnice enough\u201d, whatever that means....\u00a0...The function in the last example was a polynomial.\u00a0 It turns out that all polynomials are \u201cnice enough\u201d so that what is happening around the point is exactly the same as what is happening at the point.\u00a0 This leads to the following fact....\u00a0...\u00a0...If ... is a   polynomial then,...\u00a0...By the end of this section we will generalize this out considerably to most of the functions that we\u2019ll be seeing throughout this course....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....First notice that we can use property ... to write the limit as,...\u00a0...Well, actually we should be a little careful.\u00a0 We can do that provided the limit of the   denominator isn\u2019t zero.\u00a0 As we will see   however, it isn\u2019t in this case so we\u2019re okay....\u00a0...Now, both the numerator and denominator are polynomials so   we can use the fact above to compute the limits of the numerator and the   denominator and hence the limit itself....\u00a0...Notice that the limit of the denominator wasn\u2019t zero and   so our use of property ... was   legitimate....\u00a0...Notice in this last example that again all we really did was evaluate the function at the point in question.\u00a0 So it appears that there is a fairly large class of functions for which this can be done.\u00a0 Let\u2019s generalize the fact from above a little....\u00a0...Provided ... is   \u201cnice enough\u201d we have,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, we will formalize up just what we mean by \u201cnice enough\u201d ....\u00a0 At this point all we want to do is worry about which functions are \u201cnice enough\u201d.\u00a0 Some functions are \u201cnice enough\u201d for all ... while others will only be \u201cnice enough\u201d for certain values of ....\u00a0 It will all depend on the function....\u00a0...As noted in the statement, this fact also holds for the two one-sided limits as well as the normal limit....\u00a0...Here is a list of some of the more common functions that are \u201cnice enough\u201d....\u00a0...\u00a0...The last bullet is important.\u00a0 This means that for any combination of these functions all we need to do is evaluate the function at the point in question, making sure that none of the restrictions are violated.\u00a0 This means that we can now do a large number of limits....\u00a0...Evaluate   the following limit....This is a combination of several of the functions listed   above and none of the restrictions are violated so all we need to do is plug   in ...\u00a0into the function to get the limit....\u00a0...Not a very pretty answer, but we can now do the limit.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/LimitsProperties.aspx",

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we\u2019re going to be taking a look at the precise, mathematical definition of the three kinds of limits we looked at in this chapter.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be looking at the precise definition of limits at finite points that have finite values, limits that are infinity and limits at infinity.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also give the precise, mathematical definition of continuity....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start this section out with the definition of a limit at a finite point that has a finite value....\u00a0...Let   ... be a function defined on an   interval that contains ...,   except possibly at ....\u00a0 Then we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...Wow.\u00a0 That\u2019s a mouth full.\u00a0 Now that it\u2019s written down, just what does this mean? ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at the following graph and let\u2019s also assume that the limit does exist....What the definition is telling us is that for ... number ...\u00a0that we pick we can go to our graph and sketch two horizontal lines at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0as shown on the graph above.\u00a0 Then somewhere out there in the world is another number ..., which we will need to determine, that will allow us to add in two vertical lines to our graph at ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Now, if we take any ... in the pink region, ... between ...\u00a0and ..., then this ... will be closer to ... than either of ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Or, ...\u00a0...If we now identify the point on the graph that our choice of ... gives then this point on the graph ... lie in the intersection of the pink and yellow region.\u00a0 This means that this function value ... will be closer to ... than either of ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Or,...\u00a0...So, if we take any value of ... in the pink region then the graph for those values of ... will lie in the yellow region....\u00a0...Notice that there are actually an infinite number of possible ...\u2019s that we can choose.\u00a0 In fact, if we go back and look at the graph above it looks like we could have taken a slightly larger ...\u00a0and still gotten the graph from that pink region to be completely contained in the yellow region....\u00a0...Also, notice that as the definition points out we only need to make sure that the function is defined in some interval around ...\u00a0but we don\u2019t really care if it is defined at ....\u00a0 Remember that limits do not care what is happening at the point, they only care what is happening around the point in question....\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve gotten the definition out of the way and made an attempt to understand it let\u2019s see how it\u2019s actually used in practice....\u00a0...These are a little tricky sometimes and it can take a lot of practice to get good at these so don\u2019t feel too bad if you don\u2019t pick up on this stuff right away.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be looking at a couple of examples that work out fairly easily....\u00a0...Use   the definition of the limit to prove the following limit....In this case both ...   and ... are zero.\u00a0 So, let ...\u00a0be any number.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry about what the number is, ...\u00a0is just some arbitrary number.\u00a0\u00a0 Now according to the definition of the   limit, if this limit is to be true we will need to find some other number ...\u00a0so that the following will be true....\u00a0...\u00a0...Or upon simplifying things we need,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Often the way to go through these is to start with the   left inequality and do a little simplification and see if that suggests a   choice for ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll start by bringing the exponent out of   the absolute value bars and then taking the square root of both sides....\u00a0...Now, the results of this simplification looks an awful lot   like ...\u00a0with the exception of the \u201c ...\u201d part.\u00a0 Missing that however isn\u2019t a problem, it is   just telling us that we can\u2019t take ....\u00a0 So, it looks like if we choose ...\u00a0we should get what we want.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll next need to verify that our choice of ...\u00a0will give us what we want, ...,...\u00a0...Verification is in fact pretty much the same work that we   did to get our guess.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s   again let ...\u00a0be any number and then choose ....\u00a0 Now, assume that ....\u00a0 We need to show that by choosing ... to satisfy this we will get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...To start the verification process we\u2019ll start with ...\u00a0and then first strip out the exponent from   the absolute values.\u00a0 Once this is done   we\u2019ll use our assumption on ...,   namely that ....\u00a0 Doing all this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Or, upon taking   the middle terms out, if we assume that ...\u00a0then we will get,...and this is exactly what we needed to show....\u00a0...So, just what have we done?\u00a0 We\u2019ve shown that if we choose ...\u00a0then we can find a ...\u00a0so that we have,...and according to our definition this means that,...\u00a0...These can be a little tricky the first couple times through.\u00a0 Especially when it seems like we\u2019ve got to do the work twice.\u00a0 In the previous example we did some simplification on the left hand inequality to get our guess for ...\u00a0and then seemingly went through exactly the same work to then prove that our guess was correct.\u00a0 This is often how these work, although we will see an example here in a bit where things don\u2019t work out quite so nicely....\u00a0...So, having said that let\u2019s take a look at a slightly more complicated limit, although this one will still be fairly similar to the first example....\u00a0...Use   the definition of the limit to prove the following limit....We\u2019ll start this one out the same way that we did the   first one.\u00a0 We won\u2019t be putting in   quite the same amount of explanation however....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off by letting ...\u00a0be any number then we need to find a number ...so that the following will be true....\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ll start by simplifying the left inequality in an   attempt to get a guess for ....\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, as with the   first example it looks like if we do enough simplification on the left   inequality we get something that looks an awful lot like the right inequality   and this leads us to choose .......Let\u2019s now   verify this guess.\u00a0 So, again let ...\u00a0be any number and then choose ....\u00a0 Next, assume that ...\u00a0and we get the following,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...So, we\u2019ve shown   that ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0and so by our definition we have,...\u00a0...Okay, so again the process seems to suggest that we have to essentially redo all our work twice, once to make the guess for ...and then another time to prove our guess. \u00a0Let\u2019s do an example that doesn\u2019t work out quite so nicely....\u00a0...Use   the definition of the limit to prove the following limit....So, let\u2019s get started.\u00a0   Let ...\u00a0be any number then we need to find a number ...so that the following will be true....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll start the   guess process in the same manner as the previous two examples....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve   managed to show that ...\u00a0is equivalent to ....\u00a0 However, unlike the previous two examples,   we\u2019ve got an extra term in here that doesn\u2019t show up in the right inequality   above.\u00a0 If we have any hope of   proceeding here we\u2019re going to need to find some way to get rid of the .......\u00a0...To do this   let\u2019s just note that if, by some chance, we can show that ...\u00a0for some number ... then, we\u2019ll have the following,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If we now   assume that what we really want to show is ...\u00a0instead of ...\u00a0we get the following,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is   starting to seem familiar isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 ...\u00a0...All this work   however, is based on the assumption that we can show that ...\u00a0for some ....\u00a0 Without this assumption we can\u2019t do   anything so let\u2019s see if we can do this....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first   remember that we are working on a limit here and let\u2019s also remember that   limits are only really concerned with what is happening around the point in   question, ...\u00a0in this case.\u00a0 So, it is safe to assume that whatever ... is, it must be close to ....\u00a0 This means we can safely assume that   whatever ... is, it is within a   distance of, say one of ....\u00a0 Or in terms of an inequality, we can assume   that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Why choose 1   here?\u00a0 There is no reason other than   it\u2019s a nice number to work with.\u00a0 We   could just have easily chosen 2, or 5, or ....\u00a0 The only difference our choice will make is   on the actual value of ... that we   end up with.\u00a0 You might want to go   through this process with another choice of ... and see if you can do it....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start   with ...\u00a0and get rid of the absolute value bars and   this solve the resulting inequality for ...   as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If we now add 5   to all parts of this inequality we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, since ...\u00a0(the positive part is important here) we can   say that, provided ...\u00a0we know that ....\u00a0 Or, if take the double inequality above we   have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, provided ...\u00a0we can see that ...\u00a0which in turn gives us,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, to this   point we make two assumptions about ...\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve assumed that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It may not seem   like it, but we\u2019re now ready to chose a ....\u00a0 In the previous examples we had only a   single assumption and we used that to give us ....\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ve got two and they BOTH   need to be true.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll let ...\u00a0be the smaller of the two assumptions, 1 and   ....\u00a0 Mathematically, this is written as,...\u00a0...By doing this   we can guarantee that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Now that we\u2019ve   made our choice for ...\u00a0we need to verify it.\u00a0 So, ...\u00a0be any number and then choose ....\u00a0 Assume that ....\u00a0 First, we get that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We also get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally, all we   need to do is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ve now   managed to show that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and so by our   definition we have,...\u00a0...Okay, that was a lot more work that the first two examples and unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t all that difficult of a problem.\u00a0 Well, maybe we should say that in comparison to some of the other limits we could have tried to prove it wasn\u2019t all that difficult.\u00a0 When first faced with these kinds of proofs using the precise definition of a limit they can all seem pretty difficult.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Do not feel bad if you don\u2019t get this stuff right away.\u00a0 It\u2019s very common to not understand this right away and to have to struggle a little to fully start to understand how these kinds of limit definition proofs work....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s give the precise definitions for the right- and left-handed limits....\u00a0...For   the right-hand limit we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...For   the left-hand limit we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...Note that with both of these definitions there are two ways to deal with the restriction on ... and the one in parenthesis is probably the easier to use, although the main one given more closely matches the definition of the normal limit above....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a quick example of one of these, although as you\u2019ll see they work in much the same manner as the normal limit problems do....\u00a0...Use   the definition of the limit to prove the following limit....Let ...\u00a0be any number then we need to find a number ...so that the following will be true....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Or upon a   little simplification we need to show,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the   previous problems let\u2019s start with the left hand inequality and see if we   can\u2019t use that to get a guess for ....\u00a0 The only simplification that we really need   to do here is to square both sides....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, it looks   like we can chose .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s verify   this.\u00a0 Let ...\u00a0be any number and chose ....\u00a0 Next assume that ....\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...We now shown   that,...and so by the definition of the right-hand limit we have,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s now move onto the definition of infinite limits.\u00a0 Here are the two definitions that we need to cover both possibilities, limits that are positive infinity and limits that are negative infinity....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let   ... be a function defined on an   interval that contains ...,   except possibly at ....\u00a0 Then we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...Let   ... be a function defined on an   interval that contains ...,   except possibly at ....\u00a0 Then we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...In these two definitions note that ... must be a positive number and that ... must be a negative number.\u00a0 That\u2019s an easy distinction to miss if you aren\u2019t paying close attention.\u00a0 ...Also note that we could also write down definitions for one-sided limits that are infinity if we wanted to.\u00a0 We\u2019ll leave that to you to do if you\u2019d like to....\u00a0...Here is a quick sketch illustrating Definition 4....\u00a0...What Definition 4 is telling us is that no matter how large we choose ... to be we can always find an interval around ..., given by ...\u00a0for some number ..., so that as long as we stay within that interval the graph of the function will be above the line ...as shown in the graph.\u00a0 Also note that we don\u2019t need the function to actually exist at ...\u00a0in order for the definition to hold.\u00a0 This is also illustrated in the sketch above....\u00a0...Note as well that the larger ... is the smaller we\u2019re probably going to need to make .......\u00a0...To see an illustration of Definition 5 reflect the above graph about the ...-axis and you\u2019ll see a sketch of Definition 5....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a quick example of one of these to see how these differ from the previous examples....\u00a0...Use   the definition of the limit to prove the following limit....These work in pretty much the same manner as the previous   set of examples do.\u00a0 The main   difference is that we\u2019re working with an ...   now instead of an ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s get going....\u00a0...Let ...\u00a0be any number and we\u2019ll need to choose a ...\u00a0so that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the all   the previous problems we\u2019ll start with the left inequality and try to get   something in the end that looks like the right inequality.\u00a0 To do this we\u2019ll basically solve the left   inequality for ... and we\u2019ll need to   recall that ....\u00a0 So, here\u2019s that work....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...So, it looks   like we can chose ....\u00a0 All we need to do now is verify this guess....\u00a0...Let ...\u00a0be any number, choose ...\u00a0and assume that ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the previous   examples we tried to show that our assumptions satisfied the left inequality   by working with it directly.\u00a0 However,   in this, the function and our assumption on ... that we\u2019ve got actually will make this easier to start with the   assumption on ... and show that we   can get the left inequality out of that.\u00a0   Note that this is being done this way mostly because of the function   that we\u2019re working with and not because of the type of limit that we\u2019ve got....\u00a0...Doing this work   gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve   managed to show that,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and so by the   definition of the limit we have,...\u00a0...For our next set of limit definitions let\u2019s take a look at the two definitions for limits at infinity.\u00a0 Again, we need one for a limit at plus infinity and another for negative infinity....\u00a0...Let   ... be a function defined on ...for some ....\u00a0 Then we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...Let   ... be a function defined on ...for some ....\u00a0 Then we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...To see what these definitions are telling us here is a quick sketch illustrating Definition 6.\u00a0\u00a0 Definition 6 tells us is that no matter how close to ... we want to get, mathematically this is given by ...\u00a0for any chosen ..., we can find another number ... such that provided we take any ... bigger than ..., then the graph of the function for that ... will be closer to ... than either ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Or, in other words, the graph will be in the shaded region as shown in the sketch below....\u00a0...Finally, note that the smaller we make ...\u00a0the larger we\u2019ll probably need to make .......\u00a0...Here\u2019s a quick example of one of these limits....\u00a0...Use   the definition of the limit to prove the following limit....Let ...\u00a0be any number and we\u2019ll need to choose a ...\u00a0so

working with here suggests that it will be easier to start with   this assumption and show that we can get the left inequality out of

...\u00a0...Note that when   we took the absolute value of both sides we changed both sides from negative   numbers to positive numbers and so also had to change the direction of the

 definition of the limit we have,...\u00a0...For our final limit definition let\u2019s look at limits at infinity that are also infinite in value.\u00a0 There are four possible limits to define here.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do one of them and leave the other three to you to write down if you\u2019d like to....\u00a0...Let   ... be a function defined on ...for some ....\u00a0 Then we say that,...if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...The other three definitions are almost identical.\u00a0 The only differences are the signs of ... and/or ... and the corresponding inequality directions....\u00a0...As a final definition in this section let\u2019s recall that we previously said that a function was continuous if,...\u00a0...So, since continuity, as we previously defined it, is defined in terms of a limit we can also now give a more precise definition of continuity.\u00a0 Here it is,...\u00a0...Let   ... be a function defined on an   interval that contains ....\u00a0 Then we say that ... is continuous at ...\u00a0if for every number ...\u00a0there is some number ...such that...\u00a0...This definition is very similar to the first definition in this section and of course that should make some sense since that is exactly the kind of limit that we\u2019re doing to show that a function is continuous.\u00a0 The only real difference is that here we need to make sure that the function is actually defined at ..., while we didn\u2019t need to worry about that for the first definition since limits don\u2019t really care what is happening at the point....\u00a0...We won\u2019t do any examples of proving a function is continuous at a point here mostly because we\u2019ve already done some examples.\u00a0 Go back and look at the first three examples.\u00a0 In each of these examples the value of the limit was the value of the function evaluated at ...\u00a0and so in each of these examples not only did we prove the value of the

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to take a look at two fairly important problems in the study of calculus.\u00a0 There are two reasons for looking at these problems now.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, both of these problems will lead us into the study of limits, which is the topic of this chapter after all.\u00a0 Looking at these problems here will allow us to start to understand just what a limit is and what it can tell us about a function....\u00a0...Secondly, the rate of change problem that we\u2019re going to be looking at is one of the most important concepts that we\u2019ll encounter in the second chapter of this course.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s probably one of the most important concepts that we\u2019ll encounter in the whole course.\u00a0 So looking at it now will get us to start thinking about it from the very beginning....\u00a0...The first problem that we\u2019re going to take a look at is the tangent line problem.\u00a0 Before getting into this problem it would probably be best to define a tangent line....\u00a0...A tangent line to the function ... at the point ...\u00a0is a line that just touches the graph of the function at the point in question and is \u201cparallel\u201d (in some way) to the graph at that point.\u00a0 Take a look at the graph below....\u00a0...In this graph the line is a tangent line at the indicated point because it just touches the graph at that point and is also \u201cparallel\u201d to the graph at that point.\u00a0 Likewise, at the second point shown, the line does just touch the graph at that point, but it is not \u201cparallel\u201d to the graph at that point and so it\u2019s not a tangent line to the graph at that point....\u00a0...At the second point shown (the point where the line isn\u2019t a tangent line) we will sometimes call the line a .......\u00a0...We\u2019ve used the word parallel a couple of times now and we should probably be a little careful with it.\u00a0 In general, we will think of a line and a graph as being parallel at a point if they are both moving in the same direction at that point.\u00a0 So, in the first point above the graph and the line are moving in the same direction and so we will say they are parallel at that point.\u00a0 At the second point, on the other hand, the line and the graph are not moving in the same direction and so they aren\u2019t parallel at that point....\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve gotten the definition of a tangent line out of the way let\u2019s move on to the tangent line problem.\u00a0 That\u2019s probably best done with an example. ...\u00a0...Find   the tangent line to ...\u00a0at ... =   1....\u00a0...We know from algebra that to find the equation of a line   we need either two points on the line or a single point on the line and the   slope of the line.\u00a0 Since we know that   we are after a tangent line we do have a point that is on the line.\u00a0 The tangent line and the graph of the   function must touch at ... = 1 so the   point ...\u00a0must be on the line....\u00a0...Now we reach the problem.\u00a0   This is all that we know about the tangent line.\u00a0 In order to find the tangent line we need   either a second point or the slope of the tangent line.\u00a0 Since the only reason for needing a second   point is to allow us to find the slope of the tangent line let\u2019s just   concentrate on seeing if we can determine the slope of the tangent line....\u00a0...At this point in time all that we\u2019re going to be able to   do is to get an estimate for the slope of the tangent line, but if we do it   correctly we should be able to get an estimate that is in fact the actual   slope of the tangent line.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do   this by starting with the point that we\u2019re after, let\u2019s call it ....\u00a0 We will then pick another point that lies   on the graph of the function, let\u2019s call that point .......\u00a0...For the sake of argument let\u2019s take choose ...and so the second point will be ....\u00a0 Below is a graph of the function, the   tangent line and the secant line that connects ... and ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We can see from this graph that the secant and tangent   lines are somewhat similar and so the slope of the secant line should be   somewhat close to the actual slope of the tangent line.\u00a0 So, as an estimate of the slope of the   tangent line we can use the slope of the secant line, let\u2019s call it ...,   which is,...\u00a0...Now, if we weren\u2019t too interested in accuracy we could say   this is good enough and use this as an estimate of the slope of the tangent   line.\u00a0 However, we would like an   estimate that is at least somewhat close the actual value.\u00a0 So, to get a better estimate we can take an   ... that is closer to ...\u00a0and redo the work above to get a new   estimate on the slope.\u00a0 We could then   take a third value of ... even closer   yet and get an even better estimate....\u00a0...In other words, as we take ... closer and closer to ...   the slope of the secant line connecting ...   and ... should be getting closer and   closer to the slope of the tangent line.\u00a0   If you are viewing this on the web, the image below shows this   process....\u00a0...As you can see (if you\u2019re reading this on the web) as we   moved ... in closer and closer to ... the secant lines does start to look   more and more like the tangent line and so the approximate slopes (... the slopes of the secant lines)   are getting closer and closer to the exact slope.\u00a0 Also, do not worry about how I got the   exact or approximate slopes.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be   computing the approximate slopes shortly and we\u2019ll be able to compute the   exact slope in a few sections....\u00a0...In this figure we only looked at ...\u2019s that were to the right of ..., but we could have just as easily used ...\u2019s that were to the left of ... and we would have received the same   results.\u00a0 In fact, we should always   take a look at ...\u2019s that are on both   sides of ....\u00a0 In this case the same thing is happening on   both sides of ....\u00a0 However, we will eventually see that   doesn\u2019t have to happen.\u00a0 Therefore we   should always take a look at what is happening on both sides of the point in   question when doing this kind of process....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s see if we can come up with the approximate   slopes I showed above, and hence an estimation of the slope of the tangent   line.\u00a0 In order to simplify the process   a little let\u2019s get a formula for the slope of the line between ... and ..., ...,   that will work for any ... that we   choose to work with.\u00a0 We can get a   formula by finding the slope between ...   and ... using the \u201cgeneral\u201d form of .......\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s pick some values of ...,   plug in and get some slopes....2...-6...0...-2...1.5...0.5...-3...1.1...-4.2...0.9...-3.8...1.01...-4.02...0.99...-3.98...1.001...-4.002...0.999...-3.998...1.0001...-4.0002...0.9999...-3.9998...So, if we take ...\u2019s to   the right of 1 and move them in very close to 1 it appears that the slope of   the secant lines appears to be approaching -4.\u00a0 Likewise, if we take ...\u2019s to the left of 1 and move them in very   close to 1 the slope of the secant lines again appears to be approaching -4....\u00a0...Based on this evidence it seems that the slopes of the   secant lines are approaching -4 as we move in towards ...,   so we will estimate that the slope of the tangent line is also -4.\u00a0 As noted above, this is the correct value   and we will be able to prove this eventually....\u00a0...Now, the equation of the line that goes through ...\u00a0is given by...\u00a0\u00a0 ...Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to ...\u00a0at ... = 1   is...\u00a0...There are a couple of important points to note about our work above.\u00a0 First, we looked at points that were on both sides of ....\u00a0 In this kind of process it is important to never assume that what is happening on one side of a point will also be happening on the other side as well.\u00a0 We should always look at what is happening on both sides of the point.\u00a0 In this example we could sketch a graph and from that guess that what is happening on one side will also be happening on the other, but we will usually not have the graphs in front of us or be able to easily get them....\u00a0...Next, notice that when we say we\u2019re going to move in close to the point in question we do mean that we\u2019re going to move in very close and we also used more than just a couple of points.\u00a0 We should never try to determine a trend based on a couple of points that aren\u2019t really all that close to the point in question....\u00a0...The next thing to notice is really a warning more than anything.\u00a0 The values of ...\u00a0in this example were fairly \u201cnice\u201d and it was pretty clear what value they were approaching after a couple of computations.\u00a0 In most cases this will not be the case.\u00a0 Most values will be far \u201cmessier\u201d and you\u2019ll often need quite a few computations to be able to get an estimate....\u00a0...Last, we were after something that was happening at ...and we couldn\u2019t actually plug ...\u00a0into our formula for the slope.\u00a0 Despite this limitation we were able to determine some information about what was happening at ...\u00a0simply by looking at what was happening around ....\u00a0 This is more important than you might at first realize and we will be discussing this point in detail in later sections....\u00a0...Before moving on let\u2019s do a quick review of just what we did in the above example.\u00a0 We wanted the tangent line to ...\u00a0at a point ....\u00a0 First, we know that the point ...\u00a0will be on the tangent line.\u00a0 Next, we\u2019ll take a second point that is on the graph of the function, call it ...\u00a0and compute the slope of the line connecting ... and ... as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We then take values of ... that get closer and closer to ...\u00a0(making sure to look at ...\u2019s on both sides of ...\u00a0and use this list of values to estimate the slope of the tangent line, ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The tangent line will then be,...\u00a0...The next problem that we need to look at is the rate of change problem.\u00a0 This will turn out to be one of the most important concepts that we will look at throughout this course....\u00a0...Here we are going to consider a function, ..., that represents some quantity that varies as ... varies.\u00a0 For instance, maybe ... represents the amount of water in a holding tank after ... minutes.\u00a0 Or maybe ... is the distance traveled by a car after ... hours.\u00a0 In both of these example we used ... to represent time.\u00a0 Of course ... doesn\u2019t have to represent time, but it makes for examples that are easy to visualize....\u00a0...What we want to do here is determine just how fast ... is changing at some point, say ....\u00a0 This is called the ... or sometimes just ... of ... at ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with the tangent line problem all that we\u2019re going to be able to do at this point is to estimate the rate of change.\u00a0 So let\u2019s continue with the examples above and think of ... as something that is changing in time and ... being the time measurement.\u00a0 Again ... doesn\u2019t have to represent time but it will make the explanation a little easier.\u00a0 While we can\u2019t compute the instantaneous rate of change at this point we can find the average rate of change....\u00a0...To compute the average rate of change of ... at ...\u00a0all we need to do is to choose another point, say ..., and then the average rate of change will be,...\u00a0...Then to estimate the instantaneous rate of change at ...all we need to do is to choose values of ... getting closer and closer to ...\u00a0(don\u2019t forget to chose them on both sides of ...) and compute values of ...\u00a0 We can then estimate the instantaneous rate of change from that....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example....\u00a0...Suppose   that the amount of air in a balloon after ...   hours is given by ...Estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the volume   after 5 hours....\u00a0...Okay.\u00a0 The first   thing that we need to do is get a formula for the average rate of change of   the volume.\u00a0 In this case this is,...\u00a0...To estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the volume   at ...\u00a0we just need to pick values of ... that are getting closer and closer   to ....\u00a0 Here is a table of values of ... and the average rate of change for   those values....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, from this table it looks like the average rate of   change is approaching 15 and so we can estimate that the instantaneous rate   of change is 15 at this point....\u00a0...So, just what does this tell us about the volume at this point?\u00a0 Let\u2019s put some units on the answer from above.\u00a0 This might help us to see what is happening to the volume at this point.\u00a0 Let\u2019s suppose that the units on the volume were in cm....\u00a0 The units on the rate of change (both average and instantaneous) are then cm.../hr.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We have estimated that at ...\u00a0the volume is changing at a rate of 15 cm.../hr.\u00a0 This means that at ...\u00a0the volume is changing in such a way that, if the rate were constant, then an hour later there would be 15 cm... more air in the balloon than there was at ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We do need to be careful here however.\u00a0 In reality there probably won\u2019t be 15 cm... more air in the balloon after an hour.\u00a0 The rate at which the volume is changing is generally not constant and so we can\u2019t make any real determination as to what the volume will be in another hour.\u00a0 What we can say is that the volume is increasing, since the instantaneous rate of change is positive, and if we had rates of change for other values of ... we could compare the numbers and see if the rate of change is faster or slower at the other points....\u00a0...For instance, at ...\u00a0the instantaneous rate of change is 0 cm.../hr and at ...\u00a0the instantaneous rate of change is -9 cm.../hr.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave it to you to check these rates of change.\u00a0 In fact, that would be a good exercise to see if you can build a table of values that will support my claims on these rates of change....\u00a0...Anyway, back to the example.\u00a0 At ...\u00a0the rate of change is zero and so at this point in time the volume is not changing at all.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that it will not change in the future.\u00a0 It just means that exactly at ...\u00a0the volume isn\u2019t changing.\u00a0 Likewise at ...\u00a0the volume is decreasing since the rate of change at that point is negative.\u00a0 We can also say that, regardless of the increasing/decreasing aspects of the rate of change, the volume of the balloon is changing faster at ...\u00a0than it is at ...\u00a0since 15 is larger than 9....\u00a0...We will be talking a lot more about rates of change when we get into the next chapter....\u00a0...Let\u2019s briefly look at the velocity problem.\u00a0 Many calculus books will treat this as its own problem.\u00a0 I however, like to think of this as a special case of the rate of change problem.\u00a0 In the velocity problem we are given a position function of an object, ..., that gives the position of an object at time ....\u00a0 Then to compute the instantaneous velocity of the object we just need to recall that the velocity is nothing more than the rate at which the position is changing....\u00a0...In other words, to estimate the instantaneous velocity we would first compute the average velocity,...\u00a0...and then take values of ... closer and closer to ...\u00a0and use these values to estimate the instantaneous velocity....\u00a0...There is one last thing that we need to do in this section before we move on.\u00a0 The main point of this section was to introduce us to a couple of key concepts and ideas that we will see throughout the first portion of this course as well as get us started down the path towards limits....\u00a0...Before we move into limits officially let\u2019s go back and do a little work that will relate both (or all three if you include velocity as a separate problem) problems to a more general concept....\u00a0...First, notice that whether we wanted the tangent line, instantaneous rate of change, or instantaneous velocity each of these came down to using exactly the same formula.\u00a0 Namely,...\u00a0...This should suggest that all three of these problems are then really the same problem.\u00a0 In fact this is the case as we will see in the next chapter.\u00a0 We are really working the same problem in each of these cases the only difference is the interpretation of the results.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In preparation for the next section where we will discuss this in much more detail we need to do a quick change of notation.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier to do here since we\u2019ve already invested a fair amount of time into these problems....\u00a0...In all of these problems we wanted to determine what was happening at ....\u00a0 To do this we chose another value of ... and plugged into ....\u00a0 For what we were doing here that is probably most intuitive way of doing it.\u00a0 However, when we start looking at these problems as a single problem ... will not be the best formula to work with....\u00a0...What we\u2019ll do instead is to first determine how far from ...\u00a0we want to move and then define our new point based on that decision.\u00a0 So, if we want to move a distance of ... from ...\u00a0the new point would be ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As we saw in our work above it is important to take values of ... that are both sides of .... This way of choosing new value of ... will do this for us.\u00a0 If ... we will get value of ... that are to the right of ...\u00a0and if ... we will get values of ... that are to the left of .......\u00a0...Now, with this new way of getting a second ... ... will become,...\u00a0...\u00a0...On the surface it might seem that ... is going to be an overly complicated way of dealing with this stuff.\u00a0 However, as we will see it will often be easier to deal with ... than it will be to deal with ....", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Tangents_Rates.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Tangent Lines and Rates of Change", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the final two examples in the previous ... we saw two limits that did not exist.\u00a0 However, the reason for each of the limits not existing

part of the limit.\u00a0 For the right-handed limit we now have ...(note the \u201c+\u201d) which means that we know will only look at ....\u00a0 Likewise for the left-handed limit we have ...(note the \u201c-\u201d) which means that we will only be looking at .......\u00a0...Also, note that as with the \u201cnormal\u201d limit (... the limits from the previous section) we still need the function to settle down to a single number in order for the limit to exist.\u00a0 The only difference this time is that the function only needs to settle down to a single number on either the right side of ...\u00a0or the left side of ...\u00a0depending on the one-sided limit we\u2019re dealing with....\u00a0...So when we are looking at limits it\u2019s now important to pay very close attention to see whether we are doing a normal limit or one of the one-sided limits.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now take a look at the some of the problems from the last section and look at one-sided limits instead of the normal limit....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limits....\u00a0...To remind us what this function looks like here\u2019s the   graph....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we can see that if we stay to the right of ...\u00a0(...   ...) then the function is moving in   towards a value of 1 as we get closer and closer to ...,   but staying to the right.\u00a0 We can   therefore say that the right-handed limit is,...Likewise, if we stay to the left of ...\u00a0(...)   the function is moving in towards a value of 0 as we get closer and closer to   ...,   but staying to the left.\u00a0 Therefore the   left-handed limit is,...\u00a0...In this example we do get one-sided limits even though the   normal limit itself doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limits....\u00a0...From the graph of this function shown below,...\u00a0...\u00a0...we can see that both of the one-sided limits suffer the   same problem that the normal limit did in the previous section.\u00a0 The function does not settle down to a   single number on either side of ....\u00a0 Therefore, neither the left-handed nor the   right-handed limit will exist in this case....\u00a0...So, one-sided limits don\u2019t have to exist just as normal limits aren\u2019t guaranteed to exist....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example from the previous section....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limits....\u00a0...So as we\u2019ve done with the previous two examples, let\u2019s   remind ourselves of the graph of this function. ...\u00a0...In this case regardless of which side of ...\u00a0we are on the function is always approaching   a value of 4 and so we get,...\u00a0...Note that one-sided limits do not care about what\u2019s happening at the point any more than normal limits do.\u00a0 They are still only concerned with what is going on around the point.\u00a0 The only real difference between one-sided limits and normal limits is the range of ...\u2019s that we look at when determining the value of the limit....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at the first and last example in this section to get a very nice fact about the relationship between one-sided limits and normal limits.\u00a0 In the last example the one-sided limits as well as the normal limit existed and all three had a value of 4.\u00a0 In the first example the two one-sided limits both existed, but did not have the same value and the normal limit did not exist.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The relationship between one-sided limits and normal limits can be summarized by the following fact....\u00a0...Given a function ...   if,...then the normal limit will exist and ...Likewise, if...then,...\u00a0...This fact can be turned around to also say that if the two one-sided limits have different values, ...,...then the normal limit will not exist.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This should make some sense.\u00a0 If the normal limit did exist then by the fact the two one-sided limits would have to exist and have the same value by the above fact.\u00a0 So, if the two one-sided limits have different values (or don\u2019t even exist) then the normal limit simply can\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at one more example to make sure that we\u2019ve got all the ideas about limits down that we\u2019ve looked at in the last couple of sections....\u00a0...Given   the following graph,...compute each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0 ...

of 2 as   ... moves in towards -4 from the   left....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0The function is approaching a value of 2 as   ... moves in towards -4 from the   right.... ...\u00a0\u00a0We can do this one of two ways.\u00a0 Either we can use the fact here and notice   that the two one-sided limits are the same and so the normal limit must exist   and have the same value as the one-sided limits or just get the answer from   the graph.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also recall that a limit can exist at a point even if the   function doesn\u2019t exist at that point....\u00a0... ....\u00a0 The function will take on the ... value where the closed dot is....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0The function is approaching a value of 4 as   ... moves in towards 1 from the left....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0The function is approaching a value of -2   as ... moves in towards 1 from the   right.\u00a0 Remember that the limit does   NOT care about what the function is actually doing at the point, it only   cares about what the function is doing around the point.\u00a0 In this case, always staying to the right   of ...,   the function is approaching a value of -2 and so the limit is -2.\u00a0 The limit is not 4, as that is value of the   function at the point and again the limit doesn\u2019t care about that!...\u00a0... ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 The two one-sided limits both exist,   however they are different and so the normal limit doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0... ....\u00a0 The function will take on the ... value where the closed dot is....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0The function is approaching a value of 5 as   ... moves in towards 6 from the left....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0The function is approaching a value of 5 as   ... moves in towards 6 from the   right....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0Again, we can use either the graph or the   fact to get this.\u00a0 Also, once more   remember that the limit doesn\u2019t care what is happening at the point and so   it\u2019s possible for the limit to have a different value than the function at a   point.\u00a0 When dealing with limits we\u2019ve   always got to remember that limits simply do not care about what the function   is doing at the point in question.\u00a0   Limits are only concerned with what the function is doing around the   point....\u00a0...Hopefully over the last couple of sections you\u2019ve gotten an idea on how limits work and what they can tell us about functions.\u00a0 Some of these ideas will be important in later sections so it\u2019s important that you have a good grasp on them.",

to the equation....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a look at a more complicated equation.\u00a0 Often there will be more than one logarithm in the equation.\u00a0 When this happens we will need to use on or more of the following properties to combine all the logarithms into a single logarithm.\u00a0 Once this has been done we can proceed as we did in the previous example....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...First get the two logarithms combined into a single   logarithm....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Now, exponentiate both sides and solve for .......\u00a0...Finally, we just need to make sure that the solution, ...,   doesn\u2019t produce negative numbers in both of the original logarithms.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t, so this is in fact our   solution to this problem....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at one more example....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...As with the last example, first combine the logarithms   into a single logarithm....Now exponentiate, using 10 this time instead of ... because we\u2019ve got common logs in   the equation, both sides....\u00a0...So, potential solutions are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Note, however that if we plug ...\u00a0into either of the two original logarithms   we would get negative numbers so this can\u2019t be a solution.\u00a0 We can however, use .......\u00a0...Therefore, the solution to this equation is .......\u00a0...When solving equations with logarithms it is important to check your potential solutions to make sure that they don\u2019t generate logarithms of negative numbers or zero.\u00a0 It is also important to make sure that you do the checks in the ... equation.\u00a0 If you check them in the second logarithm above (after we\u2019ve combined the two logs) both solutions will appear to work!\u00a0 This is because in combining the two logarithms we\u2019ve actually changed the problem.\u00a0 In fact, it is this change that introduces the extra solution that we couldn\u2019t use!...\u00a0...Also be careful in solving equations containing logarithms to not get locked into the idea that you will get two potential solutions and only one of these will work.\u00a0 It is possible to have problems where both are solutions and where neither are solutions.", "url":

(or ...) that we are moving in towards....\u00a0...In this section we are going to take an intuitive approach to limits and try to get a feel for what they are and what they can tell us about a function.\u00a0 With that goal in mind we are not going to get into how we actually compute limits yet.\u00a0 We will instead rely on what we did in the previous section as well as another approach to guess the value of the limits....\u00a0...Both of the approaches that we are going to use in this section are designed to help us understand just what limits are.\u00a0 In general we don\u2019t typically use the methods in this section to compute limits and in many cases can be very difficult to use to even estimate the value of a limit and/or will give the wrong value on occasion.\u00a0 We will look at actually computing limits in a couple of sections....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first start off with the following \u201cdefinition\u201d of a limit....\u00a0...We say that the limit of ... is ... as ... approaches ... and write this as...provided we can make ...   as close to ... as we want for all ... sufficiently close to ..., from both sides, without actually   letting ... be .......\u00a0...This is not the exact, precise definition of a limit.\u00a0 If you would like to see the more precise and mathematical definition of a limit you should check out the ... section at the end of this chapter.\u00a0 The definition given above is more of a \u201cworking\u201d definition.\u00a0 This definition helps us to get an idea of just what limits are and what they can tell us about functions....\u00a0...So just what does this definition mean?\u00a0 Well let\u2019s suppose that we know that the limit does in fact exist.\u00a0 According to our \u201cworking\u201d definition we can then decide how close to ... that we\u2019d like to make ....\u00a0 For sake of argument let\u2019s suppose that we want to make ... no more that 0.001 away from ....\u00a0 This means that we want one of the following...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now according to the \u201cworking\u201d definition this means that if we get ... sufficiently close to ... we can make one of the above true.\u00a0 However, it actually says a little more.\u00a0 It actually says that somewhere out there in the world is a value of ..., say ..., so that for all ... that are closer to ... than ... then one of the above statements will be true.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is actually a fairly important idea.\u00a0 There are many functions out there in the world that we can make as close to ... for specific values of ... that are close to ..., but there will be other values of ... closer to ... that give functions values that are nowhere near close to ....\u00a0 In order for a limit to exist once we get ... as close to ... as we want for some ... then it will need to stay in that close to ... (or get closer) for all values of ... that are closer to ....\u00a0 We\u2019ll see an ... of this later in this section....\u00a0...In somewhat simpler terms the definition says that as ... gets closer and closer to ... (from both sides of course\u2026) then ... ... be getting closer and closer to ....\u00a0 Or, as we move in towards ... then ... ... be moving in towards .......\u00a0...It is important to note once again that we must look at values of ... that are on both sides of ....\u00a0 We should also note that we are not allowed to use ... in the definition.\u00a0 We will often use the information that limits give us to get some information about what is going on right at ..., but the limit itself is not concerned with what is actually going on at ....\u00a0 The limit is only concerned with what is going on around the point ....\u00a0 This is an important concept about limits that we need to keep in mind....\u00a0...An alternative notation that we will occasionally use in denoting limits is...\u00a0...How do we use this definition to help us estimate limits?\u00a0 We do exactly what we did in the previous ....\u00a0 We take ... on both sides of ... that move in closer and closer to ... and we plug these into our function.\u00a0 We then look to see if we can determine what number the function values are moving in towards and use this as our estimate....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work an example....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limit....Notice that I did say estimate the value of the   limit.\u00a0 Again, we are not going to   directly compute limits in this section.\u00a0   The point of this section is to give us a better idea of how limits   work and what they can tell us about the function....\u00a0...So, with that in mind we are going to work this in pretty   much the same way that we did in the last section.\u00a0 We will choose values of ... that get closer and closer to ... and plug these values into the   function.\u00a0 Doing this gives the   following table of values....\u00a0...Let\u2019s think a little bit more about what\u2019s going on here.\u00a0 Let\u2019s graph the function from the last example.\u00a0 The graph of the function in the range of ...\u2019s that were interested in is shown below....\u00a0...First, notice that there is a rather large open dot at ....\u00a0 This is there to remind us that the function (and hence the graph) doesn\u2019t exist at .......As we were plugging in values of ... into the function we are in effect moving along the graph in towards the point as ....\u00a0 This is shown in the graph by the two arrows on the graph that are moving in towards the point....When we are computing limits the question that we are really asking is what ... value is our graph approaching as we move in towards ...\u00a0on our graph.\u00a0 We are ... asking what ... value the graph takes at the point in question.\u00a0 In other words, we are asking what the graph is doing ... the point ....\u00a0 In our case we can see that as ... moves in towards 2 (from both sides) the function is approaching ...\u00a0even though the function itself doesn\u2019t even exist at ....\u00a0 Therefore we can say that the limit is in fact 4....So what have we learned about limits?\u00a0 Limits are asking what the function is doing ... ...\u00a0and are ... concerned with what the function is actually doing at ....\u00a0 This is a good thing as many of the functions that we\u2019ll be looking at won\u2019t even exist at ...\u00a0as we saw in our last example....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another example to drive this point home....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limit....The first thing to note here is that this is exactly the   same function as the first example with the exception that we\u2019ve now given it   a value for ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s first note that...\u00a0...As far as estimating the value of this limit goes, nothing   has changed in comparison to the first example.\u00a0 We could build up a table of values as we   did in the first example or we could take a quick look at the graph of the   function.\u00a0 Either method will give us   the value of the limit....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first take a look at a table of values and see what   that tells us.\u00a0 Notice that the   presence of the value for the function at ...\u00a0will not change our choices for ....\u00a0   We only choose values of ...   that are getting closer to ...\u00a0but we never take ....\u00a0 In other words the table of values that we   used in the first example will be exactly the same table that we\u2019ll use   here.\u00a0 So, since we\u2019ve already got it   down once there is no reason to redo it here....\u00a0...From this table it is again clear that the limit is,...\u00a0...The limit is ...   6!\u00a0 Remember from the discussion after   the first example that limits do not care what the function is actually doing   at the point in question.\u00a0 Limits are   only concerned with what is going on ...   the point.\u00a0 Since the only thing about   the function that we actually changed was its behavior at ...\u00a0this will not change the limit....\u00a0...Let\u2019s also take a quick look at this function's graph to   see if this says the same thing....\u00a0...Again, we can see that as we move in towards ...\u00a0on our graph the function is still   approaching a ... value of 4.\u00a0 Remember that we are only asking what the   function is doing ... ...\u00a0and we don\u2019t care what the function is   actually doing at ....\u00a0 The graph then also supports the conclusion   that the limit is,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s make the point one more time just to make sure we\u2019ve got it.\u00a0 Limits are ... concerned with what is going on at .... Limits are only concerned with what is going on ... ....\u00a0 We keep saying this, but it is a very important concept about limits that we must always keep in mind.\u00a0 So, we will take every opportunity to remind ourselves of this idea....\u00a0...Since limits aren\u2019t concerned with what is actually happening at ...\u00a0we will, on occasion, see situations like the previous example where the limit at a point and the function value at a point are different.\u00a0 This won\u2019t always happen of course.\u00a0 There are times where the function value and the limit at a point are the same and we will eventually see some examples of those.\u00a0 It is important however, to not get excited about things when the function and the limit do not take the same value at a point.\u00a0 It happens sometimes and so we will need to be able to deal with those cases when they arise....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look another example to try and beat this idea into the ground....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limit....\u00a0...First don\u2019t get excited about the ...\u00a0in function.\u00a0   It\u2019s just a letter, just like ...   is a letter!\u00a0 It\u2019s a Greek letter, but   it\u2019s a letter and you will be asked to deal with Greek letters on occasion so   it\u2019s a good idea to start getting used to them at this point....\u00a0...Now, also notice that if we plug in ... that we will get division by   zero and so the function doesn\u2019t exist at this point.\u00a0 Actually, we get 0/0 at this point, but   because of the division by zero this function does not exist at .... ...\u00a0...So, as we did in the first example let\u2019s get a table of   values and see what if we can guess what value the function is heading in   towards....\u00a0...1...0.45969769...-1...-0.45969769...0.1...0.04995835...-0.1...-0.04995835...0.01...0.00499996...-0.01...-0.00499996...0.001...0.00049999...-0.001...-0.00049999...\u00a0...Okay, it looks like the function is moving in towards a   value of zero as ...\u00a0moves in towards 0, from both sides of   course....\u00a0...Therefore, the we will guess that the limit has the value,...\u00a0...So, once again, the limit had a value even though the function didn\u2019t exist at the point we were interested in....\u00a0...It\u2019s now time to work a couple of more examples that will lead us into the next idea about limits that we\u2019re going to want to discuss....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limit....Let\u2019s build up a table of values and see what\u2019s going on   with our function in this case. ...\u00a0...1...-1...-1...-1...0.1...1...-0.1...1...0.01...1...-0.01...1...0.001...1...-0.001...1...\u00a0...Now, if we were to guess the limit from this table we   would guess that the limit is 1.\u00a0   However, if we did make this guess we would be wrong.\u00a0 Consider any of the following function   evaluations....In all three of these function evaluations we evaluated   the function at a number that is less that 0.001 and got three totally   different numbers.\u00a0 Recall that the   definition of the limit that we\u2019re working with requires that the function be   approaching a single value (our guess) as ...   gets closer and closer to the point in question.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t say that only some of the   function values must be getting closer to the guess.\u00a0 It says that all the function values must   be getting closer and closer to our guess....\u00a0...To see what\u2019s happening here a graph of the function would   be convenient.\u00a0 ...From this graph we can see that as we move in towards ...\u00a0the function starts oscillating wildly and   in fact the oscillations increases in speed the closer to ...\u00a0that we get.\u00a0   Recall from our definition of the limit that in order for a limit to   exist the function must be settling down in towards a single value as we get   closer to the point in question....\u00a0...This function clearly does not settle in towards a single   number and so this limit ...!...\u00a0...This last example points out the drawback of just picking values of ... using a table of function values to estimate the value of a limit.\u00a0 The values of ... that we chose in the previous example were valid and in fact were probably values that many would have picked.\u00a0 In fact they were exactly the same values we used in the problem before this one and they worked in that problem!...\u00a0...When using a table of values there will always be the possibility that we aren\u2019t choosing the correct values and that we will guess incorrectly for our limit.\u00a0 This is something that we should always keep in mind when doing this to guess the value of limits.\u00a0 In fact, this is such a problem that after this section we will never use a table of values to guess the value of a limit again....\u00a0...This last example also has shown us that limits do not have to exist.\u00a0 To this point we\u2019ve only seen limits that have existed, but that just doesn\u2019t always have to be the case....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at one more example in this section....\u00a0...Estimate   the value of the following limit....This function is often called either the ... or ... function.\u00a0 We could   use a table of values to estimate the limit, but it\u2019s probably just as quick   in this case to use the graph so let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 Below is the graph of this function....\u00a0...We can see from the graph that if we approach ...\u00a0from the right side the function is moving   in towards a ... value of 1.\u00a0 Well actually it\u2019s just staying at 1, but   in the terminology that we\u2019ve been using in this section it\u2019s moving in   towards 1\u2026...\u00a0...Also, if we move in towards ...\u00a0from the left the function is moving in   towards a ... value of 0....\u00a0...According to our definition of the limit the function   needs to move in towards a single value as we move in towards ...\u00a0(from both sides).\u00a0 This isn\u2019t happening in this case and so in   this example we will also say that the limit doesn\u2019t exist....\u00a0...Note that the limit in this example is a little different   from the previous example.\u00a0 In the   previous example the function did not settle down to a single number as we   moved in towards ....\u00a0 In this example however, the function does   settle down to a single number as ...\u00a0on either side.\u00a0 The problem is that the number is different   on each side of ....\u00a0 This is an idea that we\u2019ll look at in a   little more detail in the next section....\u00a0...Let\u2019s summarize what we (hopefully) learned in this section.\u00a0 In the first three examples we saw that limits do not care what the function is actually doing at the point in question.\u00a0 They only are concerned with what is happening around the point.\u00a0 In fact, we can have limits at ...\u00a0even if the function itself does not exist at that point.\u00a0 Likewise, even if a function exists at a point there is no reason (at this point) to think that the limit will have the same value as the function at that point.\u00a0 Sometimes the limit and the function will have the same value at a point and other times they won\u2019t have the same value....\u00a0...Next, in the third and fourth examples we saw the main reason for not using a table of values to guess the value of a limit.\u00a0 In those examples we used exactly the same set of values, however they only worked in one of the examples.\u00a0 Using tables of values to guess the value of limits is simply not a good way to get the value of a limit.\u00a0 This is the only section in which we will do this.\u00a0 Tables of values should always be your last choice in finding values of limits....\u00a0...The last two examples showed us that not all limits will in fact exist.\u00a0 We should not get locked into the idea that limits will always exist.\u00a0 In most calculus courses we work with limits that almost always exist and so it\u2019s easy to start thinking that limits always exist.\u00a0 Limits don\u2019t always exist and so don\u2019t get into the habit of assuming that they will....\u00a0...Finally, we saw in the fourth example that the only way to deal with the limit was to graph the function.\u00a0 Sometimes this is the only way, however this example also illustrated the drawback of using graphs.\u00a0 In order to use a graph to guess the value of the limit you need to be able to actually sketch the graph.\u00a0 For many functions this is not that easy to do.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There is another drawback in using graphs.\u00a0 Even if you actually have the graph it\u2019s only going to be useful if the ... value is approaching an integer.\u00a0 If the ... value is approaching say ...\u00a0there is no way that you\u2019re going to be able to guess that value from the graph and we are usually going to want exact values for our limits....\u00a0...So while graphs of functions can, on occasion, make your life easier in guessing values of limits they are again probably not the best way to get values of limits.\u00a0 They are only going to be useful if you can get your hands on it and the value of the limit is a \u201cnice\u201d number....\u00a0...The natural question then is why did we even talk about using tables and/or graphs to estimate limits if they aren\u2019t the best way.\u00a0 There were a couple of reasons.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, they can help us get a better understanding of what limits are and what they can tell us.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t do at least a couple of limits in this way we might not get all that good of an idea on just what limits are....\u00a0...The second reason for doing limits in this way is to point out their drawback so that we aren\u2019t tempted to use them all the time!...\u00a0...We will eventually talk about how we really do limits.\u00a0 However, there is one more topic that we need to discuss before doing that.\u00a0 Since this section has already gone on

Here is the solution....\u00a0...\u00a0...This angle is in the second quadrant and so we can use   either -2.2143 or ...\u00a0for the second angle.\u00a0 As usual for these notes we\u2019ll use the   positive one.\u00a0 Therefore the two angles   are,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we still   need to find the actual values of ...   that are the solutions.\u00a0 These are   found in the same manner as all the problems above.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first add 1 to both sides and then   divide by 2.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this example we saw an argument that was a little different from those seen previously, but not all that different when it comes to working the problems so don\u2019t get too excited about it....We now need to move into a different type of trig equation.\u00a0 All of the trig equations solved to this point (the previous example as well as the previous section) were, in some way, more or less the \u201cstandard\u201d trig equation that is usually solved in a trig class.\u00a0 There are other types of equations involving trig functions however that we need to take a quick look at.\u00a0 The remaining examples show some of these different kinds of trig equations....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...So, this definitely doesn\u2019t look like any of the equations   we\u2019ve solved to this point and initially the process is different as   well.\u00a0 First, notice that there is a ...\u00a0in each term, so let\u2019s factor that out and   see what we have....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We now have a   product of two terms that is zero and so we know that we must have,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, at this   point we have two trig equations to solve and each is identical to the type   of equation we were solving earlier.\u00a0   Because of this we won\u2019t put in much detail about solving these two   equations....\u00a0...First, solving ...\u00a0gives,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, solving ...gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Remember that   in these notes we tend to take positive angles and so the first solution here   is in fact ...\u00a0where our calculator gave us -0.2762 as the   answer when using the inverse sine function....\u00a0...The solutions to this equation are then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This next example also involves \u201cfactoring\u201d trig equations but in a slightly different manner than the previous example....\u00a0...Solve   .......Before solving this equation let\u2019s solve an apparently   unrelated equation....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...This is an easy   (or at least I hope it\u2019s easy as this point) equation to solve.\u00a0 The obvious question then is, why did we do   this?\u00a0 We\u2019ll, if you compare the two   equations you\u2019ll see that the only real difference is that the one we just   solved has an ... everywhere and the   equation we want to solve has a sine.\u00a0   What this tells us is that we can work the two equations in exactly   the same way.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We, will first   \u201cfactor\u201d the equation as follows,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, set each   of the two factors equal to zero and solve for the sine,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We now have two trig equations that we can easily   (hopefully\u2026) solve at this point.\u00a0   We\u2019ll leave the details to you to verify that the solutions to each of   these and hence the solutions to the original equation are,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...The first two   solutions are from the first equation and the third solution is from the   second equation....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one more trig equation that involves solving a quadratic equation.\u00a0 However, this time, unlike the previous example this one won\u2019t factor and so we\u2019ll need to use the quadratic formula....\u00a0...Solve   .......Now, as mentioned prior to starting the example this   quadratic does not factor.\u00a0 However,   that doesn\u2019t mean all is lost.\u00a0 We can   solve the following equation with the quadratic formula (you do ...   this and how to use it right?),...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, if we can   use the quadratic formula on this then we can also use it on the equation   we\u2019re asked to solve.\u00a0 Doing this gives   us,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, recall ... from the   previous section.\u00a0 In that example we   noted that ...\u00a0and so the second equation will have no   solutions.\u00a0 Therefore, the solutions to   the first equation will yield the only solutions to our original   equation.\u00a0 Solving this gives the   following set of solutions,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that we did get some negative numbers here and that   does seem to violate the general form that we\u2019ve been using in most of these   examples.\u00a0 However, in this case the   \u201c-\u201d are coming about when we solved for ...   after computing the inverse cosine in our calculator....\u00a0...There is one more example in this section that we need to work that illustrates another way in which factoring can arise in solving trig equations.\u00a0 This equation is also the only one where the variable appears both inside and outside of the trig equation.\u00a0 Not all equations in this form can be easily solved, however some can so we want to do a quick example of one....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...First, before we even start solving we need to make one   thing clear.\u00a0 ...\u00a0 While this may seem   like a natural thing to do it ...   cause us to lose a solution here....\u00a0...So, to solve this equation we\u2019ll first get all the terms   on one side of the equation and then factor an ... out of the equation.\u00a0 If   we can cancel an ... from all terms   then it can be factored out.\u00a0 Doing   this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Upon factoring   we can see that we must have either,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that if   we\u2019d canceled the ... we would have   missed the first solution.\u00a0 Now, we   solved an equation with a tangent in it in ... of the   previous section so we\u2019ll not go into the details of this solution here.\u00a0 Here is the solution to the trig equation....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The complete set of solutions then to the original   equation

look at logarithms in this section.\u00a0 Logarithms are one of the functions that students fear the most.\u00a0 The main reason for this seems to be that they simply have never really had to work with them.\u00a0 Once they start working with them, students come to realize that they aren\u2019t as bad as they first thought....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start with ..., ...\u00a0just as we did in the last section.\u00a0 Then we have...The first is called logarithmic form and the second is called the exponential form.\u00a0 Remembering this equivalence is the key to evaluating logarithms.\u00a0 The

exponential form.\u00a0   So, let\u2019s take a look at the first one.... ...First, let\u2019s convert to exponential form....So, we\u2019re really asking 2 raised to what gives 16.\u00a0 Since 2 raised to 4 is 16 we get,...\u00a0...We\u2019ll not do the remaining parts in quite this detail, but   they were all worked in this way....\u00a0...Note the difference between the first and second logarithm!\u00a0 The base is important!\u00a0 It can completely change the answer....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...There are a couple of special logarithms that arise in many places.\u00a0 These are,...\u00a0...In the natural logarithm the base ... is the same number as in the natural exponential logarithm that we saw in the last ....\u00a0 Here is a sketch of both of these logarithms....\u00a0...\u00a0...From this graph we can get a couple of very nice properties about the natural logarithm that we will use many times in this and later Calculus courses....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of more logarithm evaluations.\u00a0 Some of which deal with the natural or common logarithm and some of which don\u2019t....\u00a0...Without   a calculator give the exact value of each of the following logarithms....These work exactly the same as previous example so we   won\u2019t put in too many details.... ... ...\u00a0...This last set of examples leads us to some of the basic properties of logarithms....\u00a0...\u00a0...The last two properties will be especially useful in the next ....\u00a0 Notice as well that these last two properties tell us that,...are... of each other....\u00a0...Here are some more properties that are useful in the manipulation of logarithms....\u00a0...Note that there is no equivalent property to the first two for sums and differences.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...Write   each of the following in terms of simpler logarithms....\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0...What the instructions really mean here is to use as many   if the properties of logarithms as we can to simplify things down as much as   we can....\u00a0...Property 6 above can be extended to products of more than   two functions.\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve used   Property 6 we can then use Property 8.... ...When using property 7 above make sure that the logarithm   that you subtract is the one that contains the denominator as its   argument.\u00a0 Also, note that that we\u2019ll   be converting the root to fractional exponents in the first step.... ...The point to this problem is mostly the correct use of   property 8 above....You can use Property 8 on the second term because the   WHOLE term was raised to the 3, but in the first logarithm, only the   individual terms were squared and not the term as a whole so the 2\u2019s must   stay where they are!...\u00a0...The last topic that we need to look at in this section is the ... formula for logarithms.\u00a0 The change of base formula is,...\u00a0...This is the most general change of base formula and will convert from base ... to base ....\u00a0 However, the usual reason for using the change of base formula is to compute the value of a logarithm that is in a base that you can\u2019t easily deal with.\u00a0 Using the change of base formula means that you can write the logarithm in terms of a logarithm that you can deal with.\u00a0 The two most common change of base formulas are...In fact, often you will see one or the other listed as THE change of base formula!...\u00a0...In the first part of this section we computed the value of a few logarithms, but we could do these without the change of base formula because all the arguments could be written in terms of the base to a power.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...However, this only works because 49 can be written as a power of 7!\u00a0 We would need the change of base formula to compute .......\u00a0...\u00a0...OR...\u00a0...So, it doesn\u2019t matter which we use, we will get the same answer regardless of the logarithm that we use in the change of base formula....\u00a0...Note as well that we could use the change of base formula on ...if we wanted to as well....\u00a0...This is a lot of work however, and is probably not the best way to deal with this....\u00a0...So, in this section we saw how logarithms work and took a look at some of the properties of logarithms.\u00a0 We will run into logarithms on occasion so make sure that you can deal with them when we do run into them.", "url":

...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...These are written a little differently from what we\u2019re   used to seeing here.\u00a0 This is because   we want to match up these problems with what we\u2019ll be doing in this   section.\u00a0 Also, each of these parts has   several functions to differentiate starting with a specific function followed   by a general function.\u00a0 This again, is   to help us with some specific parts of the implicit differentiation process   that we\u2019ll be doing. ...\u00a0... ...,\u00a0 ...,\u00a0 ...With the first function here we\u2019re being asked to do the   following,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...and this is just   the chain rule.\u00a0 We differentiated the   outside function (the exponent of 5) and then multiplied that by the   derivative of the inside function (the stuff inside the parenthesis)....\u00a0...For the second   function we\u2019re going to do basically the same thing.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to need to use the chain   rule.\u00a0 The outside function is still   the exponent of 5 while the inside function this time is simply ....\u00a0 We don\u2019t have a specific function here, but   that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t at least write down the chain rule for this   function.\u00a0 Here is the derivative for   this function,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We don\u2019t   actually know what ...\u00a0is so when we do the derivative of the   inside function all we can do is write down notation for the derivative, ... ....   ...\u00a0...With the final   function here we simply replaced the ...\u00a0 in the second function with a ... since most of our work in this   section will involve ...\u2019s instead of   ...\u2019s.\u00a0 Outside of that this function is identical   to the second.\u00a0 So, the derivative is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...,\u00a0\u00a0 ...The first function to differentiate here is just a quick   chain rule problem again so here is it\u2019s derivative,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...For the second   function we didn\u2019t bother this time with using ...\u00a0and just jumped straight to ...\u00a0for the general version.\u00a0 This is still just a general version of   what we did for the first function.\u00a0   The outside function is still the sine and the inside is given by ...\u00a0and while we don\u2019t have a formula for ...\u00a0and so we can\u2019t actually take its derivative   we do have a notation for its derivative.\u00a0   Here is the derivative for this function,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...,\u00a0 ...In this part we\u2019ll just give the answers for each and   leave out the explanation that we had in the first two parts....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this set of examples we were just doing some chain rule problems where the inside function was ...\u00a0instead of a specific function.\u00a0 This kind of derivative shows up all the time in doing implicit differentiation so we need to make sure that we can do them.\u00a0 Also note that we only did this for three kinds of functions but there are many more kinds of functions that we could have used here....\u00a0...So, it\u2019s now time to do our first problem where implicit differentiation is required, unlike the first example where we could actually avoid implicit differentiation by solving for .......\u00a0...Find   ...\u00a0for the following function....Now, this is just a circle and we can solve for ... which would give,...\u00a0...Prior to starting this problem we stated that we had to do   implicit differentiation here because we couldn\u2019t just solve for ... and yet that\u2019s what we just   did.\u00a0 So, why can\u2019t we use \"normal\"   differentiation here?\u00a0 The problem is   the \u201c ...\u201d.\u00a0   With this in the \u201csolution\u201d for ...   we see that ... is in fact two   different functions.\u00a0 Which should we   use?\u00a0 Should we use both?\u00a0 We only want a single function for the   derivative and at best we have two functions here....\u00a0...So, in this example we really are going to need to do   implicit differentiation so we can avoid this.\u00a0 In this example we\u2019ll do the same thing we   did in the first example and remind ourselves that ... is really a function of ...   and write ... as ....\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve done this all we need to do is   differentiate each term with respect to .......\u00a0...As with the first example the right side is easy.\u00a0 The left side is also pretty easy since all   we need to do is take the derivative of each term and note that the second   term will be similar the part (a) of the second example.\u00a0 All we need to do for the second term is   use the chain rule....\u00a0...After taking the derivative we have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...At this point we can drop the ...\u00a0part as it was only in the problem to help   with the differentiation process.\u00a0 The   final step is to simply solve the resulting equation for .......\u00a0...Unlike the first example we can\u2019t just plug in for ... since we wouldn\u2019t know which of the   two functions to use.\u00a0 Most answers   from implicit differentiation will involve both ... and ... so don\u2019t get   excited about that when it happens....\u00a0...As always, we can\u2019t forget our interpretations of derivatives....\u00a0...Find   the equation of the tangent line to ...at the point .......\u00a0...First note that unlike all the other tangent line problems   we\u2019ve done in previous sections we need to be given both the ... and the ... values of the point.\u00a0   Notice as well that this point does lie on the graph of the circle   (you can check by plugging the points into the equation) and so it\u2019s okay to   talk about the tangent line at this point. ...\u00a0...Recall that to write down the tangent line we need is the slope of the tangent line and this is nothing more than the derivative   evaluated at the given point.\u00a0 We\u2019ve   got the derivative from the previous example so as we need to do is plug in   the given point....\u00a0...The tangent line is then....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s work some more examples.\u00a0 In the remaining examples we will no longer write ...\u00a0for ....\u00a0 This is just something that we were doing to remind ourselves that ... is really a function of ... to help with the derivatives. Seeing the ...\u00a0reminded us that we needed to do the chain rule on that portion of the problem.\u00a0 From this point on we\u2019ll leave the ...\u2019s written as ...\u2019s and in our head we\u2019ll need to remember that they really are ...\u00a0and that we\u2019ll need to do the chain rule....\u00a0...There is an easy way to remember how to do the chain rule in these problems.\u00a0 The chain rule really tells us to differentiate the function as we usually would, except we need to add on a derivative of the inside function.\u00a0 In implicit differentiation this means that every time we are differentiating a term with ... in it the inside function is the ... and we will need to add a ...\u00a0onto the term since that will be the derivative of the inside function....\u00a0...Let\u2019s see a couple of examples....\u00a0...Find   ...\u00a0for each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...First differentiate both sides with respect to ... and remember that each ... is really ...\u00a0we just aren\u2019t going to write it that way   anymore.\u00a0 This means that the first   term on the left will be a product rule.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...We differentiated these kinds of functions involving ...\u2019s to a power with the chain rule in   the ... above.\u00a0 Also, recall the discussion prior to the   start of this problem.\u00a0 When doing this   kind of chain rule problem all that we need to do is differentiate the ...\u2019s as normal and then add on a ...,   which is nothing more than the derivative of the \u201cinside function\u201d....\u00a0...Here is the differentiation of each side for this   function....\u00a0...Now all that we need to do is solve for the derivative, ....\u00a0 This is just basic solving algebra that you   are capable of doing.\u00a0 The main problem   is that it\u2019s liable to be messier than what you\u2019re used to doing.\u00a0 All we need to do is get all the terms with   ...\u00a0in them on one side and all the terms   without ...\u00a0in them on the other.\u00a0 Then factor ...\u00a0out of all the terms containing it and   divide both sides by the \u201ccoefficient\u201d of the ....\u00a0 Here is the solving work for this one,...\u00a0...The algebra in these problems can be quite messy so be   careful with that....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ve got two product rules to deal with this time.\u00a0 Here is the derivative of this function....\u00a0...Notice the derivative tacked onto the secant!\u00a0 Again, this is just a chain rule problem   similar to the second part of Example 2 above....\u00a0...Now, solve for the derivative.... ...We\u2019re going to need to be careful with this problem.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a couple chain rules that we\u2019re   going to need to deal with here that are a little different from those that   we\u2019ve dealt with prior to this problem.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...In both the exponential and the logarithm we\u2019ve got a   \u201cstandard\u201d chain rule in that there is something other than just an ... or ... inside the exponential and logarithm.\u00a0 So, this means we\u2019ll do the chain rule as   usual here and then when we do the derivative of the inside function for each   term we\u2019ll have to deal with differentiating ...\u2019s....\u00a0...Here is the derivative of this equation....\u00a0...In both of the chain rules note that the ...\u00a0didn\u2019t get tacked on until we actually   differentiated the ...\u2019s in that   term.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now we need to solve for the derivative and this is liable   to be somewhat messy.\u00a0 In order to get   the ...\u00a0on one side we\u2019ll need to multiply the   exponential through the parenthesis and break up the quotient....\u00a0...Note that to make the derivative at least look a little   nicer we converted all the fractions to negative exponents....\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve seen one application of implicit differentiation in the tangent line example above.\u00a0 However, there is another application that we will be seeing in every problem in\u00a0 the next section....\u00a0...In some cases we will have two (or more) functions all of which are functions of a third variable.\u00a0 So, we might have ...\u00a0and\u00a0 ..., for example and in these cases we will be differentiating with respect to ....\u00a0 This is just implicit differentiation like we did in the previous examples, but there is a difference however.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the previous examples we have functions involving ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s and thinking of ... as ....\u00a0 In these problems we differentiated with respect to ... and so when faced with ...\u2019s in the function we differentiated as normal and when faced with ...\u2019s we differentiated as normal except we then added a ...\u00a0onto that term because we were really doing a chain rule....\u00a0...In the new example we want to look at we\u2019re assuming that ...\u00a0and that ...\u00a0and differentiating with respect to ....\u00a0 This means that every time we are faced with an ... or a ... we\u2019ll be doing the chain rule.\u00a0 This in turn means that when we differentiate an ... we will need to add on an ...\u00a0and whenever we differentiate a ... we will add on a .......\u00a0...These new types of problems are really the same kind of problem we\u2019ve been doing in this section.\u00a0 They are just expanded out a little to include more than one function that will require a chain rule....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example of this kind of problem....\u00a0...Assume   that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and differentiate the following equation   with respect to .......So, just differentiate as normal and add on an appropriate   derivative at each step.\u00a0 Note as well   that the first term will be a product rule since both ... and ... are functions   of .......\u00a0...\u00a0...There really isn\u2019t all that much to this problem.\u00a0 Since there are two derivatives in the   problem we won\u2019t be bothering to solve for one of them.\u00a0 When we do this kind of problem in the next   section the problem will imply which one we need to solve for....\u00a0...At this point there doesn\u2019t seem be any real reason for doing this kind of problem, but as we\u2019ll see in the next section every problem that we\u2019ll be doing there will involve this kind of implicit differentiation.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ImplicitDIff.aspx", "media": "text",

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the previous section we started solving trig equations.\u00a0 The only problem with the equations we solved in there is that they pretty much all had solutions that came from a handful of \u201cstandard\u201d angles and of course there are many equations out there that simply don\u2019t.\u00a0 So, in this section we are going to take a look at some more trig equations, the majority of which will require the use of a calculator to solve (a couple won\u2019t need a calculator)....\u00a0...The fact that we are using calculators in this section does not however mean that the problems in the previous section aren\u2019t important.\u00a0 It is going to be assumed in this section that the basic ideas of solving trig equations are known and that we don\u2019t need to go back over them here.\u00a0 In particular, it is assumed that you can use a unit circle to help you find all answers to the equation (although the process here is a little different as we\u2019ll see) and it is assumed that you can find answers in a given interval.\u00a0 If you are unfamiliar with these ideas you should first go to the previous section and go over those problems....\u00a0...Before proceeding with the problems we need to go over how our calculators work so that we can get the correct answers.\u00a0 Calculators are great tools but if you don\u2019t know how they work and how to interpret their answers you can get in serious trouble....\u00a0...First, as already pointed out in previous sections, everything we are going to be doing here will be in radians so make sure that your calculator is set to radians before attempting the problems in this section.\u00a0 Also, we are going to use 4 decimal places of accuracy in the work here.\u00a0 You can use more if you want, but in this class we\u2019ll always use at least 4 decimal places of accuracy....\u00a0...Next, and somewhat more importantly, we need to understand how calculators give answers to inverse trig functions.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t cover inverse trig functions in this review, but they are just inverse functions and we have talked a little bit about inverse functions in a review ....\u00a0 The only real difference is that we are now using trig functions.\u00a0 We\u2019ll only be looking at three of them and they are:...\u00a0...\u00a0...As shown there are two different notations that are commonly used.\u00a0 In these notes we\u2019ll be using the first form since it is a little more compact.\u00a0 Most calculators these days will have buttons on them for these three so make sure that yours does as well.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We now need to deal with how calculators give answers to these.\u00a0 Let\u2019s suppose, for example, that we wanted our calculator to compute ....\u00a0 First, remember that what the calculator is actually computing is the angle, let\u2019s say ..., that we would plug into cosine to get a value of ..., or...So, in other words, when we are using our calculator to compute an inverse trig function we are really solving a simple trig equation.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Having our calculator compute ...\u00a0and hence solve ...\u00a0gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...From the previous section we know that there should in fact be an infinite number of answers to this including a second angle that is in the interval ....\u00a0 However, our calculator only gave us a single answer.\u00a0 How to determine what the other angles are will be covered in the following examples so we won\u2019t go into detail here about that.\u00a0 We did need to point out however, that the calculators will only give a single answer and that we\u2019re going to have more work to do than just plugging a number into a calculator....\u00a0...Since we know that there are supposed to be an infinite number of solutions to ...\u00a0the next question we should ask then is just how did the calculator decide to return the answer that it did?\u00a0 Why this one and not one of the others?\u00a0 Will it give the same answer every time?\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...There are rules that determine just what answer the calculator gives.\u00a0 All calculators will give answers in the following ranges....\u00a0...\u00a0...If you think back to the unit circle and recall that we think of cosine as the horizontal axis then we can see that we\u2019ll cover all possible values of cosine in the upper half of the circle and this is exactly the range given above for the inverse cosine.\u00a0 Likewise, since we think of sine as the vertical axis in the unit circle we can see that we\u2019ll cover all possible values of sine in the right half of the unit circle and that is the range given above....\u00a0...For the tangent range look back to the graph of the tangent function itself and we\u2019ll see that one branch of the tangent is covered in the range given above and so that is the range we\u2019ll use for inverse tangent.\u00a0 Note as well that we don\u2019t include the endpoints in the range for inverse tangent since tangent does not exist there.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, if we can remember these rules we will be able to determine the remaining angle in ...\u00a0that also works for each solution....\u00a0...As a final quick topic let\u2019s note that it will, on occasion, be useful to remember the decimal representations of some basic angles. So here they are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Using these we can quickly see that ...\u00a0must be in the first quadrant since 0.7227 is between 0 and 1.5708.\u00a0 This will be of great help when we go to determine the remaining angles...\u00a0...So, once again, we can\u2019t stress enough that calculators are great tools that can be of tremendous help to us, but it you don\u2019t understand how they work you will often get the answers to problems wrong....\u00a0...So, with all that out of the way let\u2019s take a look at our first problem....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0on[-8,10]....\u00a0...Okay, the first step here is identical to the problems in   the previous section.\u00a0 We first need to   isolate the cosine on one side by itself and then use our calculator to get   the first answer....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, this is the   one we were using above in the opening discussion of this section.\u00a0 At the time we mentioned that there were   infinite number of answers and that we\u2019d be seeing how to find them   later.\u00a0 Well that time is now. ...\u00a0...First, let\u2019s   take a quick look at a unit circle for this example....\u00a0...The angle that   we\u2019ve found is shown on the circle as well as the other angle that we know   should also be an answer.\u00a0 Finding this   angle here is just as easy as in the previous section.\u00a0 Since the line segment in the first   quadrant forms an angle of 0.7227 radians with the positive ...-axis then so does the line segment   in the fourth quadrant.\u00a0 This means   that we can use either -0.7227 as the second angle or ....\u00a0 Which you use depends on which you   prefer.\u00a0 We\u2019ll pretty much always use   the positive angle to avoid the possibility that we\u2019ll lose the minus sign....\u00a0...So, all   possible solutions, ignoring the interval for a second, are then,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, all we   need to do is plug in values of ...   to determine the angle that are actually in the interval.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the work for that....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the   solutions to this equation, in the given interval, are,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that we had a choice of angles to use for the second angle in the previous example.\u00a0 The choice of angles there will also affect the value(s) of ... that we\u2019ll need to use to get all the solutions.\u00a0 In the end, regardless of the angle chosen, we\u2019ll get the same list of solutions, but the value(s) of ... that give the solutions will be different depending on our choice....\u00a0...Also, in the above example we put in a little more explanation than we\u2019ll show in the remaining examples in this section to remind you how these work.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Solve   ...on [-2,5]....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s first get the inverse cosine portion of this   problem taken care of....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Don\u2019t forget   that we still need the \u201c3\u201d!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s look   at a quick unit circle for this problem.\u00a0   As we can see the angle 2.3462 radians is in the second quadrant and   the other angle that we need is in the third quadrant.\u00a0 We can find this second angle in exactly   the same way we did in the previous example.\u00a0   We can use either -2.3462 or we can use ....\u00a0 As with the previous example we\u2019ll use the   positive choice, but that is purely a matter of preference.\u00a0 You could use the negative if you wanted   to....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s now finish out the problem.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s acknowledge that the values of   3... that we need are,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we need to   properly deal with the 3, so divide that out to get all the solutions to the   trig equation....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Finally, we need to get the values in the given interval....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The solutions   to this equation, in the given interval are then,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ve done a couple of basic problems with cosines, now let\u2019s take a look at how solving equations with sines work.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0on [-20,30]...Let\u2019s first get the calculator work out of the way since   that isn\u2019t where the difference comes into play....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here\u2019s a unit   circle for this example....\u00a0...To find the second angle in this case we can notice that   the line in the first quadrant makes an angle of 0.1674 with the positive ...-axis and so the angle in the second   quadrant will then make an angle of 0.1674 with the negative ...-axis and so the angle that we\u2019re   after is then, .......\u00a0...Here\u2019s the rest of the solution for this example.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to assume from this point on   that you can do this work without much explanation....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...The solutions to this equation are then,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0on [0,1]....You should be getting pretty good at these by now, so we   won\u2019t be putting much explanation in for this one.\u00a0 Here we go....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Okay, with this   one we\u2019re going to do a little more work than with the others.\u00a0 For the first angle we could use the answer   our calculator gave us.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s   easy to lose minus signs so we\u2019ll instead use ....\u00a0 Again, there is no reason to this other   than a worry about losing the minus sign in the calculator answer.\u00a0 If you\u2019d like to use the calculator answer   you are more than welcome to.\u00a0 For the   second angle we\u2019ll note that the lines in the third and fourth quadrant make   an angle of 0.7297 with the ...-axis   and so the second angle is .......\u00a0...Here\u2019s the rest   of the work for this example....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, in this case we get a single solution of 0.7743....\u00a0...Note that in the previous example we only got a single solution.\u00a0 This happens on occasion so don\u2019t get worried about it.\u00a0 Also, note that it was the second angle that gave this solution and so if we\u2019d just relied on our calculator without worrying about other angles we would not have gotten this solution.\u00a0 Again, it can\u2019t be stressed enough that while calculators are a great tool if we don\u2019t understand how to correctly interpret/use the result we can (and often will) get the solution wrong....\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve only worked examples involving sine and cosine.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now work a couple of examples that involve other trig functions to see how they work....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0on[-10,0]....At first glance this problem seems to be at odds with the   sentence preceding the example.\u00a0   However, it really isn\u2019t.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, when we have more than one trig function in an   equation we need a way to get equations that only involve one trig   function.\u00a0 There are many ways of doing   this that depend on the type of equation we\u2019re starting with.\u00a0 In this case we can simply divide both   sides by a cosine and we\u2019ll get a single tangent in the equation.\u00a0 We can now see that this really is an   equation that doesn\u2019t involve a sine or a cosine.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started on this example....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, the unit   circle doesn\u2019t involve tangents, however we can use it to illustrate the   second angle in the range .......The angles that   we\u2019re looking for here are those whose quotient of ...\u00a0is the same.\u00a0   The second angle where we will get the same value of tangent will be   exactly opposite of the given point.\u00a0   For this angle the values of sine and cosine are the same except they   will have opposite signs.\u00a0 In the   quotient however, the difference in signs will cancel out and we\u2019ll get the   same value of tangent.\u00a0 So, the second   angle will always be the first angle plus .......\u00a0...Before getting   the second angle let\u2019s also note that, like the previous example, we\u2019ll use   the ...\u00a0for the first angle.\u00a0 Again, this is only because of a concern   about losing track of the minus sign in our calculator answer.\u00a0 We could just as easily do the work with   the original angle our calculator gave us....\u00a0...Now, this is   where is seems like we\u2019re just randomly making changes and doing things for   no reason.\u00a0 The second angle that we\u2019re   going to use is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The fact that   we used the calculator answer here seems to contradict the fact that we used   a different angle for the first above.\u00a0   The reason for doing this here is to give a second angle that is in   the range ....\u00a0 Had we used 5.7761 to find the second angle   we\u2019d get ....\u00a0 This is a perfectly acceptable answer,   however it is larger than ...\u00a0(6.2832) and the general rule of thumb is to   keep the initial angles as small as possible....\u00a0...Here are all   the solutions to the equation....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The seven   solutions to this equation are then,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note as well   that we didn\u2019t need to do the ...\u00a0and computation since we could see from the   given interval that we only wanted negative answers and these would clearly   give positive answers....\u00a0...Most calculators today can only do inverse sine, inverse cosine, and inverse tangent.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s see an example that uses one of the other trig functions....\u00a0...Solve   .......We\u2019ll start this one in exactly the same way we\u2019ve done   all the others....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now we reach   the problem.\u00a0 As noted above, most   calculators can\u2019t handle inverse secant so we\u2019re going to need a different   solution method for this one.\u00a0 To   finish the solution here we\u2019ll simply recall the definition of secant in   terms of cosine and convert this into an equation involving cosine instead   and we already know how to solve those kinds of trig equations....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we solved this equation in the second example above   so we won\u2019t redo our work here.\u00a0 The   solution is,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0We weren\u2019t given an   interval in this problem so here is nothing else to do here....\u00a0...For the remainder of the examples in this section we\u2019re not going to be finding solutions in an interval to save some space.\u00a0 If you followed the work from the first few examples in which we were given intervals you should be able to do any of the remaining examples if given an interval....\u00a0...Also, we will no longer be including sketches of unit circles in the remaining solutions.\u00a0 We are going to assume that you can use the above sketches as guides for sketching unit circles to verify our claims in the following examples....\u00a0...The next three examples don\u2019t require a calculator but are important enough or cause enough problems for students to include in this section in case you run across them and haven\u2019t seen them anywhere else....\u00a0...Solve   .......There really isn\u2019t too much to do with this problem.\u00a0 It is, however, different from all the   others done to this point.\u00a0 All the   others done to this point have had two angles in the interval ...\u00a0that were solutions to the equation.\u00a0 This only has one.\u00a0 Here is the solution to this equation....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Solve   .......Again, not much to this problem.\u00a0 Using a unit circle it isn\u2019t too hard to   see that the solutions to this equation are,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This next example has an important point that needs to be understood when solving some trig equations....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...This example is designed to remind you of certain   properties about sine and cosine.\u00a0   Recall that ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Therefore, since sine will never be greater   that 1 it definitely can\u2019t be 2.\u00a0 So ... to this   equation!...\u00a0...It is important to remember that not all trig equations   will have solutions....\u00a0...\u00a0...Because this document is also being prepared for viewing on the web we\u2019re going to split this section in two in order to keep the page size (and hence load time in a browser) to a minimum.\u00a0 In the next section we\u2019re going to take a look at some slightly more \u201ccomplicated\u201d equations.\u00a0 Although, as you\u2019ll see,

my class....\u00a0...Let\u2019s just jump into the examples and see how to solve trig equations....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...There\u2019s really not a whole lot to   do in solving this kind of trig equation.\u00a0   All we need to do is divide both sides by 2 and the go to the unit   circle....So, we are looking for all the values of ... for which cosine will have the value   of ....\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at the following unit   circle.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...From quick inspection we can see that ...\u00a0is a solution.\u00a0 However, as I have shown on the unit circle   there is another angle which will also be a solution.\u00a0 We need to determine what this angle   is.\u00a0 When we look for these angles we   typically want ... angles that   lie between 0 and ....\u00a0 This angle will not be the only possibility   of course, but by convention we typically look for angles that meet these   conditions.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To find this angle for this problem all we need to do is   use a little geometry.\u00a0 The angle in   the first quadrant makes an angle of ...\u00a0with the positive ...-axis, then so must the angle in the fourth quadrant.\u00a0 So we could use ...,   but again, it\u2019s more common to use positive angles so, we\u2019ll use .......\u00a0...We aren\u2019t done with this problem.\u00a0 As the discussion about finding the second   angle has shown there are many ways to write any given angle on the unit   circle.\u00a0 Sometimes it will be ...\u00a0that we want for the solution and sometimes   we will want both (or neither) of the listed angles.\u00a0 Therefore, since there isn\u2019t anything in   this problem (contrast this with the next problem) to tell us which is the   correct solution we will need to list ALL possible solutions.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is very easy to do.\u00a0   Recall from the previous ...   and you\u2019ll see there that I used...to represent all the possible angles that can end at the   same location on the unit circle, ...   angles that end at ....\u00a0 Remember that all this says is that we   start at ...\u00a0then rotate around in the counter-clockwise   direction (... is positive) or   clockwise direction (... is negative)   for ... complete rotations.\u00a0 The same thing can be done for the second solution....\u00a0...So, all together the complete solution to this problem is ...\u00a0...As a final thought, notice that we can get ...\u00a0by using ...\u00a0in the second solution....\u00a0...Now, in a calculus class this is not a typical trig equation that we\u2019ll be asked to solve.\u00a0 A more typical example is the next one....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0on .......\u00a0...In a calculus class we are often more interested in only   the solutions to a trig equation that fall in a certain interval.\u00a0 The first step in this kind of problem is   to first find all possible solutions.\u00a0   We did this in the first example....\u00a0...Now, to find the solutions in the interval all we need to   do is start picking values of ...,   plugging them in and getting the solutions that will fall into the interval   that we\u2019ve been given....\u00a0.......\u00a0...Now, notice that if we take any positive value of ... we will be adding on positive   multiples of ...   onto a positive quantity and this will take us past the upper bound of our   interval and so we don\u2019t need to take any positive value of .......\u00a0...However, just because we aren\u2019t going to take any positive   value of ... doesn\u2019t mean that we   shouldn\u2019t also look at negative values of .......\u00a0.......These are both greater than ...and so are solutions, but if we   subtract another ...\u00a0off (...   use ...) we will once again be outside of   the interval so we\u2019ve found all the possible solutions that lie inside the   interval .......\u00a0...So, the solutions are : .......\u00a0...So, let\u2019s see if you\u2019ve got all this down....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0on ...\u00a0...This problem is very similar to the other problems in this   section with a very important difference.\u00a0   We\u2019ll start this problem in exactly the same way.\u00a0 We first need to find all possible   solutions....So, we are looking for angles that will give ...\u00a0out of the sine function.\u00a0 Let\u2019s again go to our trusty unit circle....\u00a0...Now, there are no angles in the first quadrant for which   sine has a value of ....\u00a0 However, there are two angles in the lower   half of the unit circle for which sine will have a value of ....\u00a0 So, what are these angles?\u00a0 We\u2019ll notice ...,   so the angle in the third quadrant will be ...\u00a0below the ... ...-axis or ....\u00a0 Likewise, the angle in the fourth quadrant   will ...\u00a0below the ... ...-axis or ....\u00a0 Remember that we\u2019re typically looking for   positive angles between 0 and .......\u00a0...Now we come to the very important difference between this   problem and the previous problems in this section.\u00a0 The solution is ... ...This is not the set of solutions because we are NOT   looking for values of ... for which ...,   but instead we are looking for values of ...   for which ....\u00a0 Note the difference in the arguments of the   sine function!\u00a0 One is ... and the other is ....\u00a0 This makes all the difference in the world   in finding the solution! Therefore, the set of solutions is...Well, actually, that\u2019s not quite the solution.\u00a0 We are looking for values of ... so divide everything by 5 to get....Notice that we also divided the ...by 5 as well!\u00a0 This is important!\u00a0 If we don\u2019t do that you ... miss solutions.\u00a0 For instance, take .......I\u2019ll leave it to you to verify my work showing they are   solutions.\u00a0 However it makes the   point.\u00a0 If you didn\u2019t divided the ...by 5 you would have missed these   solutions!...\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve gotten all possible solutions it\u2019s   time to find the solutions on the given interval.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do this as we did in the previous   problem.\u00a0 Pick values of ... and get the solutions....\u00a0...\u00a0...0...= 1...= 2....= 3...= 4...= 5...\u00a0...Okay, so we finally got past the right endpoint of our   interval so we don\u2019t need any more positive ....\u00a0 Now let\u2019s take a look   at the negative ... and see what   we\u2019ve got....\u00a0...= ...1   ...\u00a0...= ...2...= ...3...= ...4...And we\u2019re now past the left endpoint of the interval.\u00a0 Sometimes, there will be many solutions as   there were in this example.\u00a0 Putting   all of this together gives the following set of solutions that lie in the   given interval....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another example....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0on ...This problem is a little different from the previous   ones.\u00a0 First, we need to do some   rearranging and simplification....So, solving ...\u00a0is the same as solving ....\u00a0\u00a0 At some level we didn\u2019t need to do this   for this problem as all we\u2019re looking for is angles in which sine and cosine   have the same value, but opposite signs.\u00a0   However, for other problems this won\u2019t be the case and we\u2019ll want to   convert to tangent....\u00a0...Looking at our trusty unit circle it appears that the   solutions will be,...Or, upon dividing by the 2 we get all possible solutions....Now, let\u2019s determine the solutions that lie in the given   interval....\u00a0...= 0...= 1...\u00a0...Unlike the previous example only one of these will be in   the interval.\u00a0 This will happen   occasionally so don\u2019t always expect both answers from a particular ... to work.\u00a0 Also, we should now check ... for the first to see if it will be   in or out of the interval.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave   it to you to check that it\u2019s out of the interval....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s check the negative .......= ...1...= ...2...\u00a0...Again, only one will work here.\u00a0 I\u2019ll leave it to you to verify that ...= ...3   will give two answers that are both out of the interval....\u00a0...The complete list of solutions is then,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work one more example so that I can make a point that needs to be understood when solving some trig equations....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...This example is designed to remind you of certain   properties about sine and cosine.\u00a0   Recall that ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Therefore, since cosine will never be   greater that 1 it definitely can\u2019t be 2.\u00a0   So ...   to this equation!...\u00a0...It is important to remember that not all trig equations   will have solutions....\u00a0...In this section we solved some simple trig equations.\u00a0 There are more complicated trig equations that we can solve so don\u2019t leave this section with the feeling that there is nothing harder out there in the world to solve.\u00a0 In fact, we\u2019ll see at least one of the more complicated problems in the next section.\u00a0 Also, every one of these problems came down to solutions involving one of the \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d angles.\u00a0 Most trig equations won\u2019t come down to one of those and will in fact need a calculator to solve.\u00a0 The next section is devoted to this kind of problem....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/TrigEquations.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Calculus I - Review : Solving Trig Equations", "subject": "math"}},

means that there is a nice relationship between these two functions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see just what that relationship is.\u00a0 Consider the following evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...In the first case we plugged ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and got a value of -5.\u00a0 We then turned around and plugged ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and got a value of -1, the number that we started off with.\u00a0

really,...\u00a0...Note as well that these both agree with the formula for the compositions that we found in the previous section.\u00a0 We get back out of the function evaluation the number that we originally plugged into the composition....\u00a0...So, just what is going on here?\u00a0 In some way we can think of these two functions as undoing what the other did to a number.\u00a0 In the first case we plugged ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and then plugged the result from this function evaluation back into ...\u00a0and in some way ...\u00a0undid what ...\u00a0had done to ...\u00a0and gave us back the original ... that we started with....\u00a0...Function pairs that exhibit this behavior are called ....\u00a0 Before formally defining inverse functions and the notation that we\u2019re going to use for them we need to get a definition out of the way. \u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...A function is called ... if no two values of ... produce the same ....\u00a0 Mathematically this is the same as saying,...So, a function is one-to-one if whenever we plug different values into the function we get different function values....\u00a0...Sometimes it is easier to understand this definition if we see a function that isn\u2019t one-to-one.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at a function that isn\u2019t one-to-one.\u00a0 The function ...\u00a0is not one-to-one because both ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 In other words there are two different values of ... that produce the same value of ....\u00a0 Note that we can turn ...\u00a0into a one-to-one function if we restrict ourselves to ....\u00a0 This can sometimes be done with functions....\u00a0...Showing that a function is one-to-one is often tedious and/or difficult.\u00a0 For the most part we are going to assume that the functions that we\u2019re going to be dealing with in this course are either one-to-one or we have restricted the domain of the function to get it to be a one-to-one function....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s formally define just what inverse functions are.\u00a0 Given two one-to-one functions ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0if...then we say that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are ... of each other.\u00a0 More specifically we will say that ...\u00a0is the ... of ...\u00a0and denote it by...Likewise we could also say that ...\u00a0is the ... of ...\u00a0and denote it by...\u00a0...The notation that we use really depends upon the problem.\u00a0 In most cases either is acceptable....\u00a0...For the two functions that we started off this section with we could write either of the following two sets of notation....\u00a0...Now, be careful with the notation for inverses.\u00a0 The \u201c-1\u201d is NOT an exponent despite the fact that is sure does look like one!\u00a0 When dealing with inverse functions we\u2019ve got to remember that ...This is one of the more common mistakes that students make when first studying inverse functions....\u00a0...The process for finding the inverse of a function is a fairly simple one although there are a couple of steps that can on occasion be somewhat messy.\u00a0 Here is the process...\u00a0...Given the function ...\u00a0we want to find the inverse function, .......\u00a0...That\u2019s the process.\u00a0 Most of the steps are not all that bad but as mentioned in the process there are a couple of steps that we really need to be careful with since it is easy to make mistakes in those steps....\u00a0...In the verification step we technically really do need to check that both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are true.\u00a0 For all the functions that we are going to be looking at in this course if one is true then the other will also be true.\u00a0 However, there are functions (they are beyond the scope of this course however) for which it is possible for only one of these to be true.\u00a0 This is brought up because in all the problems here we will be just checking one of them.\u00a0 We just need to always remember that technically we should check both....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some examples....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0find .......\u00a0...Now, we already know what the inverse to this function is   as we\u2019ve already done some work with it.\u00a0   However, it would be nice to actually start with this since we know   what we should get.\u00a0 This will work as   a nice verification of the process....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started.\u00a0   We\u2019ll first replace ...\u00a0with .......\u00a0...Next, replace all ...\u2019s   with ... and all ... with .......\u00a0...Now, solve for .......\u00a0...Finally replace ...   with .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, we need to verify the results.\u00a0 We already took care of this in the   previous section, however, we really should follow the process so we\u2019ll do   that here.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter which of   the two that we check we just need to check one of them.\u00a0 This time we\u2019ll check that ...\u00a0is true....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0find .......\u00a0...The fact that we\u2019re using ...\u00a0instead of ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t change how the process works.\u00a0 Here are the first few steps....\u00a0...Now, to solve for ...   we will need to first square both sides and then proceed as normal....\u00a0...This inverse is then,...\u00a0...Finally let\u2019s verify and this time we\u2019ll use the other one   just so we can say that we\u2019ve gotten both down somewhere in an example....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we did the work correctly and we do indeed have the   inverse....\u00a0...The next example can be a little messy so be careful with the work here....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0find .......The first couple of steps are pretty much the same as the   previous examples so here they are,...\u00a0...Now, be careful with the solution step.\u00a0 With this kind of problem it is very easy   to make a mistake here....\u00a0...So, if we\u2019ve done all of our work correctly the inverse   should be,...\u00a0...Finally we\u2019ll need to do the verification.\u00a0 This is also a fairly messy process and it   doesn\u2019t really matter which one we work with....\u00a0...Okay, this is a mess.\u00a0   Let\u2019s simplify things up a little bit by multiplying the numerator and   denominator by .......Wow.\u00a0 That was a lot   of work, but it all worked out in the end.\u00a0   We did all of our work correctly and we do in fact have the inverse....\u00a0...There is one final topic that we need to address quickly before we leave this section.\u00a0 There is an interesting relationship between the graph of a function and the graph of its inverse....\u00a0...Here is the graph of the function and inverse from the first two examples.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...In both cases we can see that the graph of the

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "The intent of this section is to remind you of some of the more important (from a Calculus standpoint\u2026) topics from a trig class.\u00a0 One of the most important (but not the first) of these topics will be how to use the unit circle.\u00a0 We will actually leave the most important topic to the next section....\u00a0...First let\u2019s start with the six trig functions and how they relate to each other....\u00a0...\u00a0...Recall as well that all the trig functions can be defined in terms of a right triangle....\u00a0...From this right triangle we get the following definitions of the six trig functions....\u00a0...Remembering both the relationship between all six of the trig functions and their right triangle definitions will be useful in this course on occasion. ...\u00a0...Next, we need to touch on radians.\u00a0 In most trig classes instructors tend to concentrate on doing everything in terms of degrees (probably because it\u2019s easier to visualize degrees).\u00a0 The same is true in many science classes.\u00a0 However, in a calculus course almost everything is done in radians.\u00a0 The following table gives some of the basic angles in both degrees and radians....\u00a0...Degree...0...30...45...60...90...180...270...360...Radians...0...\u00a0...Know this table!\u00a0 We may not see these specific angles all that much when we get into the Calculus portion of these notes, but knowing these can help us to visualize each angle.\u00a0 Now, one more time just make sure this is clear....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s next take a look at one of the most overlooked ideas from a trig class.\u00a0 The unit circle is one of the more useful tools to come out of a trig class.\u00a0 Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t learn it as well as they should in their trig class.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Below is the unit circle with just the first quadrant filled in.\u00a0 The way the unit circle works is to draw a line from the center of the circle outwards corresponding to a given angle.\u00a0 Then look at the coordinates of the point where the line and the circle intersect.\u00a0 The first coordinate is the cosine of that angle and the second coordinate is the sine of that angle.\u00a0 We\u2019ve put some of the ... angles along with the coordinates of their intersections on the unit circle.\u00a0 So, from the unit circle below we can see that ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Remember how the signs of angles work.\u00a0 If you rotate in a counter clockwise direction the angle is positive and if you rotate in a clockwise direction the angle is negative....\u00a0...Recall as well that one complete revolution is ..., so the positive ...-axis can correspond to either an angle of 0 or ...\u00a0(or ..., or ..., or ..., or ..., .... depending on the direction of rotation).\u00a0 ...Likewise, the angle ...\u00a0(to pick an angle completely at random) can also be any of the following angles:...\u00a0...\u00a0(start at ...\u00a0then rotate once around counter clockwise)...\u00a0...\u00a0(start at ...\u00a0then rotate around twice counter clockwise)...\u00a0...\u00a0(start at ...\u00a0then rotate once around clockwise)...\u00a0...\u00a0(start at ...\u00a0then rotate around twice clockwise)...\u00a0...\u00a0...In fact ...\u00a0can be any of the following angles ...\u00a0In this case ... is the number of complete revolutions you make around the unit circle starting at ....\u00a0 Positive values of ... correspond to counter clockwise rotations and negative values of ... correspond to clockwise rotations....\u00a0...So, why did I only put in the first quadrant?\u00a0 The answer is simple.\u00a0 If you know the first quadrant then you can get all the other quadrants from the first with a small application of geometry.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see how this is done in the following set of examples. ...\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The first evaluation in this part uses the angle ....\u00a0 That\u2019s not on our unit circle above,   however notice that ....\u00a0 So ...\u00a0is found by rotating up ...\u00a0from the negative ...-axis.\u00a0 This means that   the line for ...\u00a0will be a mirror image of the line for ...\u00a0only in the second quadrant.\u00a0 The coordinates for ...\u00a0will be the coordinates for ...\u00a0except the ... coordinate will be negative. ...\u00a0...Likewise for ...we can notice that ...,   so this angle can be found by rotating down ...\u00a0from the negative ...-axis.\u00a0 This means that the   line for ...\u00a0will be a mirror image of the line for ...\u00a0only in the third quadrant and the   coordinates will be the same as the coordinates for ...\u00a0except both will be negative....\u00a0...Both of these angles along with their coordinates are   shown on the following unit circle. ...From this unit circle we can see that ...and .......\u00a0...This leads to a nice fact about the sine function.\u00a0 The sine function is called an ... function and so for ANY angle we   have ...\u00a0... For this example notice that ...\u00a0so this means we would rotate down ...\u00a0from the negative ...-axis to get to this angle. Also ...\u00a0so this means we would rotate up ...\u00a0from the negative ...-axis to get to this angle.\u00a0   So, as with the last part, both of these angles will be mirror images   of ...\u00a0in the third and second quadrants   respectively and we can use this to determine the coordinates for both of   these new angles....\u00a0...Both of these angles are shown on the following unit   circle along with appropriate coordinates for the intersection points....\u00a0...From this unit circle we can see that ...and ....\u00a0 In this case the cosine function is called   an ... function and so for ANY   angle we have .......\u00a0...

that avoid these   two points and test the sign of the function at a single point in each of the   regions.\u00a0 If the function is positive   at a single point in the region it will be positive at all points in that   region because it doesn\u2019t contain the any of the points where the function   may change sign.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have a similar   situation if the function is negative for the

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "This is a set of errors that really doesn\u2019t fit into any of the other topics so I included all them here....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is probably one of the biggest mistakes that students make.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to read the instructions and the problem statement carefully.\u00a0 Make sure you understand what you are being asked to do BEFORE you start working the problem...\u00a0...Far too often students run with the assumption : \u201cIt\u2019s in section X so they must want me to ____________.\u201d\u00a0 In many cases you simply can\u2019t assume that.\u00a0 Do not just skim the instruction or read the first few words and assume you know the rest....\u00a0...Instructions will often contain information pertaining to the steps that your instructor wants to see and the form the final answer must be in.\u00a0 Also, many math problems can proceed in several ways depending on one or two words in the problem statement.\u00a0 If you miss those one or two words, you may end up going down the wrong path and getting the problem completely wrong....\u00a0...Not reading the instructions is probably the biggest source of point loss for my students....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is an error that is often compounded by instructors (me included on occasion, I must admit) that don\u2019t give or make a big deal about restrictions on formulas.\u00a0 In some cases the instructors forget the restrictions, in others they seem to have the idea that the restrictions are so obvious that they don\u2019t need to give them, and in other cases the instructors just don\u2019t want to be bothered with explaining the restrictions so they don\u2019t give them....\u00a0...For instance, in an algebra class you should have run across the following formula....\u00a0...\u00a0...The problem is there is a restriction on this formula and many instructors don\u2019t bother with it and so students aren\u2019t always aware of it.\u00a0 Even if instructors do give the restriction on this formula many students forget it as they are rarely faced with a case where the formula doesn\u2019t work....\u00a0...Take a look at the following example to see what happens when the restriction is violated (I\u2019ll give the restriction at the end of example.)...\u00a0...\u00a0...So clearly we\u2019ve got a problem here as we are well aware that ...!\u00a0 The problem arose in step 3.\u00a0 The property that I used has the restriction that ... and ... can\u2019t both be negative.\u00a0 It is okay if one or the other is negative, but they can\u2019t BOTH be negative!...\u00a0...Ignoring this kind of restriction can cause some real problems as the above example shows....\u00a0...There is also an example from calculus of this kind of problem.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t had calculus then you can skip this one.\u00a0 One of the more basic formulas that you\u2019ll get is...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is where most instructors leave it, despite the fact that there is a fairly important restriction that needs to be given as well.\u00a0 I suspect most instructors are so used to using the formula that they just implicitly feel that everyone knows the restriction and so don\u2019t have to give it.\u00a0 I know that I\u2019ve done this myself here!...\u00a0...In order to use this formula n MUST be a fixed constant!\u00a0 In other words you can\u2019t use the formula to find the derivative of ...\u00a0since the exponent is not a fixed constant.\u00a0 If you tried to use the rule to find the derivative of ...\u00a0you would arrive at...\u00a0...\u00a0...and the correct derivative is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, you can see that what we got by incorrectly using the formula is not even close to the correct answer....\u00a0...\u00a0...Since I started writing my own homework problems I don\u2019t run into this as often as I used to, but it annoyed me so much that I thought I\u2019d go ahead and include it....\u00a0...In the past, I\u2019d occasionally assign problems from the text with answers given in the back.\u00a0 Early in the semester I would get homework sets that had incorrect work but the correct answer just blindly copied out of the back.\u00a0 Rather than go back and find their mistake the students would just copy the correct answer down in the hope that I\u2019d miss it while grading.\u00a0 While on occasion I\u2019m sure that I did miss it, when I did catch it, it cost the students far more points than the original mistake would have cost them....\u00a0...So, if you do happen to know what the answer is ahead of time and your answer doesn\u2019t match it GO BACK AND FIND YOUR MISTAKE!!!!!\u00a0 Do not just write the correct answer down and hope.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t find your mistake then write down the answer you get, not the known and (hopefully) correct answer....\u00a0...I can\u2019t speak for other instructors, but if I see the correct answer that isn\u2019t supported by your work you will lose far more points than the original mistake would have cost you had you just written down the incorrect answer....\u00a0...\u00a0...This error is similar to the previous one in that it assumes that you have the known answer ahead of time.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Occasionally there are problems for which you can get the answer to intermediate step by looking at the known answer.\u00a0 In these cases do not just assume that your initial work is correct and write down the intermediate answer from the known answer without actually doing the work to get the answers to those intermediate steps.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Do the work and check your answers against the known answer to make sure you didn\u2019t make a mistake.\u00a0 If your work doesn\u2019t match the known answer then you know you made a mistake.\u00a0 Go back and find it....\u00a0...There are certain problems in a differential equations class in which if you know the answer ahead of time you can get the roots of a quadratic equation that you must solve as well as the solution to a system of equations that you must also solve.\u00a0 I won\u2019t bore you with the details of these types of problems, but I once had a student who was notorious for this kind of error....\u00a0...There was one problem in particular in which he had written down the quadratic equation and had made a very simple sign mistake, but he assumed that he would be able to solve the quadratic equation without any problems so just wrote down the roots of the equation that he got by looking at the known answer.\u00a0 He then proceeded with the problem, made a couple more very simple and easy to catch mistakes and arrived at the system of equations that he needed to solve.\u00a0 Again, because of his mistakes it was the incorrect system, but he simply assumed he would solve it correctly if he had done the work and wrote down the answer he got by looking at the solution....\u00a0...This student received almost no points on this problem because he decided that in a differential equations class solving a quadratic equation or a simple system of equations was beneath him and that he would do it correctly every time if he were to do the work.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, he would skip the work and write down what he knew the answers to these intermediate steps to be by looking at the known answer.\u00a0 If he had simply done the work he would have realized he made a mistake and could have found the mistakes as they were typically easy to catch mistakes....\u00a0...So, the moral of the story is DO THE WORK.\u00a0 Don\u2019t just assume that if you were to do the work you would get the correct answer.\u00a0 Do the work and if it\u2019s the same as the known answer then you did everything correctly, if not you made a mistake so go back and find it....\u00a0...\u00a0...When you\u2019re done working problems go back and make sure that your answer makes sense.\u00a0 Often the problems are such that certain answers just won\u2019t make sense, so once you\u2019ve gotten an answer ask yourself if it makes sense.\u00a0 If it doesn\u2019t make sense then you\u2019ve probably made a mistake so go back and try to find it....\u00a0...Here are a couple of examples that I\u2019ve actually gotten from students over the years....\u00a0...In an algebra class we would occasionally work interest problems where we would invest a certain amount of money in an account that earned interest at a specific rate for a specific number of year/months/days depending on the problem.\u00a0 First, if you are earning interest then the amount of money should grow, so if you end up with less than you started you\u2019ve made a mistake.\u00a0 Likewise, if you only invest $2000 for a couple of years at a small interest rate you shouldn\u2019t have a couple of billion dollars in the account after two years!...\u00a0...Back in my graduate student days I was teaching a trig class and we were going to try and determine the height of a very well known building on campus given the length of the shadow and the angle of the sun in the sky.\u00a0 I doubt that anyone in the class knew the actual height of the building, but they had to know that it wasn\u2019t over two miles tall!\u00a0\u00a0 I actually got an answer that was over two miles.\u00a0 It clearly wasn\u2019t a correct answer, but instead of going back to find the mistake (a very simple mistake was made) the student circled the obviously incorrect answer and moved on to the next problem....\u00a0...Often the mistake that gives an obviously incorrect answer is an easy one to find.\u00a0 So, check your answer and make sure that they make sense!...\u00a0...\u00a0...I can not stress how important this one is!\u00a0 CHECK YOUR WORK!\u00a0 You will often catch simple mistakes by going back over your work.\u00a0 The best way to do this, although it\u2019s time consuming, is to put your work away then come back and rework all the problems and check your new answers to those previously gotten.\u00a0 This is time consuming and so can\u2019t always be done, but it is the best way to check your work....\u00a0...If you don\u2019t have that kind of time available to you, then at least read through your work.\u00a0 You won\u2019t catch all the mistakes this way, but you might catch some of the more glaring mistakes....\u00a0...Depending on your instructors beliefs about working groups you might want to check your answer against other students.\u00a0 Some instructors frown on this and want you to do all your work individually, but if your instructor doesn\u2019t mind this, it\u2019s a nice way to catch mistakes....\u00a0...\u00a0...The title here doesn\u2019t do a good job of describing the kinds of errors here, but once you see the kind of errors that I\u2019m talking about you will understand it....\u00a0...Too often students make the following logic errors.\u00a0 Since the following formula is true...\u00a0...\u00a0...there must be a similar formula for ...\u00a0.\u00a0 In other words, if the formula works for one algebraic operation (i.e. addition, subtraction, division, and/or multiplication) it must work for all.\u00a0 The problem is that this usually isn\u2019t true! \u00a0In this case...\u00a0...\u00a0...Likewise, from calculus students make the mistake that because...\u00a0...\u00a0...the same must be true for a product of functions. Again, however, it doesn\u2019t work that way!...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, don\u2019t try to extend formulas that work for certain algebraic operations to all algebraic operations.\u00a0 If you were given a formula for certain algebraic operation, but not others there was a reason for that.\u00a0 In all likelihood it only works for those operations in which you were given the formula!...\u00a0...\u00a0...For some reason students seem to develop the attitude that everything must be rounded as much as possible.\u00a0 This has gone so far that I\u2019ve actually had students who refused to work with decimals!\u00a0 Every answer was rounded to the nearest integer, regardless of how wrong that made the answer....\u00a0...There are simply some problems were rounding too much can get you in trouble and seriously change the answer.\u00a0 The best example of this is interest problems.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a quick example.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Recall (provided you\u2019ve seen this formula) that if you invest ... dollars at an interest rate of r that is compounded m times per year, then after t years you will have ... dollars where,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0...So, let\u2019s assume that we invest $10,000 at an interest rate of 6.5% compounded monthly for 15 years.\u00a0 So, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got...\u00a0...\u00a0...Remember that the interest rate is always divided by 100!\u00a0 So, here\u2019s what we will have after 15 years....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, after 15 years we will have $26,442.01.\u00a0 You will notice that I didn\u2019t round until the very last step and that was only because we were working with money which usually only has two decimal places.\u00a0 That is required in these problems.\u00a0 Here are some examples of rounding to show you how much difference rounding too much can make.\u00a0 At each step I\u2019ll round each answer to the give number of decimal places....\u00a0...First, I\u2019ll do the extreme case of no decimal places at all, i.e. only integers.\u00a0 This is an extreme case, but I\u2019ve run across it occasionally....\u00a0...\u00a0...It\u2019s extreme but it makes the point....\u00a0...Now, I\u2019ll round to three decimal places....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, round to five decimal places....\u00a0...\u00a0...Finally, round to seven decimal places....\u00a0...\u00a0...I skipped a couple of possibilities in the computations.\u00a0 Here is a table of all possibilities from 0 decimal places to 8....\u00a0...Decimal places...of rounding...Amount after...15 years...Error in...Answer...0...$10,000.00...$16,442.01 (Under)...1...$10,000.00...$16,442.01 (Under)...2...$60,000.00...$33,557.99 (Over)...3...$24,540.00...$1,902.01 (Under)...4...$26,363.00...$79.01 (Under)...5...$26,457.80...$15.79 (Over)...6...$26,443.59...$1.58 (Over)...7...$26,442.17...$0.16 (Over)...8...$26,442.02...$0.01 (Over)...\u00a0...So, notice that it takes at least 4 digits of rounding to start getting \u201cclose\u201d to the actual answer.\u00a0 Note as well that in the world of business the answers we got with 4, 5, 6 and 7 decimal places of rounding would probably also be unacceptable.\u00a0 In a few cases (such as banks) where every penny counts even the last answer would also be unacceptable!...\u00a0...So, the point here is that you must be careful with rounding.\u00a0 There are some situations where too much rounding can drastically change the answer!...\u00a0...\u00a0...These are not really errors, but bad notation that always sets me on edge when I see it.\u00a0 Some instructors, including me after a while, will take off points for these things.\u00a0 This is just notational stuff that you should get out of the habit of writing if you do it.\u00a0 You should reach a certain mathematical \u201cmaturity\u201d after awhile and not use this kind of notation....\u00a0...First, I see the following all too often,...The ...\u00a0just makes no sense!\u00a0 It combines into a negative SO WRITE IT LIKE THAT!\u00a0 Here\u2019s the correct way,...\u00a0...This is the correct way to do it!\u00a0 I expect my students to do this as well....\u00a0...Next, one (the number) times something is just the something, there is no reason to continue to write the one.\u00a0 For instance,...Do not write this as ...!\u00a0 The coefficient of one is not needed here since ...!\u00a0 Do not write the coefficient of 1!...\u00a0...This same thing holds for an exponent of one anything to the first power is the anything so there is usually no reason to write the one down!...In my classes, I will attempt to stop this behavior with comments initially, but if that isn\u2019t enough to stop it, I will start taking points off....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/CommonErrors/CommonErrors.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Common Math Errors - Common Errors", "subject": "math"}},

Recall that   with division we just need to eliminate the ... from the denominator and using ...   we know how to do that.\u00a0 All we need to   do is multiply the numerator and denominator by ...\u00a0and we will eliminate the ... from the denominator.... We\u2019ll do   this one a little quicker....\u00a0...Now, for the most part this is all that you need to know about subtraction and multiplication of complex numbers for this rest of this document.\u00a0 However, let\u2019s take a look at a more precise and mathematical definition of both of these.\u00a0 If you aren\u2019t interested in this then you can skip this and still be able to understand the remainder of this document.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The remainder of this document involves topics that are typically first taught in a Abstract/Modern Algebra class.\u00a0 Since we are going to be applying them to the field of complex variables we won\u2019t be going into great detail about the concepts.\u00a0 Also note that we\u2019re going to be skipping some of the ideas and glossing over some of the details that don\u2019t really come into play in complex numbers.\u00a0 This will especially be true with the \u201cdefinitions\u201d of inverses.\u00a0 The definitions I\u2019ll be giving below are correct for complex numbers, but in a more general setting are not quite correct.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need to worry about this in general to understand what were going to be doing below. \u00a0I just wanted to make it clear that I\u2019m skipping some of the more general definitions for easier to work with definitions that are valid in complex numbers....\u00a0...Okay, now that I\u2019ve got the warnings/notes out of the way let\u2019s get started on the actual topic\u2026...\u00a0...Technically, the only arithmetic operations that are defined on complex numbers are addition and multiplication.\u00a0 This means that both subtraction and division will, in some way, need to be defined in terms of these two operations.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with subtraction since it is (hopefully) a little easier to see....\u00a0...We first need to define something called an ....\u00a0 An additive inverse is some element typically denoted by ...\u00a0so that...\u00a0...Now, in the general field of abstract algebra, ...\u00a0is just the notation for the additive inverse and in many cases is NOT give by ...!\u00a0 Luckily for us however, with complex variables that is exactly how the additive inverse is defined and so for a given complex number ...\u00a0the additive inverse, ..., is given by,...It is easy to see that this does meet the definition of the additive inverse and so that won\u2019t be shown....\u00a0...With this definition we can now officially define the subtraction of two complex numbers.\u00a0 Given two complex numbers ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we define the subtraction of them as,...Or, in other words, when subtracting ...\u00a0from ...\u00a0we are really just adding the additive inverse of ...\u00a0(which is denoted by ...) to ....\u00a0 If we further use the definition of the additive inverses for complex numbers we can arrive at the formula given above for subtraction....\u00a0...So, that wasn\u2019t too bad I hope.\u00a0 Most of the problems that students have with these kinds of topics is that they need to ... some notation and ideas that they are very used to working with.\u00a0 Or, to put it another way, you\u2019ve always been taught that ...is just a shorthand notation for ..., but in the general topic of abstract algebra this does not necessarily have to be the case.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that in all of the examples where you are liable to run into the notation ...\u00a0in \u201creal life\u201d, whatever that means, we really do mean .......\u00a0...Okay, now that we have subtraction out of the way, let\u2019s move on to division.\u00a0 As with subtraction we first need to define an inverse.\u00a0 This time we\u2019ll need a ....\u00a0 A multiplicative inverse for a non-zero complex number ... is an element denoted by ...\u00a0such that...Now, again, be careful not to make the assumption that the \u201cexponent\u201d of -1 on the notation is in fact an exponent.\u00a0 It isn\u2019t!\u00a0 It is just a notation that is used to denote the multiplicative inverse.\u00a0 With real (non-zero) numbers this turns out to be a real exponent and we do have that ...for instance.\u00a0 However, with complex numbers this will not be the case!\u00a0 In fact, let\u2019s see just what the multiplicative inverse for a complex number is.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start out with the complex number ...\u00a0and let\u2019s call its multiplicative inverse ....\u00a0 Now, we know that we must have ...so, let\u2019s actual do the multiplication....\u00a0...This tells us that we have to have the following,...Solving this system of two equations for the two unknowns ... and ...

take a look at since they tend to show up on occasion.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also take a look at quite a few nice facts about these operations....\u00a0...The first one we\u2019ll look at is the ..., (or just the conjugate).\u00a0 Given the complex number ...\u00a0the complex conjugate is denoted by ...\u00a0and is defined to be,...\u00a0...In other words, we just switch the sign on the imaginary part of the number....\u00a0...Here are some basic facts about conjugates....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...The first one just says that if we conjugate twice we get back to what we started with originally and hopefully this makes some sense.\u00a0 The remaining three just say we can break up sum, differences, products and quotients into the individual pieces and then conjugate....\u00a0...So, just so we can say that we worked a number example or two let\u2019s do a couple of examples illustrating the above facts....\u00a0...Compute   each of the following....\u00a0for ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0for ...\u00a0and ...There really isn\u2019t much to do with these other than to so   the work so,...Sure enough we can see that after conjugating twice we get   back to our original number....\u00a0... ...\u00a0... ...We can see that results from ... and ... are the   same as the fact implied they would be....\u00a0...There is another nice fact that uses conjugates that we should probably take a look at.\u00a0 However, instead of just giving the fact away let\u2019s derive it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with a complex number ...\u00a0and then perform each of the following operations....Now, recalling that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0we see that we have,...The other operation we want to take a look at in this section is the ... of a complex number.\u00a0 Given a complex number ...\u00a0the modulus is denoted by ...\u00a0and is defined by...Notice that the modulus of a complex number is always a real number and in fact it will never be negative since square roots always return a positive number or zero depending on what is under the radical....\u00a0...Notice that if ... is a real number (... ...) then,...where the ...\u00a0on the ... is the modulus of the complex number and the ...\u00a0on the ... is the absolute value of a real number (recall that in general for any real number ... we have ...).\u00a0 So, from this we can see that for real numbers the modulus and absolute value are essentially the same thing....\u00a0...We can get a nice fact about the relationship between the modulus of a complex numbers

this section we\u2019ll look at both of those as well as a couple of nice facts that arise from them....\u00a0...Before we get into the alternate forms we should first take a very brief look at a natural geometric interpretation to a complex numbers since this will lead us into our first alternate form....\u00a0...Consider the complex number ....\u00a0 We can think of this complex number as either the point\u00a0 ...\u00a0in the standard Cartesian coordinate system or as the vector that starts at the origin and ends at the point ....\u00a0 An example of this is shown in the figure below....\u00a0...In this interpretation we call the ...-axis the ... and the ...-axis the ....\u00a0 We often call the ...-plane in this interpretation the .......\u00a0...Note as well that we can now get a geometric interpretation of the ....\u00a0 From the image above we can see that ...is nothing more than the length of the vector that we\u2019re using to represent the complex number ....\u00a0 This interpretation also tells us that the inequality ...\u00a0means that ...\u00a0is closer to the origin (in the complex plane) than ...\u00a0is....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now take a look at the first alternate form for a complex number.\u00a0 If we think of the non-zero complex number ...\u00a0as the point ...\u00a0in the ...-plane we also know that we can represent this point by the polar coordinates ..., where ... is the distance of the point from the origin and ...\u00a0is the angle, in radians, from the positive ...-axis to the ray connecting the origin to the point....\u00a0...When working with complex numbers we assume that ... is positive and that ...\u00a0can be any of the possible (both positive and negative) angles that end at the ray.\u00a0 Note that this means that there are literally an infinite number of choices for .......\u00a0...We excluded ...\u00a0since ...\u00a0is not defined for the point (0,0).\u00a0 We will therefore only consider the polar form of non-zero complex numbers....\u00a0...We have the following ... formulas for converting the polar coordinates ...\u00a0into the corresponding Cartesian coordinates of the point, .......\u00a0...\u00a0...If we substitute these into ...\u00a0and factor an ... out we arrive at the ... of the complex number,...\u00a0...Note as well that we also have the following formula from polar coordinates relating ... to ... and .......but, the right side is nothing more than the definition of the modulus and so we see that,...\u00a0...So, sometimes the polar form will be written as,...\u00a0...The angle ...\u00a0is called the ... of ... and is denoted by,...The argument of ... can be any of the infinite possible values of ...\u00a0each of which can be found by solving...and making sure that ...\u00a0is in the correct quadrant....\u00a0...Note as well that any two values of the argument will differ from each other by an integer multiple of ....\u00a0 This makes sense when you consider the following.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...For a given complex number ... pick any of the possible values of the argument, say ....\u00a0 If you now increase the value of ..., which is really just increasing the angle that the point makes with the positive ...-axis, you are rotating the point about the origin in a counter-clockwise manner.\u00a0 Since it takes ...\u00a0radians to make one complete revolution you will be back at your initial starting point when you reach ...\u00a0and so have a new value of the argument.\u00a0 See the figure below....\u00a0...If you keep increasing the angle you will again be back at the starting point when you reach ..., which is again a new value of the argument.\u00a0 Continuing in this fashion we can see that every time we reach a new value of the argument we will simply be adding multiples of ...\u00a0onto the original value of the argument....\u00a0...Likewise, if you start at ...\u00a0and decrease the angle you will be rotating the point about the origin in a clockwise manner and will return to your original starting point when you reach ....\u00a0 Continuing in this fashion and we can again see that each new value of the argument will be found by subtracting a multiple of ...\u00a0from the original value of the argument....\u00a0...So we can see that if ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are two values of arg ... then for some integer ... we will have,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that we\u2019ve also shown here that ...\u00a0is a parametric representation for a circle of radius ... centered at the origin and that it will trace out a complete circle in a counter-clockwise direction as the angle increases from ...\u00a0to .......\u00a0...The ... of the argument (sometimes called the ...) is the unique value of the argument that is in the range ...\u00a0and is denoted by ....\u00a0 Note that the inequalities at either end of the range tells that a negative real number will have a principal value of the argument of .......\u00a0...Recalling that we noted above that any two values of the argument will differ from each other by a multiple of ...\u00a0leads us to the following fact....\u00a0...We should probably do a couple of quick numerical examples at this point before we move on to look the second alternate form of a complex number....\u00a0...Write   down the polar form of each of the following complex numbers.... Let\u2019s first   get .......Now let\u2019s find the argument of ....\u00a0 This can be any angle   that satisfies ...,   but it\u2019s usually easiest to find the principal value so we\u2019ll find that   one.\u00a0 The principal value of the   argument will be the value of ...\u00a0that is in the range ...,   satisfies,...and is in the second quadrant since that is the location   the complex number in the complex plane....\u00a0...If you\u2019re using a calculator to find the value of this   inverse tangent make sure that you understand that your calculator will only   return values in the range ...\u00a0and so you may get the incorrect value.\u00a0 Recall that if your calculator returns a   value of ...\u00a0then the second value that will also satisfy   the equation will be ....\u00a0 So, if you\u2019re using a calculator be   careful.\u00a0 You will need to compute both   and the determine which falls into the correct quadrant to match the complex   number we have because only one of them will be in the correct quadrant....\u00a0...In our case the two values are,...The first one is in quadrant four and the second one is in   quadrant two and so is the one that we\u2019re after.\u00a0 Therefore, the principal value of the   argument is,...and all possible values of the argument are then...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s actually do what we were originally asked to do.\u00a0 Here is the polar form of .......\u00a0...Now, for the sake of completeness we should acknowledge   that there are many more equally valid polar forms for this complex   number.\u00a0 To get any of the other forms   we just need to compute a different value of the argument by picking ....\u00a0   Here are a couple of other possible polar forms....\u00a0... In this   case we\u2019ve already noted that the principal value of a negative real number   is ...\u00a0so we don\u2019t need to compute that.\u00a0 For completeness sake here are all possible   values of the argument of any negative number....\u00a0...Now, ... is,...The polar form (using the principal value) is,...\u00a0...Note that if we\u2019d had a positive real number the principal   value would be ...\u00a0... This   another special case much like real numbers.\u00a0   If we were to use ... to find the argument we   would run into problems since the real part is zero and this would give   division by zero.\u00a0 However, all we need   to do to get the argument is think about where this complex number is in the   complex plane.\u00a0 In the complex plane   purely imaginary numbers are either on the positive ...-axis or the negative ...-axis   depending on the sign of the imaginary part.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...For our case the imaginary part is positive and so this   complex number will be on the positive ...-axis.\u00a0 Therefore, the principal value and the   general argument for this complex number is,...\u00a0...Also, in this case ...   = 12 and so the polar form (again using the principal value) is,...\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve discussed the polar form of a complex number we can introduce the second alternate form of a complex number.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ll need Euler\u2019s formula,...\u00a0...With Euler\u2019s formula we can rewrite the polar form of a complex number into its ... as follows....where ...\u00a0and so we can see that, much like the polar form, there are an infinite number of possible exponential forms for a given complex number.\u00a0 Also, because any two arguments for a give complex number differ by an integer multiple of ...\u00a0we will sometimes write the exponential form as,...where ...\u00a0is any value of the argument although it is more often than not the principal value of the argument....\u00a0...To get the value of ... we can either use ... to write the exponential form or we can take a more direct approach.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take the direct approach.\u00a0 Take the modulus of both sides and then do a little simplification as follows,...and so we see that .......\u00a0...Note as well that because we can consider ...\u00a0as a parametric representation of a circle of radius ... and the exponential form of a complex number is really another way of writing the polar form we can also consider ...\u00a0a parametric representation of a circle of radius .......\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve got the exponential form of a complex number out of the way we can use this along with basic exponent properties to derive some nice facts about complex numbers and their arguments....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s start with the non-zero complex number ....\u00a0 In the arithmetic section we gave a fairly complex formula for the ..., however, with the exponential form of the complex number we can get a much nicer formula for the multiplicative inverse....Note that since ... is a non-zero real number we know that ....\u00a0 So, putting this together the exponential form of the multiplicative inverse is,...and the polar form of the multiplicative inverse is,...\u00a0...We can also get some nice formulas for the product or quotient of complex numbers.\u00a0 Given two complex numbers ...\u00a0and ..., where ...\u00a0is any value of ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is any value of ..., we have...\u00a0...The polar forms for both of these are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...We can also use ... and ... to get some nice facts about the arguments of a product and a quotient of complex numbers.\u00a0 Since ...\u00a0is any value of ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is any value of ...\u00a0we can see that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that ... and ... may or may not work if you use the principal value of the argument, Arg ....\u00a0 For example, consider ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 In this case we have ...\u00a0and the principal value of the argument for each is,...However,...and so ... doesn\u2019t hold if we use the principal value of the argument.\u00a0 Note however, if we use,...then,...is valid since ...\u00a0is a possible argument for ..., it just isn\u2019t the principal value of the argument....\u00a0...As an interesting side note, ... actually does work for this example if we use the principal arguments.\u00a0 That won\u2019t always happen, but it does in this case so be careful!...\u00a0...We will close this section with a nice fact about the equality of two complex numbers that we will make heavy use of in the next section.\u00a0 Suppose that we have two complex numbers given by their exponential forms, ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Also suppose that we know that ....\u00a0 In this case we have,...\u00a0...Then we will have ...\u00a0if and only if,...\u00a0...Note that the phrase \u201cif and only if\u201d is a fancy mathematical phrase that means that if ...\u00a0is true then so is ... and likewise, if ... is true then we\u2019ll have .......\u00a0...This may seem like a silly fact, but we are going to use this in the next section to help us find the powers and roots of complex numbers....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/ComplexPrimer/Forms.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Complex Number Primer - Polar and Exponential Forms", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "The topics covered here are errors that students often make in doing algebra, and not just errors typically made in an algebra class.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen every one of these mistakes made by students in all level of classes, from algebra classes up to senior level math classes!\u00a0 In fact a few of the examples in this section will actually come from calculus. ...\u00a0...\u00a0If you have not had calculus you can ignore these examples.\u00a0 In every case where I\u2019ve given examples I\u2019ve tried to include examples from an algebra class as well as the occasion example from upper level courses like Calculus....\u00a0...I\u2019m convinced that many of these are mistakes given here are caused by people getting lazy or getting in a hurry and not paying attention to what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 By slowing down, paying attention to what you\u2019re doing and paying attention to proper notation you can avoid the vast majority of these mistakes!...\u00a0...\u00a0...Everyone knows that ...\u00a0the problem is that far too many people also say that ...\u00a0or ...!\u00a0 Remember that division by zero is undefined!\u00a0 You simply cannot divide by zero so don\u2019t do it!...\u00a0...Here is a very good example of the kinds of havoc that can arise when you divide by zero.\u00a0 See if you can find the mistake that I made in the work below....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve managed to prove that 1 = 2!\u00a0 Now, we know that\u2019s not true so clearly we made a mistake somewhere.\u00a0 Can you see where the mistake was made?...\u00a0...The mistake was in step 5.\u00a0 Recall that we started out with the assumption ....\u00a0 However, if this is true then we have ...!\u00a0 So, in step 5 we are really dividing by zero!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...That simple mistake led us to something that we knew wasn\u2019t true, however, in most cases your answer will not obviously be wrong.\u00a0 It will not always be clear that you are dividing by zero, as was the case in this example.\u00a0 You need to be on the lookout for this kind of thing....\u00a0...Remember that you CAN\u2019T divide by zero!...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is probably error that I find to be the most frustrating.\u00a0 There are a couple of errors that people commonly make here.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The first error is that people get lazy and decide that parenthesis aren\u2019t needed at certain steps or that they can remember that the parenthesis are supposed to be there.\u00a0 Of course the problem here is that they often tend to forget about them in the very next step!...\u00a0...The other error is that students sometimes don\u2019t understand just how important parentheses really are.\u00a0 This is often seen in errors made in exponentiation as my first couple of examples show....\u00a0...Square   4.......\u00a0...\u00a0...Note the very important difference between these two!\u00a0 When dealing with exponents remember that   only the quantity immediately to the left of the exponent gets the   exponent.\u00a0 So, in the incorrect case,   the ... is the quantity immediately   to the left of the exponent so we are squaring only the ... while the 4 isn\u2019t squared.\u00a0   In the correct case the parenthesis is immediately to the left of the   exponent so this signifies that everything inside the parenthesis should be   squared!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Parenthesis are required in this case to make sure we   square the whole thing, not just the ...,   so don\u2019t forget them!...\u00a0...Square   -3....\u00a0...\u00a0...This one is similar to the previous one, but has a   subtlety that causes problems on occasion.\u00a0   Remember that only the quantity to the left of the exponent gets the   exponent.\u00a0 So, in the incorrect case   ONLY the 3 is to the left of the exponent and so ONLY the 3 gets squared!...\u00a0...Many people know that technically they are supposed to   square -3, but they get lazy and don\u2019t write the parenthesis down on the   premise that they will remember them when the time comes to actually evaluate   it.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s amazing how many of   these folks promptly forget about the parenthesis and write down -9 anyway!...\u00a0...Subtract   ...\u00a0from ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Be careful and note the difference between the two!\u00a0 In the first case I put parenthesis around   then ...and in the second I didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0 Since we are subtracting a polynomial we   need to make sure we subtract the WHOLE polynomial!\u00a0 The only way to make sure we do that   correctly is to put parenthesis around it....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...Again, this is one of those errors that people do know   that technically the parenthesis should be there, but they don\u2019t put them in   and promptly forget that they were there and do the subtraction incorrectly....\u00a0...Convert   ...\u00a0to fractional exponents....\u00a0...\u00a0...This comes back to same mistake in the first two.\u00a0 If only the quantity to the left of the   exponent gets the exponent.\u00a0 So, the   incorrect case is really ...\u00a0and this is clearly NOT the original root....\u00a0...Evaluate   .......\u00a0...This is a calculus problem, so if you haven\u2019t had calculus   you can ignore this example.\u00a0 However,   far too many of my calculus students make this mistake for me to ignore it....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note the use of the parenthesis.\u00a0 The problem states that it is -3 times the   WHOLE integral not just the first term of the integral (as is done in the   incorrect example)....\u00a0...\u00a0...Be careful when using the distribution property!\u00a0 There two main errors that I run across on a regular basis....\u00a0...Multiply   .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Make sure that you distribute the 4 all the way through   the parenthesis!\u00a0 Too often people just   multiply the first term by the 4 and ignore the second term.\u00a0 This is especially true when the second   term is just a number.\u00a0 For some   reason, if the second term contains variables students will remember to do   the distribution correctly more often than not....\u00a0...Multiply   .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Remember that exponentiation must be performed BEFORE you   distribute any coefficients through the parenthesis!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...I didn\u2019t know what else to call this, but it\u2019s an error that many students make.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the assumption.\u00a0 Since ...\u00a0then everything works like this.\u00a0 However, here is a whole list in which this doesn\u2019t work....\u00a0...\u00a0...It\u2019s not hard to convince yourself that any of these aren\u2019t true.\u00a0 Just pick a couple of numbers and plug them in!\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...\u00a0...You will find the occasional set of numbers for which one of these rules will work, but they don\u2019t work for almost any randomly chosen pair of numbers....\u00a0...Note that there are far more examples where this ... assumption doesn\u2019t work than what I\u2019ve listed here.\u00a0 I simply wrote down the ones that I see most often.\u00a0 Also a couple of those that I listed could be made more general.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...These errors fall into two categories.\u00a0 Simplifying rational expressions and solving equations. Let\u2019s look at simplifying rational expressions first....\u00a0...Simplify   ...\u00a0(done correctly)....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...   ...\u00a0...Notice that in order to cancel the ... out of the denominator I first factored an ...out of the numerator.\u00a0 You can only cancel something if it is   multiplied by the WHOLE numerator and denominator, or if IS the whole   numerator or denominator (as in the case of the denominator in our example).\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Contrast this with the next example which contains a very   common error that students make....\u00a0...Simplify   ...\u00a0(done incorrectly)....\u00a0...Far too many   students try to simplify this as,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...   ...\u00a0...In other words,   they cancel the ... in the   denominator against only one of the ...\u2019s   in the numerator  (... cancel the x only from the first term or only from the second term)..\u00a0   THIS CAN\u2019T BE DONE!!!!!\u00a0 In   order to do this canceling you MUST have an ... in both terms.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...To convince yourself that this kind of canceling isn\u2019t   true consider the following number example....\u00a0...Simplify   .......\u00a0...This can easily be done just be doing the arithmetic as   follows...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...However, let\u2019s do an incorrect cancel similar to the   previous example.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first cancel   the two in the denominator into the eight in the numerator.\u00a0 This is NOT CORRECT, but it mirrors the   canceling that was incorrectly done in the previous example.\u00a0 This gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

before solving.\u00a0 While some simplification is a good and necessary thing, you should NEVER divide out a term as we did in the first attempt when solving.\u00a0 If you do this you WILL loose solutions....\u00a0...\u00a0...There seems to be a very large misconception about the use of square roots out there.\u00a0 Students seem to be under the misconception that ...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is not correct however.\u00a0 Square roots are ALWAYS positive or zero! So the correct value is...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is the ONLY value of the square root!\u00a0 If we want the -4 then we do the following...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that I used parenthesis only to make the point on just how the minus sign was appearing!\u00a0 In general the middle two steps are omitted.\u00a0 So, if we want the negative value we have to actually put in the minus sign!...\u00a0...I suppose that this misconception arises because they are also asked to solve things like ....\u00a0 Clearly the answer to this is ...\u00a0and often they will solve by \u201ctaking the square root\u201d of both sides.\u00a0 There is a missing step however.\u00a0 Here is the proper solution technique for this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that the ...\u00a0shows up in the second step before we actually find the value of the square root!\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t show up as part of taking the square root....\u00a0...I feel that I need to point out that many instructors (including myself on occasion) don\u2019t help matters in that they will often omit the second step and by doing so seem to imply that the ...\u00a0is showing up because of the square root....\u00a0...So remember that square roots ALWAYS return a positive answer or zero.\u00a0 If you want a negative you\u2019ll need to put it in a minus sign BEFORE you take the square root....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is more a notational issue than an algebra issue.\u00a0 I decided to put it here because too many students come out of algebra classes without understanding this point.\u00a0 There are really three kinds of \u201cbad\u201d notation that people often use with fractions that can lead to errors in work....\u00a0...The first is using a \u201c/\u201d to denote a fraction, for instance 2/3.\u00a0 In this case there really isn\u2019t a problem with using a \u201c/\u201d, but what about 2/3...?\u00a0 This can be either of the two following fractions....\u00a0...\u00a0...It is not clear from 2/3... which of these two it should be!\u00a0 You, as the student, may know which one of the two that you intended it to be, but a grader won\u2019t.\u00a0 Also, while you may know which of the two you intended it to be when you wrote it down, will you still know which of the two it is when you go back to look at the problem when you study?...\u00a0...You should only use a \u201c/\u201d for fractions when it will be clear and obvious to everyone, not just you, how the fraction should be interpreted....\u00a0...The next notational problem I see fairly regularly is people writing ....\u00a0 It is not clear from this if the ... belongs in the denominator or the fraction or not.\u00a0 Students often write fractions like this and usually they mean that the ... shouldn\u2019t be in the denominator.\u00a0 The problem is on a quick glance it often looks like it should be in the denominator and the student just didn\u2019t draw the fraction bar over far enough....\u00a0...If you intend for the\u00a0...\u00a0 to be in the denominator then write it as such that way, ..., ... make sure that you draw the fraction bar over the WHOLE denominator.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t intend for it to be in the denominator then don\u2019t leave any doubt!\u00a0 Write it as .......\u00a0...The final notational problem that I see comes back to using a \u201c/\u201d to denote a fraction, but is really a parenthesis problem.\u00a0 This involves fractions like...\u00a0...\u00a0...Often students who use \u201c/\u201d to denote fractions will write this is fraction as...\u00a0...\u00a0...These students know that they are writing down the original fraction.\u00a0 However, almost anyone else will see the following...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is definitely NOT the original fraction.\u00a0 So, if you MUST use \u201c/\u201d to denote fractions use parenthesis to make it clear what is the numerator and what is the denominator.\u00a0 So, you should write it as...\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/CommonErrors/AlgebraErrors.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Common Math Errors - Algebra Errors", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In fact, that was the original title of this section, but I did not want to leave people with the feeling that I\u2019m trying to imply that math is easy and that everyone should just \u201cget it\u201d!\u00a0 For many people math is a very difficult subject and they will struggle with it.\u00a0 So please do not leave with the impression that I\u2019m trying to imply that math is easy for everyone.\u00a0 The intent of this section is to address certain attitudes and preconceptions many students have that can make a math class very difficult to successfully complete....\u00a0...\u00a0...I don\u2019t know how many students have come up to me and said something along the lines of :...\u00a0...\u201cI\u2019ve been putting this off for a while now because math is so hard for...me and now I\u2019ve got to have it in order to graduate this semester.\u201d...\u00a0...This has got to be one of the strangest attitudes that I\u2019ve ever run across.\u00a0 If math is hard for you, putting off your math requirements is one of the worst things that you can do!\u00a0 You should take your math requirements as soon as you can.\u00a0 There are several reasons for this....\u00a0...The first reason can be stated in the following way : MATH IS CUMULATIVE.\u00a0 In other words, most math classes build on knowledge you\u2019ve gotten in previous math classes, including your high school math classes.\u00a0 So, the only real effect of putting off your math requirement is that you forget the knowledge that you once had.\u00a0 It will be assumed that you\u2019ve still got this knowledge when you finally do take your math requirement!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If you put off your math requirement you will be faced with the unpleasant situation of having to learn new material AND relearn all the forgotten material at the same time.\u00a0 In most cases, this means that you will struggle in the class far more than if you had just taken it right away!...\u00a0...The second reason has nothing to do with knowledge (or the loss of knowledge), but instead has everything to do with reality.\u00a0 If math is hard for you and you struggle to pass a math course, then you really should take the course at a time that allows for the unfortunate possibility that you don\u2019t pass.\u00a0 In other words, to put it bluntly, if you wait until your last semester to take your required math course and fail you won\u2019t be graduating!\u00a0 Take it right away so if you do unfortunately fail the course you can retake it the next semester....\u00a0...This leads to the third reason.\u00a0 Too many students wait until the last semester to take their math class in the hopes that their instructor will take pity on them and not fail them because they\u2019re graduating.\u00a0 To be honest the only thing that I, and many other instructors, feel in these cases is irritation at being put into the position at having to be the bad guy and failing a graduating senior.\u00a0 Not a situation where you can expect much in the way of sympathy!...\u00a0...\u00a0...I see far too many students trying to do the bare minimum required to pass the class, or at least what they feel is the bare minimum required.\u00a0 The problem with this is they often underestimate the amount of work required early in the class, get behind, and then spend the rest of the semester playing catch up and having to do far more than just the bare minimum....\u00a0...You should always try to get the best grade possible!\u00a0 You might be surprised and do better than you expected.\u00a0 At the very least you will lessen the chances of underestimating the amount of work required and getting behind....\u00a0...Remember that math is NOT a spectator sport!\u00a0 You must be actively involved in the learning process if you want to do well in the class....\u00a0...\u00a0...Another heading here could be : \u201cDon\u2019t get cocky and don\u2019t despair\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 If you get a good score on the first exam do not decide that means that you don\u2019t need to work hard for the rest of the semester.\u00a0 All the good score means is that you\u2019re doing the proper amount of for studying for the class!\u00a0 Almost every semester I have a student get an A on the first class and end up with a C (or less) for the class because he/she got cocky and decided to not study as much and promptly started getting behind and doing poorly on exams....\u00a0...Likewise, if you get a bad score on the first exam do not despair!\u00a0 All the bad score means is that you need to do a little more work for the next exam.\u00a0 Work more problems, join a study group, or get a tutor to help you.\u00a0 Just as I have someone go downhill almost every semester I also have at least one student who fails the first exam and yet passes the class, often with a B and occasionally an A!...\u00a0...Your score on the first exam simply doesn\u2019t translate into a course grade.\u00a0 There is a whole semester in front of you and lots of opportunities to improve your grade so don\u2019t despair if you didn\u2019t do as well as you wanted to on the first exam....\u00a0...\u00a0...The first two are really problems that fall under the last topic but I run across them often enough that I thought I\u2019d go ahead and put them down as well.\u00a0 The reality is that most people simply don\u2019t know how to study mathematics. This is not because people are not capable of studying math, but because they\u2019ve never really learned how to study math....\u00a0...Mathematics is not like most subjects and accordingly you must also study math differently. This is an unfortunate reality and many students try to study for a math class in the same way that they would study for a history class, for example.\u00a0 This will inevitably lead to problems.\u00a0 In a history class you can, in many cases, simply attend class memorize a few names and/or dates and pass the class.\u00a0 In a math class things are different.\u00a0 Simply memorizing will not always get you through the class, you also need to understand HOW to use the formula that you\u2019ve memorized....\u00a0...This is such an important topic and there is so much to be said I\u2019ve devoted a whole document to just this topic.\u00a0 My ... can be accessed at,...\u00a0...\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/CommonErrors/GeneralErrors.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Common Math Errors - General Errors", "subject": "math"}},
