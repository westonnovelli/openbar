{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we will now take a look as solving logarithmic equations, or equations with logarithms in them.\u00a0 We will be looking at two specific types of equations here.\u00a0 In particular we will look at equations in which every term is a logarithm and we also look at equations in which all but one term in the equation is a logarithm and the term without the logarithm will be a constant.\u00a0 Also, we will be assuming that the logarithms in each equation will have the same base.\u00a0 If there is more than one base in the logarithms in the equation the solution process becomes much more difficult....\u00a0...Before we get into the solution process we will need to remember that we can only plug positive numbers into a logarithm.\u00a0 This will be important down the road and so we can\u2019t forget that....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s start off by looking at equations in which each term is a logarithm and all the bases on the logarithms are the same.\u00a0 In this case we will use the fact that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...In other words, if we\u2019ve got two logs in the problem, one on either side of an equal sign and both with a coefficient of one, then we can just drop the logarithms....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...With this equation there are only two logarithms in the   equation so it\u2019s easy to get on one either side of the equal sign.\u00a0 We will also need to deal with the   coefficient in front of the first term....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve got two logarithms with the same base and   coefficients of 1 on either side of the equal sign we can drop the logs and   solve....\u00a0...Now, we do need to worry if this solution will produce any   negative numbers or zeroes in the logarithms so the next step is to plug this   into the ... equation and see   if it does....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that we don\u2019t need to go all the way out with the   check here.\u00a0 We just need to make sure   that once we plug in the ... we don\u2019t   have any negative numbers or zeroes in the logarithms.\u00a0 Since we don\u2019t in this case we have the   solution, it is .......\u00a0... ...Okay, in this equation we\u2019ve got three logarithms and we   can only have two.\u00a0 So, we saw how to   do this kind of work in a set of examples in the previous ... so we just need to do the   same thing here.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t really   matter how we do this, but since one side already has one logarithm on it we   might as well combine the logs on the other side....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now we\u2019ve got one logarithm on either side of the equal   sign, they are the same base and have coefficients of one so we can drop the   logarithms and solve....\u00a0...Now, before we declare these to be solutions we MUST check   them in the original equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...No logarithms of negative numbers and no logarithms of   zero so this is a solution. ...\u00a0...\u00a0...We don\u2019t need to go any farther, there is a logarithm of a   negative number in the first term (the others are also negative) and that\u2019s   all we need in order to exclude this as a solution....\u00a0...Be careful here.\u00a0 We   are not excluding ...\u00a0because it is negative, that\u2019s not the   problem.\u00a0 We are excluding it because   once we plug it into the original equation we end up with logarithms of   negative numbers.\u00a0 It is possible to   have negative values of ... be   solutions to these problems, so don\u2019t mistake the reason for excluding this   value.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, along those lines we didn\u2019t take ...\u00a0as a solution because it was positive, but   because it didn\u2019t produce any negative numbers or zero in the logarithms upon   substitution.\u00a0 It is possible for   positive numbers to not be solutions....\u00a0...So, with all that out of the way, we\u2019ve got a single   solution to this equation, ....... ...We will work this equation in the same manner that we   worked the previous one.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got two   logarithms on one side so we\u2019ll combine those, drop the logarithms and then   solve....\u00a0...We\u2019ve got two possible solutions to check here....\u00a0...This one is okay....\u00a0...This one is also okay....\u00a0...In this case both possible solutions, ...\u00a0and ...,   end up actually being solutions.\u00a0 There   is no reason to expect to always have to throw one of the two out as a   solution....\u00a0...Now we need to take a look at the second kind of logarithmic equation that we\u2019ll be solving here.\u00a0 This equation will have all the terms but one be a logarithm and the one term that doesn\u2019t have a logarithm will be a constant....\u00a0...In order to solve these kinds of equations we will need to remember the exponential form of the logarithm.\u00a0 Here it is if you don\u2019t remember....\u00a0...\u00a0...We will be using this conversion to exponential form in all of these equations so it\u2019s important that you can do it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s work some examples so we can see how these kinds of equations can be solved....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...To solve these we need to get the equation into exactly   the form that this one is in.\u00a0 We need   a single log in the equation with a coefficient of one and a constant on the   other side of the equal sign.\u00a0 Once we   have the equation in this form we simply convert to exponential form....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s do that with this equation.\u00a0 The exponential form of this equation is,...\u00a0...Notice that this is an equation that we can easily solve....\u00a0...Now, just as with the first set of examples we need to   plug this back into the ...   equation and see if it will produce negative numbers or zeroes in the   logarithms.\u00a0 If it does it can\u2019t be a   solution and if it doesn\u2019t then it is a solution....\u00a0...\u00a0...Only positive numbers in the logarithm and so ...\u00a0is in fact a solution....\u00a0... ...In this case we\u2019ve got two logarithms in the problem so we   are going to have to combine them into a single logarithm as we did in the   first set of examples.\u00a0 Doing this for   this equation gives,...\u00a0...Now, that we\u2019ve got the equation into the proper form we   convert to exponential form.\u00a0 Recall as   well that we\u2019re dealing with the common logarithm here and so the base is 10....\u00a0...Here is the exponential form of this equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got two potential solutions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s check them both....\u00a0...We\u2019ve got negative numbers in the logarithms and so this can\u2019t   be a solution....\u00a0...No negative numbers or zeroes in the logarithms and so   this is a solution....\u00a0...Therefore, we have a single solution to this equation, .......\u00a0...Again, remember that we don\u2019t exclude a potential solution   because it\u2019s negative or include a potential solution because it\u2019s   positive.\u00a0 We exclude a potential   solution if it produces negative numbers or zeroes in the logarithms upon   substituting it into the equation and we include a potential solution if it   doesn\u2019t....\u00a0... ...Again, let\u2019s get the logarithms onto one side and combined   into a single logarithm....\u00a0...Now, convert it to exponential form....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s solve this equation....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s check both of these solutions in the original   equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, upon substituting this solution in we see that all the   numbers in the logarithms are positive and so this IS a solution.\u00a0 Note again that it doesn\u2019t matter that the   solution is negative, it just can\u2019t produce negative numbers or zeroes in the   logarithms....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case, despite the fact that the potential solution   is positive we get negative numbers in the logarithms and so it can\u2019t   possibly be a solution....\u00a0...Therefore, we get a single solution for this equation, .......\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveLogEqns.aspx", "media": "text",

the exception that each equation must have at least one variable in it....\u00a0...Also, the system is called linear if the variables are only to the first power, are only in the numerator and there are no products of variables in any of the equations....\u00a0...Here is an example of a system with numbers....\u00a0...Before we discuss how to solve systems we should first talk about just what a solution to a system of equations is.\u00a0 A solution to a system of equations is a value of ... and a value of ... that, when substituted into the equations, satisfies both equations at the same time....\u00a0...For the example above ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is a solution to the system.\u00a0 This is easy enough to check....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, sure enough that pair of numbers is a solution to

if you think about it both of the equations in the system are lines.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s graph them and see what we get....\u00a0...As you can see the solution to the system is the coordinates of the point where the two lines intersect.\u00a0 So, when solving linear systems with two variables we are really asking where the two lines will intersect....\u00a0...We will be looking at two methods for solving systems in this section....\u00a0...The first method is called the ....\u00a0 In this method we will solve one of the equations for one of the variables and substitute this into the other equation.\u00a0 This will yield one equation with one variable that we can solve.\u00a0 Once this is solved we substitute this value back into one of the equations to find the value of the remaining variable....\u00a0...In words this method is not always very clear.\u00a0 Let\u2019s work a couple of examples to see how this method works....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following systems....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...\u00a0...So, this was the first system that we looked at   above.\u00a0 We already know the solution,   but this will give us a chance to verify the values that we wrote down for   the solution....\u00a0...Now, the method says that we need to solve one of the   equations for one of the variables.\u00a0   Which equation we choose and which variable that we choose is up to   you, but it\u2019s usually best to pick an equation and variable that will be easy   to deal with.\u00a0 This means we should try   to avoid fractions if at all possible....\u00a0...In this case it looks like it will be really easy to solve   the first equation for ... so let\u2019s   do that....\u00a0...Now, substitute this into the second equation....\u00a0...This is an equation in ...   that we can solve so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...So, there is the ...   portion of the solution....\u00a0...Finally, do NOT forget to go back and find the ... portion of the solution.\u00a0 This is one of the more common mistakes   students make in solving systems.\u00a0 To   so this we can either plug the ...   value into one of the original equations and solve for ... or we can just plug it into our substitution that we found in   the first step.\u00a0 That will be easier so   let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the solution is ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0as we noted above....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...With this system we aren\u2019t going to be able to completely   avoid fractions.\u00a0 However, it looks   like if we solve the second equation for ...   we can minimize them.\u00a0 Here is that   work....\u00a0...Now, substitute this into the first equation and solve the   resulting equation for .......\u00a0...Finally, substitute this into the original substitution to   find .......\u00a0...So, the solution to this system is ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...As with single equations we could always go back and check this solution by plugging it into both equations and making sure that it does satisfy both equations.\u00a0 Note as well that we really would need to plug into both equations.\u00a0 It is quite possible that a mistake could result in a pair of numbers that would satisfy one of the equations but not the other one....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now move into the next method for solving systems of equations.\u00a0 As we saw in the last part of the previous example the method of substitution will often force us to deal with fractions, which adds to the likelihood of mistakes.\u00a0 This second method will not have this problem.\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s not completely true.\u00a0 If fractions are going to show up they will only show up in the final step and they will only show up if the solution contains fractions....\u00a0...This second method is called the ....\u00a0 In this method we multiply one or both of the equations by appropriate numbers (... multiply every term in the equation by the number) so that one of the variables will have the same coefficient with opposite signs.\u00a0 Then next step is to add the two equations together.\u00a0 Because one of the variables had the same coefficient with opposite signs it will be eliminated when we add the two equations.\u00a0 The result will be a single equation that we can solve for one of the variables.\u00a0 Once this is done substitute this answer back into one of the original equations....\u00a0...As with the first method it\u2019s much easier to see what\u2019s going on here with a couple of examples....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following systems of equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...\u00a0...This is the system in the previous set of examples that   made us work with fractions.\u00a0 Working   it here will show the differences between the two methods and it will also   show that either method can be used to get the solution to a system....\u00a0...So, we need to multiply one or both equations by constants   so that one of the variables has the same coefficient with opposite   signs.\u00a0 So, since the ... terms already have opposite signs   let\u2019s work with these terms.\u00a0 It looks   like if we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 the ... terms will have coefficients of 12   and -12 which is what we need for this method....\u00a0...Here is the work for this step....\u00a0...So, as the description of the method promised we have an   equation that can be solved for ....\u00a0 Doing this gives, ...\u00a0which is exactly what we found in the   previous example.\u00a0 Notice however, that   the only fraction that we had to deal with to this point is the answer itself   which is different from the method of substitution....\u00a0...Now, again don\u2019t forget to find ....\u00a0 In this case it will be   a little more work than the method of substitution.\u00a0 To find ...   we need to substitute the value of ...   into either of the original equations and solve for ....\u00a0 Since ... is a fraction let\u2019s notice that, in   this case, if we plug this value into the second equation we will lose the   fractions at least temporarily.\u00a0 Note   that often this won\u2019t happen and we\u2019ll be forced to deal with fractions   whether we want to or not....\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, this is the same value we found in the previous example....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...In this part all the variables are positive so we\u2019re going   to have to force an opposite sign by multiplying by a negative number   somewhere.\u00a0 Let\u2019s also notice that in   this case if we just multiply the first equation by -3 then the coefficients   of the ... will be -6 and 6....\u00a0...Sometimes we only need to multiply one of the equations   and can leave the other one alone.\u00a0   Here is this work for this part....\u00a0...Finally, plug this into either of the equations and solve   for ....\u00a0 We will use the first equation this time....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the solution to this system is ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...There is a third method that we\u2019ll be looking at to solve systems of two equations, but it\u2019s a little more complicated and is probably more useful for systems with at least three equations so we\u2019ll look at it in a later .......\u00a0...Before leaving this section we should address a couple of special case in solving systems....\u00a0...Solve   the following systems of equations....We can use either method here, but it looks like   substitution would probably be slightly easier.\u00a0 We\u2019ll solve the first equation for ... and substitute that into the second   equation....\u00a0...So, this is clearly not true and there doesn\u2019t appear to   be a mistake anywhere in our work.\u00a0 So,   what\u2019s the problem?\u00a0 To see let\u2019s graph   these two lines and see what we get....\u00a0...It appears that these two lines are parallel (can you   verify that with the slopes?) and we know that two parallel lines with   different ...-intercepts (that\u2019s   important) will never cross....\u00a0...As we saw in the opening discussion of this section   solutions represent the point where two lines intersect.\u00a0 If two lines don\u2019t intersect we can\u2019t have   a solution....\u00a0...So, when we get this kind of nonsensical answer from our   work we have two parallel lines and there is ... to this system of equations....\u00a0...The system in the previous example is called ....\u00a0 Note as well that if we\u2019d used elimination on this system we would have ended up with a similar nonsensical answer....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....In this example it looks like elimination would be the   easiest method....On first glance this might appear to be the same problem   as the previous example.\u00a0 However, in   that case we ended up with an equality that simply wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0 In this case we have 0=0 and that is a true   equality and so in that sense there is nothing wrong with this....\u00a0...However, this is clearly not what we were expecting for an   answer here and so we need to determine just what is going on.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave it to you to verify this, but if you find the   slope and ...-intercepts for these   two lines you will find that both lines have exactly the same slope and both   lines have exactly the same ...-intercept.\u00a0\u00a0 So, what does this mean for us?\u00a0 Well if two lines have the same slope and   the same ...-intercept then the   graphs of the two lines are the same graph.\u00a0   In other words, the graphs of these two lines are the same graph.\u00a0 In these cases any set of points that   satisfies one of the equations will also satisfy the other equation....\u00a0...Also, recall that the graph of an equation is nothing more   than the set of all points that satisfies the equation.\u00a0 In other words, there is an infinite set of   points that will satisfy this set of equations....\u00a0...In these cases we do want to write down something for a   solution.\u00a0 So what we\u2019ll do is solve   one of the equations for one of the variables (it doesn\u2019t matter which you   choose).\u00a0 We\u2019ll solve the first for .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Then, given any ...   we can find a ... and these two   numbers will form a solution to the system of equations.\u00a0 We usually denote this by writing the   solution as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So show that these give solutions let\u2019s work through a   couple of values of .......\u00a0...To show that this is a solution we need to plug it into   both equations in the system....So, ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is a solution to the system.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do another one real quick....\u00a0...Again we need to plug it into both equations in the system   to show that it\u2019s a solution....\u00a0...Sure enough ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is a solution....\u00a0...So, since there are an infinite number of possible ...\u2019s there must be an ... to this   system and they are given by,...\u00a0...Systems such as those in the previous examples are called .......\u00a0...We\u2019ve now seen all three possibilities for the solution to a system of equations.\u00a0 A system of equation will have either no solution, exactly one solution or infinitely many solutions.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SystemsTwoVrble.aspx", "media": "text",

(the first equation, although it isn\u2019t in standard form) and a ... (the second equation if we   solved for ...).\u00a0 As with the first example we can\u2019t use   elimination on this system so we will have to use substitution....\u00a0...The best way is to solve the second equation for either ... or ....\u00a0 Either one will give us   pretty much the same work so we\u2019ll solve for ... since that is probably the one that will make the equation look more   like those that we\u2019ve looked at in the past.\u00a0   In other words, the new equation will be in terms of ... and that is the variable that we are   used to seeing in equations....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...The first step towards solving this equation will be to   multiply the whole thing by ...   to clear out the denominators....\u00a0...Now, this is ... and we know how to solve those kinds of equations.\u00a0 If we define,...and the equation can be written as,...\u00a0...In terms of ...   this means that we have the following,...\u00a0...So, we have four possible values of ... and two of them are complex.\u00a0   To determine the values of ...   we can plug these into our substitution....\u00a0...\u00a0...For the complex solutions, notice that we made sure the ... was in the numerator.\u00a0 The for solutions are then,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Two of the solutions are real and so represent   intersection points of the graphs of these two equations.\u00a0 The other two are complex solutions and   while solutions will not represent intersection points of the curves....\u00a0...For reference purposes, here is a sketch of the two   curves....\u00a0...Note that there are only two intersection points of these   two graphs as suggested by the two real solutions.\u00a0 Complex solutions never represent intersections   of two curves....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....This time we have an ...   and a hyperbola.\u00a0 Neither one are in   standard form however....\u00a0...In the first two examples we\u2019ve used the substitution   method to solve the system and we can use that here as well.\u00a0 Let\u2019s notice however, that if we just add   the two equations we will eliminate the ...\u2019s   from the system so we\u2019ll do it that way....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is easy enough to solve for .......\u00a0...To determine the value(s) of the ...\u2019s we can substitute these into either of the equations.\u00a0 We will use the first since there won\u2019t be   any minus signs to worry about....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that for this system, unlike the previous examples,   each value of ... actually gave two   possible values of ....\u00a0 That means that there are in fact four   solutions.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This also means that there should be four intersection   points to the two curves.\u00a0 Here is a   sketch for verification.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/NonLinearSystems.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Nonlinear Systems", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "This is going to be a fairly short section in the sense that it\u2019s really only going to consist of a couple of examples to illustrate how to take the methods from the previous section and use them to solve a linear system with three equations and three variables.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started with an example....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....We are going to try and find values of ..., ...,   and a ... that will satisfy all three   equations at the same time.\u00a0 We are   going to use elimination to eliminate one of the variables from one of the   equations and two of the variables from another of the equations.\u00a0 The reason for doing this will be apparent   once we\u2019ve actually done it....\u00a0...The elimination method in this case will work a little   differently than with two equations.\u00a0   As with two equations we will multiply as many equations as we need to   so that if we start adding pairs of equations we can eliminate one of the   variables....\u00a0...In this case it looks like if we multiply the second   equation by 2 it will be fairly simple to eliminate the ... term from the second and third equation by adding the first   equation to both of them.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s   first multiply the second equation by two....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, with this new system we will replace the second   equation with the sum of the first and second equations and we will replace   the third equation with the sum of the first and third equations....\u00a0...Here is the resulting system of equations....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve eliminated one of the variables from two of the   equations.\u00a0 We now need to eliminate   either ... or ... from either the second or third equations.\u00a0 Again, we will use elimination to do   this.\u00a0 In this case we will multiply   the third equation by -5 since this will allow us to eliminate ... from this equation by adding the   second onto is....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, replace the third equation with the sum of the second   and third equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, at this point notice that the third equation can be   quickly solved to find that ....\u00a0 Once we know this we can plug this into the   second equation and that will give us an equation that we can solve for ... as follows....\u00a0...\u00a0...Finally, we can substitute both ... and ... into the first   equation which we can use to solve for ....\u00a0 Here is that work....\u00a0...So, the solution to this system is ...,   ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...That was a fair amount of work and in this case there was even less work than normal because in each case we only had to multiply a single equation to allow us to eliminate variables.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the next section we\u2019ll be looking at a third method for solving systems that is basically a shorthand method for what we did in the previous example.\u00a0 The work using that method will be messy as well, but it will be slightly easier to do once you get the hang of it....\u00a0...In the previous example all we did was use the method of elimination until we could start solving for the variables and then just back substitute known values of variables into previous equations to find the remaining unknown variables....\u00a0...Not every linear system with three equations and three variables uses the elimination method exclusively so let\u2019s take a look at another example where the substitution method is used, at least partially....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....Before we get started on the solution process do not get   excited about the fact that the second equation only has two variables in   it.\u00a0 That is a fairly common occurrence   when we have more than two equations in the system.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In fact, we\u2019re going to take advantage of the fact that it   only has two variables and one of them, the ..., has a coefficient of -1.\u00a0   This equation is easily solved for ...   to get,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...We can then   substitute this into the first and third equation as

...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, if you   think about it, this is just a system of two linear equations with two   variables (... and ...) and we know how to solve these   kinds of systems from our work in the previous section....\u00a0...First, we\u2019ll   need to do a little simplification of the system....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...The simplified   version looks just like the systems we were solving in the previous   section.\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s almost the   same.\u00a0 The variables this time are ... and

elimination to solve this   new system of two linear equations.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...If we wanted to   use the method of substitution we could easily solve the second equation for ... (you do see why it would be easiest   to solve the second equation for ...   right?) and substitute that into the first equation.\u00a0 This would allow us to find ... and we could then find both ... and .......\u00a0...However, to   make the point that often we use both methods in solving systems of three   linear equations let\u2019s use the method of elimination to solve the system of   two equations.\u00a0 We\u2019ll just need to   multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 5.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...We can now   easily solve for ... to get ....\u00a0 The coefficients on the second equation are   smaller so let\u2019s plug this into that equation and solve for ....\u00a0   Here is that work....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Finally, we   need to determine the value of ....\u00a0 This is very easy to do.\u00a0 Recall in the first step we used   substitution and in that step we used the following equation....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Since we know   the value of ... all we need to do is   plug that into this equation and get the value of .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that in   many cases where we used substitution on the very first step the equation   you\u2019ll have at this step will contain both ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s and so you   will need both values to get the third variable....\u00a0...Okay, to finish this example up here is the solution : ...,   ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...As we\u2019ve seen with the two examples above there are a variety of paths that we could choose to take when solving a system of three linear equations with three variables.\u00a0 That will always be the case.\u00a0 There is no one true path for solving these.\u00a0 However, having said that there is often a path that will allow you to avoid some of the mess that can arise in solving these types of systems.\u00a0 Once you work enough of these types of problems you\u2019ll start to get a feel for a \u201cgood\u201d path through the solution process that will (hopefully) avoid some of the mess....\u00a0...Interpretation of solutions in these cases is a little harder in some senses.\u00a0 All three of these equations in the examples above are equations of planes in three dimensional space and solution to this systems in the examples above is the one point that all three of the planes have in common....\u00a0...Note as well that it is completely possible to have no solutions to these systems or infinitely many systems as we saw in the previous section with systems of two equations.\u00a0 We will look at these cases once we have the next section out of the way....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SystemsThreeVrble.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Linear Systems with Three Variables", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In the first section in this chapter we saw that there were some special cases in the solution to systems of two equations.\u00a0 We saw that there didn\u2019t have to be a solution at all and that we could in fact have infinitely many solutions.\u00a0 In this section we are going to generalize this out to general systems of equations and we\u2019re going to look at how to deal with these cases when using augmented matrices to solve a system....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first give the following fact....\u00a0...Given any system of equations there are exactly three   possibilities for the solution....\u00a0...This is exactly what we found the possibilities to be when we were looking at two equations.\u00a0 It just turns out that it doesn\u2019t matter how many equations we\u2019ve got.\u00a0 There are still only these three possibilities....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see how we can identify the first and last possibility when we are using the augmented matrix method for solving.\u00a0 In the previous section we stated that we wanted to use the row operations to convert the augmented matrix into the following form,...depending upon the number of equations present in the system.\u00a0 It turns out that we should have added the qualifier, \u201cif possible\u201d to this instruction, because it isn\u2019t always possible to do this.\u00a0 In fact, if it isn\u2019t possible to put it into one of these forms then we will know that we are in either the first or last possibility for the solution to the system....\u00a0...Before getting into some examples let\u2019s first address how we knew what the solution was based on these forms of the augmented matrix.\u00a0 Let\u2019s work with the two equation case....\u00a0...Since,...is an augmented matrix we can always convert back to equations.\u00a0 Each row represents an equation and the first column is the coefficient of ... in the equation while the second column is the coefficient of the ... in the equation.\u00a0 The final column is the constant that will be on the right side of the equation....\u00a0...So, if we do that for this case we get,...and this is exactly what we said the solution was in the previous section....\u00a0...This idea of turning an augmented matrix back into equations will be important in the following examples....\u00a0...Speaking of which, let\u2019s go ahead and work a couple of examples.\u00a0 We will start out with the two systems of equations that we looked at in the first section that gave the special cases of the solutions....\u00a0...Use   augmented matrices to solve each of the following systems....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...Now, we\u2019ve ...   worked this one out so we know that there is no solution to this system.\u00a0 Knowing that let\u2019s see what the augmented   matrix method gives us when we try to use it....\u00a0...We\u2019ll start with the augmented matrix....Notice that we\u2019ve already got a 1 in the upper left corner   so we don\u2019t need to do anything with that.\u00a0   So, we next need to make the -2 into a 0....\u00a0...Now, the next step should be to get a 1 in the lower right   corner, but there is no way to do that without changing the zero in the lower   left corner.\u00a0 That\u2019s a problem, because   we must have a zero in that spot as well as a one in the lower right corner.\u00a0 What this tells us is that it isn\u2019t   possible to put this augmented matrix form....\u00a0...Now, go back to equations and see what we\u2019ve got in this   case....The first row just converts back into the first   equation.\u00a0 The second row however   converts back to nonsense.\u00a0 We know   this isn\u2019t true so that means that there is no solution.\u00a0 Remember, if we reach a point where we have   an equation that just doesn\u2019t make sense we have no solution....\u00a0...Note that if we\u2019d gotten ...we would have been okay since the last row would return   the equation ...\u00a0so don\u2019t get confused between this case and   what we actually got for this system....\u00a0... ...In this case we ...   from the first section that there are infinitely many solutions to this   system.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what we get when we   use the augmented matrix method for the solution....\u00a0...Here is the augmented matrix for this system....In this case we\u2019ll need to first get a 1 in the upper left   corner and there isn\u2019t going to be any easy way to do this that will avoid   fractions so we\u2019ll just divide the first row by 2....\u00a0...Now, we can get a zero in the lower left corner....\u00a0...Now, as with the first part we are never going to be able   to get a 1 in place of the red zero without changing the first zero in that   row.\u00a0 However, this isn\u2019t the nonsense   that the first part got.\u00a0 Let\u2019s convert   back to equations....\u00a0...That last equation is a true equation and so there isn\u2019t   anything wrong with this.\u00a0 In this case   we have infinitely many solutions.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Recall that we still need to do a little work to get the   solution.\u00a0 We solve one of the equations   for one of the variables.\u00a0 Note   however, that if we use the equation from the augmented matrix this is very   easy to do....\u00a0...We then write the solution as,...\u00a0...We get solutions by picking ... and plugging this into the equation for ....\u00a0 Note that this is NOT   the same set of equations we got in the first section.\u00a0 That is okay.\u00a0 When there are infinitely many solutions   there are more than one way to write the equations that will describe all the   solutions....\u00a0...Let\u2019s summarize what we learned in the previous set of examples.\u00a0 First, if we have a row in which all the entries except for the very last one are zeroes and the last entry is NOT zero then we can stop and the system will have no solution....\u00a0...Next, if we get a row of all zeroes then we will have infinitely many solutions.\u00a0 We will then need to do a little more work to get the solution and the number of equations will determine how much work we need to do....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see how some systems with three equations work.\u00a0 The no solution case will be identical, but the infinite solution case will have a little work to do....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations using augmented matrices....Here\u2019s the augmented matrix for this system....We can get a 1 in the upper left corner by dividing by the   first row by a 3....\u00a0...Next we\u2019ll get the two numbers under this one to be   zeroes....\u00a0...And we can stop.\u00a0   The middle row is all zeroes except for the final entry which isn\u2019t   zero.\u00a0 Note that it doesn\u2019t matter what   the number is as long as it isn\u2019t zero....\u00a0...Once we reach this type of row we know that the system   won\u2019t have any solutions and so there isn\u2019t any reason to go any farther....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s see how we solve a system of three equations with an infinity number of solutions with the augmented matrix method.\u00a0 This example will also illustrate an interesting idea about systems....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations using augmented matrices....Notice that this system is almost identical to the system   in the previous example.\u00a0 The only   difference is the number to the right of the equal sign in the second   equation.\u00a0 In this system it is -2 and   in the previous example it was 10.\u00a0   Changing that one number completely changes the type of solution that   we\u2019re going to get.\u00a0 Often this kind of   simple change won\u2019t affect the type of solution that we get, but in some rare   cases it can....\u00a0...Since the first two steps of the process are identical to   the previous part we won\u2019t discuss them.\u00a0   Here they are....\u00a0...We\u2019ve got a row of all zeroes so we instantly know that   we\u2019ve got infinitely many solutions.\u00a0   Unlike the two equation case we aren\u2019t going to stop however.\u00a0 It looks like with a couple of row   operations we can make the second column look like it is supposed to in the   final form so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...In this case we were able to make the second column look   like it\u2019s supposed to and the third column will never look correct.\u00a0 However, it is possible that the situation   could be reversed and it would be the third column that we can make look   correct and the second wouldn\u2019t look correct.\u00a0   Every system is different....\u00a0...Once we reach this point we go back to equations....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, both of these equations contain a ... and so we\u2019ll move that to the other   side in each equation....\u00a0...This means that we get to pick the value of ... for free and we\u2019ll write the   solution as,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Since there are an infinite number of ways to choose ... there are an infinite number of   solutions to this system.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/AugmentedMatrixII.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this final section of this chapter we need to look at some applications of exponential and logarithm functions....\u00a0...This first application is compounding interest and there are actually two separate formulas that we\u2019ll be looking at here.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first get those out of the way....\u00a0...If we were to put ... dollars into an account that earns interest at a rate of ... (written as a decimal) for ... years (yes, it must be years) then,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dollars after ...

invest $100,000 in an account that earns interest at a rate of   7.5% for 54 months.\u00a0 Determine how much   money will be in the account if,...interest   is compounded quarterly.\u00a0\u00a0 ...interest   is compounded monthly.\u00a0\u00a0 ...interest   is compounded continuously.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before getting into each part let\u2019s identify the   quantities that we will need in all the parts and won\u2019t change....Remember that interest rates must be decimals for these   computations and ... must be in   years!\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s work the problems....\u00a0... ...\u00a0\u00a0...In this part the interest is compounded quarterly and that   means it is compounded 4 times a year.\u00a0   After 54 months we then have,...\u00a0...Notice the amount of decimal places used here.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t do any rounding until the very   last step.\u00a0 It is important to not do   too much rounding in intermediate steps with these problems....\u00a0... ...Here we are compounding monthly and so that means we are   compounding 12 times a year.\u00a0 Here is   how much we\u2019ll have after 54 months....\u00a0...So, compounding more times per year will yield more money....\u00a0... ...Finally, if we compound continuously then after 54 months   we will have,...\u00a0...Now, as pointed out in the first part of this example it is important to not round too much before the final answer.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go back and work the first part again and this time let\u2019s round to three decimal places at each step....\u00a0...\u00a0...This answer is off from the correct answer by $593.31 and that\u2019s a fairly large difference.\u00a0 So, how many decimal places should we keep in these?\u00a0 Well, unfortunately the answer is that it depends.\u00a0 The larger the initial amount the more decimal places we will need to keep around.\u00a0 As a general rule of thumb, set your calculator to the maximum number of decimal places it can handle and take all of them until the final answer and then round at that point....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now look at a different kind of example with compounding interest....\u00a0...We   are going to put $2500 into an account that earns interest at a rate of   12%.\u00a0 If we want to have $4000 in the   account when we close it how long should we keep the money in the account if,...we   compound interest continuously.\u00a0\u00a0 ...we   compound interest 6 times a year.\u00a0\u00a0 ...Again, let\u2019s identify the quantities that won\u2019t change   with each part....\u00a0...Notice that this time we\u2019ve been given ... and are asking to find ....\u00a0   This means that we are going to have to solve an exponential equation   to get at the answer....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s first set up the equation that we\u2019ll need to solve....\u00a0...Now, we saw how to solve these kinds of equations a couple   of ....\u00a0 In that section we saw that we need to get   the exponential on one side by itself with a coefficient of 1 and then take   the natural logarithm of both sides.\u00a0   Let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...We need to keep the amount in the account for 3.917 years   to get $4000....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Again, let\u2019s first set up the equation that we need to   solve....\u00a0...We will solve this the same way that we solved the   previous part.\u00a0 The work will be a   little messier, but for the most part it will be the same....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case we need to keep the amount slightly longer to   reach $4000....\u00a0...There are many quantities out there in the world that are governed (at least for a short time period) by the equation,...where ...\u00a0is positive and is the amount initially present at ...\u00a0and ... is a non-zero constant.\u00a0 If ... is positive then the equation will grow without bound and is called the ... equation.\u00a0 Likewise, if ... is negative the equation will die down to zero and is called the ... equation....\u00a0...Short term population growth is often modeled by the exponential growth equation and the decay of a radioactive element is governed the exponential decay equation....\u00a0...The   growth of a colony of bacteria is given by the equation,...If there are initially 500 bacteria present and ... is given in hours determine each of   the following....How   many bacteria are there after a half of a day?\u00a0\u00a0 ...How   long will it take before there are 10000 bacteria in the colony?\u00a0\u00a0 ...Here is the equation for this starting amount of bacteria.... ...In this case if we want the number of bacteria after half   of a day we will need to use ...\u00a0since ...   is in hours.\u00a0 So, to get the answer to   this part we just need to plug ...   into the equation....So, since a fractional population doesn\u2019t make much sense we\u2019ll   say that after half of a day there are 5190 of the bacteria present....\u00a0... ...Do NOT make the mistake of assuming that it will be approximately   1 day for this answer based on the answer to the previous part.\u00a0 With exponential growth things just don\u2019t   work that way as we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 In order   to answer this part we will need to solve the following exponential equation....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...So, it only takes approximately 15.4 hours to reach 10000   bacteria and NOT 24 hours if we just double the time from the first   part.\u00a0 In other words, be careful!...\u00a0...Carbon   14 dating works by measuring the amount of Carbon 14 (a radioactive element)   that is in a fossil.\u00a0 All living things   have a constant level of Carbon 14 in them and once they die it starts to   decay according to the formula,...where ... is in   years and ...\u00a0is the amount of Carbon 14 present at death   and for this example let\u2019s assume that there will be 100 milligrams present   at death....How   much Carbon 14 will there be after 1000 years?\u00a0\u00a0 ...How   long will it take for half of the Carbon 14 to decay?\u00a0\u00a0 ... ...In this case all we need to do is plug in\u00a0 ...   into the equation....\u00a0...So, it looks like we will have around 88.338 milligrams   left after 1000 years....\u00a0... ...So, we want to know how long it will take until there is   50 milligrams of the Carbon 14 left.\u00a0   That means we will have to solve the following equation,...\u00a0...Here is that work....\u00a0...So, it looks like it will take about 5589.897 years for   half of the Carbon 14 to decay.\u00a0 This   number is called the ... of   Carbon 14....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now looked at a couple of applications of exponential equations and we should now look at a quick application of a logarithm....\u00a0...The ... is commonly used to measure the intensity of an earthquake.\u00a0 There are many different ways of computing this based on a variety of different quantities.\u00a0 We are going to take a quick look at the formula that uses the energy released during an earthquake....\u00a0...If ... is the energy released, measured in joules, during an earthquake then the magnitude of the earthquake is given by,...where ...\u00a0joules....\u00a0...If   ...\u00a0joules of energy is released during an   earthquake what was the magnitude of the earthquake?...\u00a0...There really isn\u2019t much to do here other than to plug into   the formula....\u00a0...So, it looks like we\u2019ll have a magnitude of about 7....\u00a0...How   much energy will be released in an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9?...\u00a0...In this case we will need to solve the following equation....We saw how solve these kinds of equations in the previous ....\u00a0   First we need the logarithm on one side by itself with a coefficient   of one.\u00a0 Once we have it in that form   we convert to exponential form and solve....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, it looks like

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Now that we\u2019ve seen the definitions of exponential and logarithm functions we need to start thinking about how to solve equations involving them.\u00a0 In this section we will look at solving exponential equations and we will look at solving logarithm equations in the next section....\u00a0...There are two methods for solving exponential equations.\u00a0 One method is fairly simple, but requires a very special form of the exponential equation.\u00a0 The other will work on more complicated exponential equations, but can be a little messy at times.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off by looking at the simpler method.\u00a0 This method will use the following fact about exponential functions....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that this fact does require that the base in both exponentials to be the same.\u00a0 If it isn\u2019t then this fact will do us no good.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...In this first part we have the same base on both   exponentials so there really isn\u2019t much to do other than to set the two   exponents equal to each other and solve for .......So, if we were to plug ...\u00a0into the equation then we would get the same   number on both sides of the equal sign....\u00a0... ...Again, there really isn\u2019t much to do here other than set   the exponents equal since the base is the same in both exponentials....\u00a0...In this case we get two solutions to the equation.\u00a0 That is perfectly acceptable so don\u2019t worry   about it when it happens....\u00a0... ...Now, in this case we don\u2019t have the same base so we can\u2019t   just set exponents equal.\u00a0 However,   with a little manipulation of the right side we can get the same base on both   exponents.\u00a0 To do this all we need to   notice is that ....\u00a0 Here\u2019s what we get when we use this fact....Now, we still can\u2019t just set exponents equal since the   right side now has two exponents. If we recall our exponent properties we can   fix this however....\u00a0...We now have the same base and a single exponent on each   base so we can use the property and set the exponents equal.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...So, after all that work we get a solution of .......\u00a0... ...In this part we\u2019ve got some issues with both sides.\u00a0 First the right side is a fraction and the   left side isn\u2019t.\u00a0 That is not the   problem that it might appear to be however, so for a second let\u2019s ignore   that.\u00a0 The real issue here is that we   can\u2019t write 8 as a power of 4 and we can\u2019t write 4 as a power of 8 as we did   in the previous part....\u00a0...The first thing to do in this problem is to get the same   base on both sides and to so that we\u2019ll have to note that we can write both 4   and 8 as a power of 2.\u00a0 So let\u2019s do   that....\u00a0...It\u2019s now time to take care of the fraction on the right   side.\u00a0 To do this we simply need to   remember the following exponent property....Using this gives,...\u00a0...So, we now have the same base and each base has a single   exponent on it so we can set the exponents equal....And there is the answer to this part....\u00a0...Now, the equations in the previous set of examples all relied upon the fact that we were able to get the same base on both exponentials, but that just isn\u2019t always possible.\u00a0 Consider the following equation....This is a fairly simple equation however the method we used in the previous examples just won\u2019t work because we don\u2019t know how to write 9 as a power of 7.\u00a0 In fact, if you think about it that is exactly what this equation is asking us to find....\u00a0...So, the method we used in the first set of examples won\u2019t work.\u00a0 The problem here is that the ... is in the exponent.\u00a0 Because of that all our knowledge about solving equations won\u2019t do us any good.\u00a0 We need a way to get the ... out of the exponent and luckily for us we have a way to do that.\u00a0 Recall the following logarithm property from the last section....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that to avoid confusion with ...\u2019s we replaced the ... in this property with an ....\u00a0 The important part of this property is that we can take an exponent and move it into the front of the term....\u00a0...So, if we had,...we could use this property as follows....The ... in now out of the exponent!\u00a0 Of course we are now stuck with a logarithm in the problem and not only that but we haven\u2019t specified the base of the logarithm....\u00a0...The reality is that we can use any logarithm to do this so we should pick one that we can deal with.\u00a0 This usually means that we\u2019ll work with the common logarithm or the natural logarithm....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s work a set of examples to see how we actually use this idea to solve these equations....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...Okay, so we say above that if we had a logarithm in front   the left side we could get the ...   out of the exponent.\u00a0 That\u2019s easy   enough to do.\u00a0 We\u2019ll just put a   logarithm in front of the left side.\u00a0   However, if we put a logarithm there we also must put a logarithm in   front of the right side.\u00a0 This is   commonly referred to as .......\u00a0...We can use any logarithm that we\u2019d like to so let\u2019s try   the natural logarithm....\u00a0...Now, we need to solve for ....\u00a0 This is easier than it   looks.\u00a0 If we had ...\u00a0then we could all solve for ... simply by dividing both sides by   7.\u00a0 It works in exactly the same manner   here.\u00a0 Both ln7 and ln9 are just   numbers.\u00a0 Admittedly, it would take a   calculator to determine just what those numbers are, but they are numbers and   so we can do the same thing here....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, that is technically the exact answer.\u00a0 However, in this case it\u2019s usually best to   get a decimal answer so let\u2019s go one step further....\u00a0...Note that the answers to these are decimal answers more often   than not....\u00a0...Also, be careful here to not make the following mistake....\u00a0...The two are clearly different numbers....\u00a0...Finally, let\u2019s also use the common logarithm to make sure   that we get the same answer....\u00a0...So, sure enough the same answer.\u00a0 We can use either logarithm, although there   are times when it is more convenient to use one over the other....\u00a0... ...In this case we can\u2019t just put a logarithm in front of   both sides.\u00a0 There are two reasons for   this.\u00a0 First on the right side we\u2019ve   got a zero and we know from the previous section that we can\u2019t take the logarithm   of zero.\u00a0 Next, in order to move the   exponent down it has to be on the whole term inside the logarithm and that   just won\u2019t be the case with this equation in its present form....\u00a0...So, the first step is to move on of the terms to the other   side of the equal sign, then we will take the logarithm of both sides using   the natural logarithm....\u00a0...\u00a0...Okay, this looks messy, but again, it\u2019s really not that   bad.\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at the following   equation first....We can all solve this equation and so that means that we   can solve the one that we\u2019ve got.\u00a0   Again the ln2 and ln3 are just numbers and so the process is exactly   the same.\u00a0 The answer will be messier   than this equation, but the process is identical.\u00a0 Here is the work for this one....\u00a0...So, we get all the terms with ... in them on one side and all the other terms on the other   side.\u00a0 Once this is done we then factor   out a ... and divide by the   coefficient.\u00a0 Again, we would prefer a   decimal answer so let\u2019s get that....\u00a0... ...Now, this one is a little easier than the previous   one.\u00a0 Again, we\u2019ll take the natural   logarithm of both sides....\u00a0...Notice that we didn\u2019t take the exponent out of this   one.\u00a0 That is because we want to use   the following property with this one....\u00a0...We saw this in the previous section (in more general form)   and by using this here we will make our life significantly easier.\u00a0 Using this property gives,...\u00a0...Notice the parenthesis around the 2 in the logarithm this   time.\u00a0 They are there to make sure that   we don\u2019t make the following mistake....\u00a0...\u00a0...Be very careful with this mistake.\u00a0 It is easy to make when you aren\u2019t paying   attention to what you\u2019re doing or are in a hurry....\u00a0... ...The equation in this part is similar to the previous part   except this time we\u2019ve got a base of 10 and so recalling the fact that,...it makes more sense to use common logarithms this time   around....\u00a0...Here is the work for this equation....\u00a0...This could have been done with natural logarithms but the   work would have been messier....\u00a0... ...With this final equation we\u2019ve got a couple of   issues.\u00a0 First we\u2019ll need to move the   number over to the other side.\u00a0 In   order to take the logarithm of both sides we need to have the exponential on   one side by itself.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Next, we\u2019ve got to get a coefficient of 1 on the   exponential.\u00a0 We can only use the facts   to simplify this if there isn\u2019t a coefficient on the exponential.\u00a0 So, divide both sides by 5 to get,...\u00a0...At this point we will take the logarithm of both sides   using the natural logarithm since there is an ... in the equation....\u00a0...Note that we could have used this second method on the first set of examples as well if we\u2019d wanted to although the work would have been more complicated and prone to mistakes if we\u2019d done that.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveExpEqns.aspx", "media": "text", "title":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we need to take a look at the third method for solving systems of equations.\u00a0 For systems of two equations it is probably a little more complicated than the methods we looked at in the first section.\u00a0 However, for systems with more equations it is probably easier than using the method we saw in the previous section. ...\u00a0...Before we get into the method we first need to get some definitions out of the way....\u00a0...An ... for a system of equations is a matrix of numbers in which each row represents the constants from one equation (both the coefficients and the constant on the other side of the equal sign) and each column represents all the coefficients for a single variable....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at an example.\u00a0 Here is the system of equations that we looked at in the previous section....\u00a0...Here is the augmented matrix for this system....\u00a0...\u00a0...The first row consists of all the constants from the first equation with the coefficient of the ... in the first column, the coefficient of the ... in the second column, the coefficient of the ... in the third column and the constant in the final column.\u00a0 The second row is the constants from the second equation with the same placement and likewise for the third row.\u00a0 The dashed line represents where the equal sign was in the original system of equations and is not always included.\u00a0 This is mostly dependent on the instructor and/or textbook being used....\u00a0...Next we need to discuss ....\u00a0 There are three of them and we will give both the notation used for each one as well as an example using the augmented matrix given above....\u00a0...So, we do exactly what the operation says.\u00a0 Every entry in the third row moves up to the first row and every entry in the first row moves down to the third row.\u00a0 Make sure that you move all the entries.\u00a0 One of the more common mistakes is to forget to move one or more entries....\u00a0...So, when we say we will multiply a row by a constant this really means that we will multiply every entry in that row by the constant.\u00a0 Watch out for signs in this operation and make sure that you multiply every entry....\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s go through the individual computation to make sure you followed this....Be very careful with signs here.\u00a0 We will be doing these computations in our head for the most part and it is very easy to get signs mixed up and add one in that doesn\u2019t belong or lose one that should be there....\u00a0...It is very important that you can do this operation as this operation is the one that we will be using more than the other two combined....\u00a0...Okay, so how do we use augmented matrices and row operations to solve systems?\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with a system of two equations and two unknowns....\u00a0...We first write down the augmented matrix for this system,...and use elementary row operations to convert it into the following augmented matrix....Once we have the augmented matrix in this form we are done.\u00a0 The solution to the system will be ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...This method is called ... .......\u00a0...Solve   each of the following systems of equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...The first step here is to write down the augmented matrix   for this system....To convert it into the final form we will start in the   upper left corner and the work in a counter-clockwise direction until the   first two columns appear as they should be.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...So, the first step is to make the red three in the   augmented matrix above into a 1.\u00a0 We   can use any of the row operations that we\u2019d like to.\u00a0 We should always try to minimize the work   as much as possible however....\u00a0...So, since there is a one in the first column already it   just isn\u2019t in the correct row let\u2019s use the first row operation and   interchange the two rows....\u00a0...The next step is to get a zero below the 1 that we just   got in the upper left hand corner.\u00a0   This means that we need to change the red three into a zero.\u00a0 This will almost always require us to use   third row operation.\u00a0 If we add -3   times row 1 onto row 2 we can convert that 3 into a 0.\u00a0 Here is that operation....\u00a0...Next we need to get a 1 into the lower right corner of the   first two columns.\u00a0 This means changing   the red -11 into a 1.\u00a0 This is usually   accomplished with the second row operation.\u00a0   If we divide the second row by -11 we will get the 1 in that spot that   we need....\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019re almost done.\u00a0   The final step is to turn the red three into a zero. \u00a0Again, this almost always requires the third   row operation.\u00a0 Here is the operation   for this final step....\u00a0...We have the augmented matrix in the required form and so   we\u2019re done.\u00a0 The solution to this   system is ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...In this part we won\u2019t put in as much explanation for each   step.\u00a0 We will mark the next number   that we need to change in red as we did in the previous part....\u00a0...We\u2019ll first write down the augmented matrix and then get   started with the row operations....\u00a0...Before proceeding with the next step let\u2019s notice that in   the second matrix we had one\u2019s in both spots that we needed them.\u00a0 However, the only way to change the -2 into   a zero that we had to have as well was to also change the 1 in the lower   right corner as well.\u00a0\u00a0 This is okay.\u00a0 Sometimes it will happen and trying to keep   both ones will only cause problems....\u00a0...Let\u2019s finish the problem....\u00a0...The solution to this system is then ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s first write down the augmented matrix for this   system....Now, in this case there isn\u2019t a 1 in the first column and   so we can\u2019t just interchange two rows as the first step.\u00a0 However, notice that since all the entries   in the first row have 3 as a factor we can divide the first row by 3 which   will get a 1 in that spot and we won\u2019t put any fractions into the problem....\u00a0...Here is the work for this system....\u00a0...The solution to this system is ...\u00a0and ... .......\u00a0...It is important to note that the path we took to get the augmented matrices in this example into the final form is not the only path that we could have used.\u00a0\u00a0 There are many different paths that we could have gone down.\u00a0 All the paths would have arrived at the same final augmented matrix however so we should always choose the path that we feel is the easiest path.\u00a0 Note as well that different people may well feel that different paths are easier and so may well solve the systems differently.\u00a0 They will get the same solution however....\u00a0...For two equations and two unknowns this process is probably a little more complicated than just the straight forward solution process we used in the first section of this chapter.\u00a0 This process does start becoming useful when we start looking at larger systems.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of systems with three equations in them....\u00a0...In this case the process is basically identical except that there\u2019s going to be more to do.\u00a0 As with two equations we will first set up the augmented matrix and then use row operations to put it into the form,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Once the augmented matrix is in this form the solution is ..., ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 As with the two equations case there really isn\u2019t any set path to take in getting the augmented matrix into this form.\u00a0 The usual path is to get the 1\u2019s in the correct places and 0\u2019s below them.\u00a0 Once this is done we then try to get zeroes above the 1\u2019s....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples to see how this works....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following systems of equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s first write down the augmented matrix for this   system....As with the previous examples we will mark the number(s)   that we want to change in a given step in red.\u00a0 The first step here is to get a 1 in the   upper left hand corner and again, we have many ways to do this.\u00a0 In this case we\u2019ll notice that if we   interchange the first and second row we can get a 1 in that spot with   relatively little work....\u00a0...The next step is to get the two numbers below this 1 to be   0\u2019s.\u00a0 Note as well that this will   almost always require the third row operation to do.\u00a0 Also, we can do both of these in one step   as follows....\u00a0...Next we want to turn the 7 into a 1.\u00a0 We can do this by dividing the second row   by 7....\u00a0...So, we got a fraction showing up here.\u00a0 That will happen on occasion so don\u2019t get all   that excited about it.\u00a0 The next step   is to change the 3 below this new 1 into a 0.\u00a0   Note that we aren\u2019t going to bother with the -2 above it quite yet.\u00a0 Sometimes it is just as easy to turn this   into a 0 in the same step.\u00a0 In this   case however, it\u2019s probably just as easy to do it later as we\u2019ll see....\u00a0...So, using the third row operation we get,...\u00a0...Next, we need to get the number in the bottom right corner   into a 1.\u00a0 We can do that with the   second row operation....\u00a0...Now, we need zeroes above this new 1.\u00a0 So, using the third row operation twice as   follows will do what we need done....\u00a0...Notice that in this case the final column didn\u2019t change in   this step.\u00a0 That was only because the final   entry in that column was zero.\u00a0 In   general, this won\u2019t happen....\u00a0...The final step is then to make the -2 above the 1 in the   second column into a zero.\u00a0 This can   easily be done with the third row operation....\u00a0...So, we have the augmented matrix in the final form and the   solution will be,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This can be verified by plugging these into all three   equations and making sure that they are all satisfied....\u00a0... ...Again, the first step is to write down the augmented   matrix....\u00a0...We can\u2019t get a 1 in the upper left corner simply by   interchanging rows this time.\u00a0 We could   interchange the first and last row, but that would also require another   operation to turn the -1 into a 1.\u00a0   While this isn\u2019t difficult it\u2019s two operations.\u00a0 Note that we could use the third row   operation to get a 1 in that spot as follows....\u00a0...Now, we can use the third row operation to turn the two   red numbers into zeroes....\u00a0...The next step is to get a 1 in the spot occupied by the   red 4.\u00a0 We could do that by dividing   the whole row by 4, but that would put in a couple of somewhat unpleasant   fractions.\u00a0 So, instead of doing that   we are going to interchange the second and third row.\u00a0 The reason for this will be apparent soon   enough....\u00a0...Now, if we divide the second row by -2 we get the 1 in   that spot that we want....\u00a0...Before moving onto the next step let\u2019s think notice a   couple of things here.\u00a0 First, we   managed to avoid fractions, which is always a good thing, and second this row   is now done.\u00a0 We would have eventually   needed a zero in that third spot and we\u2019ve got it there for free.\u00a0 Not only that, but it won\u2019t change in any   of the later operations.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t   always happen, but if it does that will make our life easier....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s use the third row operation to change the red 4   into a zero....\u00a0...We now can divide the third row by 7 to get that the   number in the lower right corner into a one....\u00a0...Next, we can use the third row operation to get the -3   changed into a zero....\u00a0...The final step is to then make the -1 into a 0 using the   third row operation again....\u00a0...The solution to this system is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Using Gauss-Jordan elimination to solve a system of three equations can be a lot of work, but it is often no more work than solving directly and is many cases less work.\u00a0 If we were to do a system of four equations (which we aren\u2019t going to do) at that point Gauss-Jordan elimination would be less work in all likelihood that if we solved directly....\u00a0...Also, as we saw in the final example worked in this section, there really is no one set path to take through these problems.\u00a0 Each system is different and may require a different path and set of operations to make.\u00a0 Also, the path that one person finds to be the easiest may not by the path that another person finds to be the easiest.\u00a0 Regardless of the path however, the final answer will be the same.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/AugmentedMatrix.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online

However, despite these differences these functions evaluate in exactly the same way as those that we are used to.\u00a0 We will see some examples of exponential functions shortly....\u00a0...Before we get too far into this section we should address the restrictions on ....\u00a0 We avoid one and zero because in this case the function would be,...and these are constant functions and won\u2019t have many of the same properties that general exponential functions have....\u00a0...Next, we avoid negative numbers so that we don\u2019t get any complex values out of the function evaluation.\u00a0 For

of exponential functions from these graphs....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0on the same axis system....\u00a0...Okay, since we don\u2019t have any knowledge on what these

We will start by trying to determine the partial fraction decomposition of,...where both ... and ... are polynomials and the degree of ... is smaller than the degree of ....\u00a0\u00a0 Partial fractions can only be done if the degree of the numerator is strictly less than the degree of the denominator.\u00a0 That is important to remember....\u00a0...So, once we\u2019ve determined that partial fractions can be done we factor the denominator as completely as possible.\u00a0 Then for each factor in the denominator we can use the following table to determine the term(s) we pick up in the partial fraction decomposition....\u00a0...Factor in...denominator...Term in partial...fraction   decomposition...\u00a0...Notice that the first and third cases are really special cases of the second and fourth cases respectively if we let ....\u00a0 Also, it will always be possible to factor any polynomial down into a product of linear factors (...) and quadratic factors (...) some of which may be raised to a power....\u00a0...There are several methods for determining the coefficients for each term and we will go over each of those as we work the examples.\u00a0 Speaking of which, let\u2019s get started on some examples....\u00a0...Determine   the partial fraction decomposition of each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...We\u2019ll go through the first one in great detail to show the   complete partial fraction process and then we\u2019ll leave most of the   explanation out of the remaining parts....\u00a0... ...The first thing to do is factor the denominator as much as   we can....\u00a0...So, by comparing to the table above it looks like the   partial fraction decomposition must look like,...Note that we\u2019ve got different coefficients for each term   since there is no reason to think that they will be the same.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we need to determine the values of ... and ....\u00a0 The first step is to   actually add the two terms back up.\u00a0   This is usually simpler than it might appear to be.\u00a0 Recall that we first need the least common   denominator, but we\u2019ve already got that from the original rational   expression.\u00a0 In this case it is,...Now, just look at each term and compare the denominator to   the LCD.\u00a0 Multiply the numerator and   denominator by whatever is missing then add.\u00a0   In this case this gives,...\u00a0...We need values of ...   and ... so that the numerator of the   expression on the left is the same as the numerator of the term on the   right.\u00a0 Or,...This needs to be true regardless of the ... that we plug into this   equation.\u00a0 As noted above there are   several ways to do this.\u00a0 One way will   always work, but can be messy and will often require knowledge that we don\u2019t   have yet.\u00a0 The other way will not   always work, but when it does it will greatly reduce the amount of work   required....\u00a0...In this set of examples the second (and easier) method   will always work so we\u2019ll be using that here.\u00a0   Here we are going to make use of the fact that this equation must be true   regardless of the ... that we plug   in.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So let\u2019s pick an ...,   plug it in and see what happens.\u00a0 For   no apparent reason let\u2019s try plugging in ....\u00a0\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Can you see why we choose this number?\u00a0 By choosing ...\u00a0we got the term involving ... to drop out and we were left with a   simple equation that we can solve for .......\u00a0...Now, we could also choose ...\u00a0for exactly the same reason.\u00a0 Here is what happens if we use this value   of .......\u00a0...So, by correctly picking ... we were able to quickly and easily get the values of ... and ....\u00a0 So, all that we need to   do at this point is plug them in to finish the problem.\u00a0 Here is the partial fraction decomposition   for this part....\u00a0...Notice that we moved the minus sign on the second term   down to make the addition a subtraction.\u00a0   We will always do that....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Okay, in this case we won\u2019t put quite as much detail into   the problem.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first factor the   denominator and then get the form of the partial fraction decomposition....\u00a0...In this case the LCD is ...\u00a0and so adding the two terms back up give,...\u00a0...Next we need to set the two numerators equal....\u00a0...Now all that we need to do is correctly pick values of ... that will make one of the terms zero   and solve for the constants.\u00a0 Note that   in this case we will need to make one of them a fraction.\u00a0 This is fairly common so don\u2019t get excited   about it.\u00a0 Here is this work....\u00a0...\u00a0...The partial fraction decomposition for this expression is,...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...In this case the denominator has already been factored for   us.\u00a0 Notice as well that we\u2019ve now got   a linear factor to a power.\u00a0 So, recall   from our table that this means we will get 2 terms in the partial fraction   decomposition from this factor.\u00a0 Here   is the form of the partial fraction decomposition for this expression....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, remember that the LCD is just the denominator of the   original expression so in this case we\u2019ve got ....\u00a0 Adding the three terms back up gives us,...Remember that we just need to add in the factors that are missing   to each term....\u00a0...Now set the numerators equal....\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ve got a slightly different situation from   the previous two parts.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start by   picking a couple of values of ... and   seeing what we get since there are two that should jump right out at us as   being particularly useful....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we can get ...   and ... in the same manner that we\u2019ve   been using to this point.\u00a0 However,   there is no value of ... that will   allow us to eliminate the first and third term leaving only the middle term   that we can use to solve for ....\u00a0 While this may appear to be a problem it   actually isn\u2019t.\u00a0 At this point we know   two of the three constants.\u00a0 So all we   need to do is chose any other value of ...   that would be easy to work with (...   seems particularly useful here), plug that in along with the values of ... and ... and we\u2019ll get a simple equation that we can solve for .......\u00a0...Here is that work....\u00a0...In this case we got ...\u00a0this will happen on occasion, but do not   expect it to happen in all cases.\u00a0 Here   is the partial fraction decomposition for this part....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Again, the denominator has already been factored for   us.\u00a0 In this case the form of the   partial fraction decomposition is,...Adding the two terms together gives,...Notice that in this case the second term already had the   LCD under it and so we didn\u2019t need to add anything in that time....\u00a0...Setting the numerators equal gives,...\u00a0...Now, again, we can get ...   for free by picking .......\u00a0...To find ... we   will do the same thing that we did in the previous part.\u00a0 We\u2019ll use ...\u00a0and the fact that we know what ... is....\u00a0...In this case, notice that the constant in the numerator of   the first isn\u2019t zero as it was in the previous part.\u00a0\u00a0 Here is the partial fraction decomposition   for this part....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, we need to do a set of examples with quadratic factors.\u00a0 Note however, that this is where the work often gets fairly messy and in fact we haven\u2019t covered the material yet that will allow us to work many of these problems.\u00a0 We can work some simple examples however, so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Determine   the partial fraction decomposition of each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...   ...   ...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...In this case the ...   that sits in the front is a linear term since we can write it as,...and so the form of the partial fraction decomposition is,...\u00a0...Now we\u2019ll use the fact that the LCD is ...\u00a0and add the two terms together,...\u00a0...Next, set the numerators equal....\u00a0...This is where the process changes from the previous set of   examples.\u00a0 We could choose ...\u00a0to get the value of ..., but that\u2019s the only constant that we could get using this   method and so it just won\u2019t work all that well here....\u00a0...What we need to do here is multiply the right side out and   then collect all the like terms as follows,...\u00a0...Now, we need to choose ...,   ..., and ... so that these two are equal.\u00a0   That means that the coefficient of the ... term on the right side will have to be 8 since that   is the coefficient of the ...   term on the left side.\u00a0 Likewise, the   coefficient of the ... term on the   right side must be zero since there isn\u2019t an ... term on the left side.\u00a0   Finally the constant term on the right side must be -12 since that is   the constant on the left side....\u00a0...We generally call this ... and we\u2019ll write down the following   equations....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, we haven\u2019t talked about how to solve systems of   equations yet, but this is one that we can do without that knowledge.\u00a0 We can solve the third equation directly   for ... to get that ....\u00a0 We can then plug this into the first two   equations to get,...\u00a0...So, the partial fraction decomposition for this expression   is,... ...Here is the form of the partial fraction decomposition for   this part....\u00a0...Adding the two terms up gives,...\u00a0...Now, set the numerators equal and we might as well go   ahead and multiply the right side out and collect up like terms while we\u2019re   at it....\u00a0...Setting coefficients equal gives,...\u00a0...In this case we got ...   and ... for free and don\u2019t get   excited about the fact that ....\u00a0 This is not a problem and in fact when this   happens the remaining work is often a little easier.\u00a0 So, plugging the known values of ... and ... into the remaining two

They are,...Notice however, that the four fractions all reduce down to   two possible numbers.\u00a0 This will always   happen with these kinds of fractions.\u00a0   What we\u2019ll do from now on is form the fraction, do any simplification   of the numbers, ignoring the ...,   and then drop one of the .......\u00a0...So, the list possible rational zeroes for this polynomial   is,...\u00a0...So, it looks there are only 8 possible rational zeroes and   in this case they are all integers.\u00a0   Note as well that any rational zeroes of this polynomial WILL be   somewhere in this list, although we haven\u2019t found them yet....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll not put quite as much detail into this one.\u00a0 First get a list of all factors of -9 and   2.\u00a0 Note that the minus sign on the 9   isn\u2019t really all that important since we will still get a ...\u00a0on each of the factors....\u00a0...Now, the factors of -9 are all the possible numerators and   the factors of 2 are all the possible denominators....\u00a0...Here then is a list of all possible rational zeroes of   this polynomial....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got a total of 12 possible rational zeroes, half   are integers and half are fractions....\u00a0...The following fact will also be useful on occasion in finding the zeroes of a polynomial....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is a polynomial and we know that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0then somewhere between ... and ... is a zero of .......\u00a0...What this fact is telling us is that if we evaluate the polynomial at two points and one of the evaluations gives a positive value (... the point is above the ...-axis) and the other evaluation gives a negative value (... the point is below the ...-axis), then the only way to get from one point to the other is to go through the ...-axis.\u00a0 Or, in other words, the polynomial must have a zero, since we know that zeroes are where a graph touches or crosses the ...-axis....\u00a0...Note that this fact doesn\u2019t tell us what the zero is, it only tells us that one will exist.\u00a0 Also, note that if both evaluations are positive or both evaluations are negative there may or may not be a zero between them....\u00a0...Here is the process for determining all the rational zeroes of a polynomial....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...To simplify the second step we will use synthetic division.\u00a0 This will greatly simplify our life in several ways.\u00a0 First, recall that the last number in the final row is the polynomial evaluated at ... and if we do get a zero the remaining numbers in the final row are the coefficients for ...\u00a0and so we won\u2019t have to go back and find that....\u00a0...Also, in the evaluation step it is usually easiest to evaluate at the possible integer zeroes first and then go back and deal with any fractions if we have to....\u00a0...Let\u2019s see how this works....\u00a0...Determine   all the zeroes of .......\u00a0...We found the list of all possible rational zeroes in the   previous example.\u00a0 Here they are....\u00a0...\u00a0...We now need to start evaluating the polynomial at these   numbers.\u00a0 We can start anywhere in the   list and will continue until we find zero....\u00a0...To do the evaluations we will build a ....\u00a0   In a synthetic division table do the multiplications in our head and   drop the middle row just writing down the third row and since we will be   going through the process multiple times we put all the rows into a table....\u00a0...Here is the first synthetic division table for this   problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we found a zero. \u00a0Before getting into that let\u2019s recap the   computations here to make sure you can do them.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The top row is the coefficients from the polynomial and   the first column is the numbers that we\u2019re evaluating the polynomial at.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Each row (after the first) is the third row from the ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s quickly look at the first couple of   numbers in the second row.\u00a0 The number   in the second column is the first coefficient dropped down.\u00a0 The number in the third column is then   found by multiplying the -1 by 1 and adding to the -7.\u00a0 This gives the -8.\u00a0 For the fourth number is then -1 times -8   added onto 17.\u00a0 This is 25, ...\u00a0...You can do regular synthetic division if you need to, but   it\u2019s a good idea to be able to do these tables as it can help with the   process....\u00a0...Okay, back to the problem.\u00a0   We now know that ...\u00a0is a zero and so we can write the polynomial   as,...\u00a0...Now we need to repeat this process with the polynomial ....\u00a0 So, the first thing to do is to write down   all possible rational roots of this polynomial and in this case we\u2019re lucky   enough to have the first and last numbers in this polynomial be the same as   the original polynomial, that usually won\u2019t happen so don\u2019t always expect   it.\u00a0 Here is the list of all possible   rational zeroes of this polynomial....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, before doing a new synthetic division table let\u2019s   recall that we are looking for zeroes to ...\u00a0and from our first division table we   determined that ...\u00a0is NOT a zero of ...\u00a0and so there is no reason to bother with   that number again.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...This is something that we should always do at this step. \u00a0Take a look at the list of new possible   rational zeros and ask are there any that can\u2019t be rational zeroes of the   original polynomial.\u00a0 If there are   some, throw them out as we will already know that they won\u2019t work.\u00a0 So, a reduced list of numbers to try here   is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that we do need to include ...\u00a0in the list since it is possible for a zero   to occur more that once (...   multiplicity greater than one)....\u00a0...Here is the synthetic division table for this polynomial....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is also a zero of ...\u00a0and we can now write ...\u00a0as,...\u00a0...Now, technically we could continue the process with ...,   but this is a quadratic equation and we know how to find zeroes of these   without a complicated process like this so let\u2019s just solve this like we   normally would....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that these two numbers are in the list of possible   rational zeroes....\u00a0...Finishing up this problem then gives the following list of   zeroes for .......\u00a0...Note that ...\u00a0has a multiplicity of 2 since it showed up   twice in our work above....\u00a0...Before moving onto the next example let\u2019s also note that we can now completely factor the polynomial ....\u00a0 We know that each zero will give a factor in the factored form and that the exponent on the factor will be the multiplicity of that zero.\u00a0 So, the factored form is,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at another example....\u00a0...Find   all the zeroes of .......\u00a0...From the second example we know that the list of all   possible rational zeroes is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The next step is to build up the synthetic division table.   When we\u2019ve got fractions it\u2019s usually best to start with the integers and do   those first.\u00a0 Also, this time we\u2019ll   start with doing all the negative integers first.\u00a0 We are doing this to make a point on how we   can use the fact given above to help us identify zeroes....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, we haven\u2019t found a zero yet, however let\u2019s notice that   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and so by the fact above we know that there   must be a zero somewhere between ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Now, we can also notice that ...\u00a0is in this range and is the only number in   our list that is in this range and so there is a chance that this is a   zero.\u00a0 Let\u2019s run through synthetic   division real quick to check and see if it\u2019s a zero and to get the coefficients   for ...\u00a0if it is a zero....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we got a zero in the final spot which tells us that   this was a zero and ...\u00a0is,...\u00a0...We now need to repeat the whole process with this   polynomial.\u00a0 Also, unlike the previous   example we can\u2019t just reuse the original list since the last number is   different this time.\u00a0 So, here are the   factors of -6 and 2....\u00a0...\u00a0...Here is a list of all possible rational zeroes for .......\u00a0...Notice that some of the numbers appear in both rows and so   we can shorten the list by only writing them down once.\u00a0 Also, remember that we are looking for   zeroes of ...\u00a0and so we can exclude any number in this   list that isn\u2019t also in the original list we gave for ....\u00a0 So, excluding previously checked numbers   that were not zeros of ...\u00a0as well as those that aren\u2019t in the original   list gives the following list of possible number that we\u2019ll need to check....\u00a0...\u00a0...Again, we\u2019ve already checked ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and know that they aren\u2019t zeroes so there is   no reason to recheck them.\u00a0 Let\u2019s again   start with the integers and see what we get....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, ...\u00a0is a zero of ...\u00a0and we can now write ...\u00a0as,...and as with the previous example we can solve the   quadratic by other means....\u00a0...So, in this case we get a couple of complex zeroes.\u00a0 That can happen....\u00a0...Here is a complete list of all the zeroes for ...\u00a0and note that they all have multiplicity of   one....\u00a0...So, as you can see this is a fairly lengthy process and we only did the work for two 4... degree polynomials.\u00a0 The larger the degree the longer and more complicated the process.\u00a0 With that being said, however, it is sometimes a process that we\u2019ve got to go through to get zeroes of a polynomial.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/FindingZeroesOfPolynomials.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Finding Zeroes of Polynomials", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we are going to look at a method for getting a rough sketch of a general polynomial.\u00a0 The only real information that we\u2019re going to need is a complete list of all the zeroes (including multiplicity) for the polynomial.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this section we are going to either be given the list of zeroes or they will be easy to find.\u00a0 In the next section we will go into a method for determining a large portion of the list for most polynomials.\u00a0 We are graphing first since the method for finding all the zeroes of a polynomial can be a little long and we don\u2019t want to obscure the details of this section in the mess of finding the zeroes of the polynomial....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with the graph of couple of polynomials....Do not worry about the equations for these polynomials.\u00a0 We are giving these only so we can use them to illustrate some ideas about polynomials....\u00a0...First, notice that the graphs are nice and smooth.\u00a0 There are no holes or breaks in the graph and there are no sharp corners in the graph.\u00a0 The graphs of polynomials will always be nice smooth curves....\u00a0...Secondly, the \u201chumps\u201d where the graph changes direction from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing are often called ....\u00a0 If we know that the polynomial has degree ... then we will know that there will be at most ...\u00a0turning points in the graph.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...While this won\u2019t help much with the actual graphing process it will be a nice check.\u00a0 If we have a fourth degree polynomial with 5 turning point then we will know that we\u2019ve done something wrong since a fourth degree polynomial will have no more than 3 turning points....\u00a0...Next, we need to explore the relationship between the ...-intercepts of a graph of a polynomial and the zeroes of the polynomial.\u00a0 Recall that to find the ... of a function we need to solve the equation ...Also, recall that ...\u00a0is a zero of the polynomial, ..., provided ....\u00a0 But this means that ...\u00a0is also a solution to .......\u00a0...In other words, the zeroes of a polynomial are also the ...-intercepts of the graph.\u00a0 Also, recall that ...-intercepts can either cross the ...-axis or they can just touch the ...-axis without actually crossing the axis....\u00a0...Notice as well from the graphs above that the ...-intercepts can either flatten out as they cross the ...-axis or they can go through the ...-axis at an angle....\u00a0...The following fact will relate all of these ideas to the multiplicity of the zero....\u00a0...If ...\u00a0is a zero of the polynomial ...\u00a0with multiplicity ... then,...Furthermore, if ...\u00a0then the graph will flatten out at .......\u00a0...Finally, notice that as we let ... get large in both the positive or negative sense (... at either end of the graph) then the graph will either increase without bound or decrease without bound.\u00a0 This will always happen with every polynomial and we can use the following test to determine just what will happen at the endpoints of the graph....\u00a0...Suppose that ...\u00a0is a polynomial with degree ....\u00a0 So we know that the polynomial must look like, ...We don\u2019t know if there are any other terms in the polynomial, but we do know that the first term will have to be the one listed since it has degree ....\u00a0 We now have the following facts about the graph of ...\u00a0at the ends of the graph....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Okay, now that we\u2019ve got all that out of the way we can finally give a process for getting a rough sketch of the graph of a polynomial....\u00a0...\u00a0...We should give a quick warning about this process before we actually try to use it.\u00a0 This process assumes that all the zeroes are real numbers.\u00a0 If there are any complex zeroes then this process may miss some pretty important features of the graph....\u00a0...Let\u2019s sketch a couple of polynomials....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of .......\u00a0...We found the zeroes and multiplicities of this polynomial   in the previous ...   so we\u2019ll just write them back down here for reference purposes....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, from the fact we know that ...\u00a0will just touch the ...-axis and not actually cross it and that ...\u00a0will cross the ...-axis and will be flat as it does this since the multiplicity is   greater than 1....\u00a0...Next, the ...-intercept   is .......\u00a0...The coefficient of the 5... degree term is   positive and since the degree is odd we know that this polynomial will   increase without bound at the right end and decrease without bound at the   left end....\u00a0...Finally, we just need to evaluate the polynomial at a   couple of points.\u00a0 The points that we   pick aren\u2019t really all that important.\u00a0   We just want to pick points according to the guidelines in the process   outlined above and points that will be fairly easy to evaluate.\u00a0 Here are some points.\u00a0 We will leave it to you to verify the   evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, to actually sketch the graph we\u2019ll start on the left   end and work our way across to the right end.\u00a0   First, we know that on the left end the graph decreases without bound   as we make ... more and more negative...and this agrees with the point that   we evaluated at ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, as we move to the right the function will actually be   increasing at ...\u00a0and we will continue to increase until we   hit the first ...intercept at ... ....\u00a0 At this point we know that the graph just   touches the ...-axis without actually   crossing it.\u00a0 This means that at ...\u00a0the graph must be a turning point....\u00a0...The graph is now decreasing as we move to the right.\u00a0 Again, this agrees with the next point that   we\u2019ll run across, the ...-intercept....\u00a0...Now, according to the next point that we\u2019ve got, ...,   the graph must have another turning point somewhere between ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0since the graph is higher at ...\u00a0than at ....\u00a0 Just where this turning point will occur is   very difficult to determine at this level so we won\u2019t worry about trying to   find it.\u00a0 In fact, determining this   point usually requires some Calculus. ...\u00a0...So, we are moving to the right and the function is   increasing.\u00a0 The next point that we hit   is the ...-intercept at ...\u00a0and this one crosses the ...-axis so we know that there won\u2019t be   a turning point here as there was at the first ...-intercept.\u00a0 Therefore,   the graph will continue to increase through this point until we hit the final   point that we evaluated the function at, .......\u00a0...At this point we\u2019ve hit all the ...-intercepts and we know that the graph will increase without   bound at the right end and so it looks like all we need to do is sketch in an   increasing curve....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the polynomial....\u00a0...Note that one of the reasons for plotting points at the   ends is to see just how fast the graph is increasing or decreasing.\u00a0 We can see from the evaluations that the   graph is decreasing on the left end much faster than it\u2019s increasing on the   right end....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s take a look at another polynomial.\u00a0 This time we\u2019ll go all the way through the process of finding the zeroes....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of .......\u00a0...First, we\u2019ll need to factor this polynomial as much as   possible so we can identify the zeroes and get their multiplicities....Here is a list of the zeroes and their multiplicities....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the zeroes at ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0will correspond to ...-intercepts that cross the ...-axis   since their multiplicity is odd and will do so at an angle since their   multiplicity is NOT at least 2.\u00a0 The   zero at ...\u00a0will not cross the ...-axis since its multiplicity is even....\u00a0...The ...-intercept   is ...\u00a0and notice that this is also an ...-intercept....\u00a0...The coefficient of the 4... degree term is   positive and so since the degree is even we know that the polynomial will   increase without bound at both ends of the graph....\u00a0...Finally, here are some function evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, starting at the left end we know that as we make ... more and more negative the function   must increase without bound.\u00a0 That   means that as we move to the right the graph will actually be   decreasing.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...At ...\u00a0the graph will be decreasing and will   continue to decrease when we hit the first ...-intercept at ...\u00a0since we know that this ...-intercept will cross the ...-axis.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, since the next ...-intercept   is at ...\u00a0we will have to have a turning point   somewhere so that the graph can increase back up to this ...-intercept.\u00a0 Again, we   won\u2019t worry about where this turning point actually is....\u00a0...Once we hit the ...-intercept   at ...\u00a0we know that we\u2019ve got to have a turning   point since this ...-intercept   doesn\u2019t cross the ...-axis.\u00a0 Therefore to the right of ...\u00a0the graph will now be decreasing....\u00a0...It will continue to decrease until it hits another turning   point (at some unknown point) so that the graph can get back up to the ...-axis for the next ...-intercept at ....\u00a0 This is the final ...-intercept and since the graph is increasing at this point and   must increase without bound at this end we are done....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the graph....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of .......\u00a0...As with the previous example we\u2019ll first need to factor   this as much as possible....\u00a0...Notice that we first factored out a minus sign to make the   rest of the factoring a little easier.\u00a0   Here is a list of all the zeroes and their multiplicities....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, all three zeroes correspond to ...-intercepts that actually cross the ...-axis since all their multiplicities are odd, however, only the ...-intercept at ...\u00a0will cross the ...-axis flattened out....\u00a0...The ...-intercept   is ...\u00a0and as with the previous example this is   also an ...-intercept....\u00a0...In this case the coefficient of the 5... degree   term is negative and so since the degree is odd the graph will increase   without bound on the left side and decrease without bound on the right side....\u00a0...Here are some function evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...Alright, this graph will start out much as the previous   graph did.\u00a0 At the left end the graph   will be decreasing as we move to the right and will decrease through the   first ...-intercept at ...\u00a0since know that this ...-intercept crosses the ...-axis....\u00a0...Now at some point we\u2019ll get a turning point so the graph   can get back up to the next ...-intercept   at ...\u00a0and the graph will continue to increase   through this point since it also crosses the ...-axis.\u00a0 Note as well that   the graph should be flat at this point as well since the multiplicity is   greater than one....\u00a0...Finally, the graph will reach another turning point and   start decreasing so it can get back down to the final ...-intercept at ....\u00a0 Since we know that the graph will decrease   without bound at this end we are done....\u00a0...Here is the sketch of this polynomial....\u00a0...The process that we\u2019ve used in these examples can be a difficult process to learn.\u00a0 It takes time to learn how to correctly interpret the results....\u00a0...Also, as pointed out at various spots there are several situations that we won\u2019t be able to deal with here.\u00a0 To find the majority of the turning points we would need some Calculus, which we clearly don\u2019t have.\u00a0 Also, the process does require that we have all the zeroes and that they all be real numbers....\u00a0...Even with these drawbacks however, the process can at least give us an idea of what the graph of a polynomial will look like.", "url":

some different notation that you aren\u2019t used to and some of the properties may not be all that intuitive.\u00a0 Do not get discouraged however.\u00a0 Once you figure these out you will find that they really aren\u2019t that bad and it usually just takes a little working with them to get them figured out....\u00a0...Here is the definition of the logarithm function....If ... is any   number such that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0then,...We usually read this as \u201clog base ... of ...\u201d....\u00a0...In this definition ...\u00a0is called the ... and ...\u00a0is called the ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note that the requirement that ...\u00a0is really a result of the fact that we are also requiring ....\u00a0 If you think about it, it will make sense.\u00a0 We are raising a positive number to an exponent and so there is no way that the result can possibly be anything other than another positive number.\u00a0 It is very important to remember that we can\u2019t take the logarithm of zero or a negative number....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s address the notation used here as that is usually the biggest hurdle that students need to overcome before starting to understand logarithms.\u00a0 First, the \u201clog\u201d part of the function is simply three letters that are used to denote the fact that we are dealing with a logarithm.\u00a0 They are not variables and they aren\u2019t signifying multiplication.\u00a0 They are just there to tell us we are dealing with a logarithm....\u00a0...Next, the ... that is subscripted on the \u201clog\u201d part is there to tell us what the base is as this is an important piece of information.\u00a0 Also, despite what it might look like there is no exponentiation in the logarithm form above.\u00a0 It might look like we\u2019ve got ...\u00a0in that form, but it isn\u2019t.\u00a0 It just looks like that might be what\u2019s happening....\u00a0...It is important to keep the notation with logarithms straight, if you don\u2019t you will find it very difficult to understand them and to work with them....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a quick look at how we evaluate logarithms....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following logarithms....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Now, the reality is that evaluating logarithms directly   can be a very difficult process, even for those who really understand   them.\u00a0 It is usually much easier to   first convert the logarithm form into exponential form.\u00a0 In that form we can usually get the answer   pretty quickly....\u00a0... ...Okay what we are really asking here is the following....As suggested above, let\u2019s convert this to exponential   form....\u00a0...Most people cannot evaluate the logarithm ...\u00a0right off the top of their head.\u00a0 However, most people can determine the   exponent that we need on 4 to get 16 once we do the exponentiation.\u00a0 So, since,...we must have the following value of the logarithm....\u00a0... ...This one is similar to the previous part.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first convert to exponential form....\u00a0...If you don\u2019t know this answer right off the top of your   head, start trying numbers.\u00a0 In other   words, compute ...,   ...,   ...,   ... until you get 16.\u00a0 In this case we need an exponent of 4.\u00a0 Therefore, the value of this logarithm is,...\u00a0...Before moving on to the next part notice that the base on   these is a very important piece of notation.\u00a0   Changing the base will change the answer and so we always need to keep   track of the base.... ...We\u2019ll do this one without any real explanation to see how   well you\u2019ve got the evaluation of logarithms down.... ...Now, this one looks different from the previous parts, but   it really isn\u2019t any different.\u00a0 As   always let\u2019s first convert to exponential form....\u00a0...First, notice that the only way that we can raise an   integer to an integer power and get a fraction as an answer is for the   exponent to be negative.\u00a0 So, we know   that the exponent has to be negative....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s ignore the fraction for a second and ask ....\u00a0 In this case if we cube 5 we will get   125.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, it looks like we have the following,...\u00a0... ...Converting this logarithm to exponential form gives,...Now, just like the previous part, the only way that this   is going to work out is if the exponent is negative.\u00a0 Then all we need to do is recognize that ...\u00a0and we can see that,...\u00a0... ...Here is the answer to this one....\u00a0...Hopefully, you now have an idea on how to evaluate logarithms and are starting to get a grasp on the notation.\u00a0 There are a few more evaluations that we want to do however, we need to introduce some special logarithms that occur on a very regular basis.\u00a0 They are the ... and the ....\u00a0 Here are the definitions and notations that we will be using for these two logarithms....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the common logarithm is simply the log base 10, except we drop the \u201cbase 10\u201d part of the notation.\u00a0 Similarly, the natural logarithm is simply the log base ... with a different notation and where ... is the same number that we saw in the previous ... and is defined to be .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple more evaluations....\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following logarithms....To do the first four evaluations we just need to remember   what the notation for these are and what base is implied by the   notation.\u00a0 The final two evaluations   are to illustrate some of the properties of all logarithms that we\u2019ll be   looking at eventually....\u00a0... ...\u00a0because .......\u00a0... ...\u00a0because .......\u00a0... ...\u00a0because .......\u00a0... ...\u00a0because ....\u00a0 Notice that with this one we are really   just acknowledging a change of notation from fractional exponent into radical   form....\u00a0... ...\u00a0because ....\u00a0 Notice that this one will work regardless   of the base that we\u2019re using....\u00a0... ...\u00a0because ....\u00a0 Again, note that the base that we\u2019re using   here won\u2019t change the answer....\u00a0...So, when evaluating logarithms all that we\u2019re really asking is what exponent did we put onto the base to get the number in the logarithm....\u00a0...Now, before we get into some of the properties of logarithms let\u2019s first do a couple of quick graphs....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the common logarithm and the natural logarithm on the same axis   system....\u00a0...This example has two points.\u00a0 First, it will familiarize us with the   graphs of the two logarithms that we are most likely to see in other   classes.\u00a0 Also, it will give us some   practice using our calculator to evaluate these logarithms because the   reality is that is how we will need to do most of these evaluations....\u00a0...Here is a table of values for the two logarithms....\u00a0...-0.3010...-0.6931...1...0...0...2...0.3010...0.6931...3...0.4771...1.0986...4...0.6021...1.3863...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the graphs of these two functions....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s start looking at some properties of logarithms.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start off with some basic evaluation properties....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Properties 3 and 4 leads to a nice relationship between the logarithm and exponential function.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first compute the following ... for ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...\u00a0Recall from the section on ... that this means that the exponential and logarithm functions are inverses of each other.\u00a0 This is a nice fact to remember on occasion....\u00a0...We should also give the generalized version of\u00a0 Properties 3 and 4 in terms of both the natural and common logarithm as we\u2019ll be seeing those in the next couple of sections on occasion....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at some manipulation properties of the logarithm....\u00a0...For these properties we will assume that ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...We won\u2019t be doing anything with the final property in this section; it is here only for the sake of completeness.\u00a0 We will be looking at this property in detail in a couple of sections....\u00a0...The first two properties listed here can be a little confusing at first since on one side we\u2019ve got a product or a quotient inside the logarithm and on the other side we\u2019ve got a sum or difference of two logarithms.\u00a0 We will just need to be careful with these properties and make sure to use them correctly....\u00a0...Also, note that there are no rules on how to break up the logarithm of the sum or difference of two terms.\u00a0 To be clear about this let\u2019s note the following,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Be careful with these and do not try to use these as they simply aren\u2019t true....\u00a0...Note that all of the properties given to this point are valid for both the common and natural logarithms.\u00a0 We just didn\u2019t write them out explicitly using the notation for these two logarithms, the properties do hold for them nonetheless ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see some examples of how to use these properties....\u00a0...Simplify   each of the following logarithms....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The instructions here may be a little misleading.\u00a0 When we say simplify we really mean to say   that we want to use as many of the logarithm properties as we can....\u00a0... ...Note that we can\u2019t use Property 7 to bring the 3 and the 5   down into the front of the logarithm at this point.\u00a0 In order to use Property 7 the whole term   in the logarithm needs to be raised to the power.\u00a0 In this case the two exponents are only on   individual terms in the logarithm and so Property 7 can\u2019t be used here....\u00a0...We do, however, have a product inside the logarithm so we   can use Property 5 on this logarithm....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve done this we can use Property 7 on each of   these individual logarithms to get the final simplified answer....\u00a0... ...In this case we\u2019ve got a product and a quotient in the   logarithm.\u00a0 In these cases it is almost   always best to deal with the quotient before dealing with the product.\u00a0 Here is the first step in this part....\u00a0...Now, we\u2019ll break up the product in the first term and once   we\u2019ve done that we\u2019ll take care of the exponents on the terms....\u00a0... ...For this part let\u2019s first rewrite the logarithm a little   so that we can see the first step....Written in this form we can see that there is a single   exponent on the whole term and so we\u2019ll take care of that first....Now, we will take care of the product....Notice the parenthesis in this the answer.\u00a0 The ...\u00a0multiplies the original logarithm and so it   will also need to multiply the whole \u201csimplified\u201d logarithm.\u00a0 Therefore, we need to have a set of   parenthesis there to make sure that this is taken care of correctly....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll first take care of the quotient in this logarithm....We now reach the real point to this problem.\u00a0 The second logarithm is as simplified as we   can make it.\u00a0 Remember that we can\u2019t   break up a log of a sum or difference and so this can\u2019t be broken up any farther.\u00a0 Also, we can only deal with exponents if   the term as a whole is raised to the exponent.\u00a0 The fact that both pieces of this term are   squared doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 It needs to be   the whole term squared, as in the first logarithm....\u00a0...So, we can further simplify the first logarithm, but the   second logarithm can\u2019t be simplified any more.\u00a0 Here is the final answer for this problem....\u00a0...Now, we need to work some examples that go the other way.\u00a0 This next set of examples is probably more important than the previous set.\u00a0 We will be doing this kind of logarithm work in a couple of sections....\u00a0...Write   each of the following as a single logarithm with a coefficient of 1....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The instruction requiring a coefficient of 1 means that   the when we get down to a final logarithm there shouldn\u2019t be any number in   front of the logarithm....\u00a0...Note as well that these examples are going to be using   Properties 5 ...\u00a07 only we\u2019ll be using them in reverse.\u00a0 We will have expressions that look like the   right side of the property and use the property to write it so it looks like   the left side of the property....\u00a0... The first step here is to get rid of the coefficients on the   logarithms.\u00a0 This will use Property 7   in reverse.\u00a0 In this direction,   Property 7 says that we can move the coefficient of a logarithm up to become   a power on the term inside the logarithm....\u00a0...Here is that step for this part....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now got a sum of two logarithms both with   coefficients of 1 and both with the same base.\u00a0 This means that we can use Property 5 in   reverse.\u00a0 Here is the answer for this   part....\u00a0... Again, we will first take care of the coefficients on the   logarithms....\u00a0...We now have a difference of two logarithms and so we can   use Property 6 in reverse.\u00a0 When using   Property 6 in reverse remember that the term from the logarithm that is   subtracted off goes in the denominator of the quotient.\u00a0 Here is the answer to this part....\u00a0... In this case we\u2019ve got three terms to deal with and none of   the properties have three terms in them.\u00a0   That isn\u2019t a problem.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   first take care of the coefficients and at the same time we\u2019ll factor a minus   sign out of the last two terms.\u00a0 The   reason for this will be apparent in the next step....\u00a0...Now, notice that the quantity in the parenthesis is a sum   of two logarithms and so can be combined into a single logarithm with a   product as follows,...\u00a0...Now we are down to two logarithms and they are a   difference of logarithms and so we can write it as a single logarithm with a   quotient....\u00a0...The final topic that we need to discuss in this section is the ... formula....\u00a0...Most calculators these days are capable of evaluating common logarithms and natural logarithms.\u00a0 However, that is about it, so what do we do if we need to evaluate another logarithm that can\u2019t be done easily as we did in the first set of examples that we looked at?...\u00a0...To do this we have the change of base formula.\u00a0 Here is the change of base formula....where we can choose ... to be anything we want it to be.\u00a0 In order to use this to help us evaluate logarithms this is usually the common or natural logarithm.\u00a0 Here is the change of base formula using both the common logarithm and the natural logarithm....Let\u2019s see how this works with an example....\u00a0...Evaluate   .......First, notice that we can\u2019t use the same method to do this   evaluation that we did in the first set of examples.\u00a0 This would require us to look at the   following exponential form,...and that\u2019s just not something that anyone can answer off   the top of their head.\u00a0 If the 7 had   been a 5, or a 25, or a 125, ....   we could do this, but it\u2019s not.\u00a0   Therefore, we have to use the change of base formula....\u00a0...Now, we can use either one and we\u2019ll get the same   answer.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s use both and verify   that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with the common   logarithm form of the change of base....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s try the natural logarithm form of the change of   base formula....\u00a0...So, we got the same answer despite the fact that the   fractions involved different answers.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/LogFunctions.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Logarithm Functions", "subject": "math"}},

(the first equation, although it isn\u2019t in standard form) and a ... (the second equation if we   solved for ...).\u00a0 As with the first example we can\u2019t use   elimination on this system so we will have to use substitution....\u00a0...The best way is to solve the second equation for either ... or ....\u00a0 Either one will give us   pretty much the same work so we\u2019ll solve for ... since that is probably the one that will make the equation look more   like those that we\u2019ve looked at in the past.\u00a0   In other words, the new equation will be in terms of ... and that is the variable that we are   used to seeing in equations....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...The first step towards solving this equation will be to   multiply the whole thing by ...   to clear out the denominators....\u00a0...Now, this is ... and we know how to solve those kinds of equations.\u00a0 If we define,...and the equation can be written as,...\u00a0...In terms of ...   this means that we have the following,...\u00a0...So, we have four possible values of ... and two of them are complex.\u00a0   To determine the values of ...   we can plug these into our substitution....\u00a0...\u00a0...For the complex solutions, notice that we made sure the ... was in the numerator.\u00a0 The for solutions are then,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Two of the solutions are real and so represent   intersection points of the graphs of these two equations.\u00a0 The other two are complex solutions and   while solutions will not represent intersection points of the curves....\u00a0...For reference purposes, here is a sketch of the two   curves....\u00a0...Note that there are only two intersection points of these   two graphs as suggested by the two real solutions.\u00a0 Complex solutions never represent intersections   of two curves....\u00a0...Solve   the following system of equations....This time we have an ...   and a hyperbola.\u00a0 Neither one are in   standard form however....\u00a0...In the first two examples we\u2019ve used the substitution   method to solve the system and we can use that here as well.\u00a0 Let\u2019s notice however, that if we just add   the two equations we will eliminate the ...\u2019s   from the system so we\u2019ll do it that way....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is easy enough to solve for .......\u00a0...To determine the value(s) of the ...\u2019s we can substitute these into either of the equations.\u00a0 We will use the first since there won\u2019t be   any minus signs to worry about....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that for this system, unlike the previous examples,   each value of ... actually gave two   possible values of ....\u00a0 That means that there are in fact four   solutions.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This also means that there should be four intersection   points to the two curves.\u00a0 Here is a   sketch for verification.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/NonlinearSystems.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Nonlinear Systems", "subject": "math"}},

(which is 4 in this case) and put this number in the second   row.\u00a0 Finally, add the numbers in the   first and second row putting the results in the third row.\u00a0 We continue this until we get reach the   final number in the first row....\u00a0...Now, notice that the numbers in the bottom row are the   coefficients of the quadratic polynomial from our answer written in order of   decreasing exponent and the final number in the third row is the remainder....\u00a0...The answer is then the same as the first example....\u00a0...\u00a0...We\u2019ll do some more examples of synthetic division in a bit.\u00a0 However, we really should generalize things out a little first with the following fact....\u00a0...\u00a0...Given a polynomial ...   with degree at least 1 and any number ...   there is another polynomial ...,   called the ..., with degree   one less than the degree of ...   and a number ..., called the ..., such that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note as well that ... and ... are unique, or in other words, there is only one ... and ... that will work for a given ... and .......\u00a0...So, with the one example we\u2019ve done to this point we can see that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s work a couple more synthetic division problems....\u00a0...Use   synthetic division to do each of the following divisions....Divide   ...\u00a0by ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Divide   ...\u00a0by\u00a0 ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...Okay in this case we need to be a little careful   here.\u00a0 We MUST divide by a term in the   form ...\u00a0in order for this to work and that minus   sign is absolutely required.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re   first going to need to write ...\u00a0as,...and in doing so we can see that .......\u00a0...We can now do synthetic division and this time we\u2019ll just   put up the results and leave it to you to check all the actual numbers....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, in this case we have,...\u00a0... ...In this case we\u2019ve got ...=6.\u00a0 Here is the work....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case we then have....\u00a0...So, just why are we doing this?\u00a0 That\u2019s a natural question at this point.\u00a0 One answer is that, down the road in a later section, we are going to want to get our hands on the ....\u00a0 Just why we might want to do that will have to wait for an explanation until we get to that point....\u00a0...There is also another reason for this that we are going to make heavy usage of later on.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first start out with the division algorithm....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s evaluate the polynomial ... at ....\u00a0 If we had an actual polynomial here we could evaluate ... directly of course, but let\u2019s use the division algorithm and see what we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, that\u2019s convenient.\u00a0 The remainder of the division algorithm is also the value of the polynomial evaluated at ....\u00a0 So, from our previous examples we now know the following function evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is a very quick method for evaluating polynomials.\u00a0 For polynomials with only a few terms and/or polynomials with \u201csmall\u201d degree this may not be much quicker that evaluating them directly.\u00a0 However, if there are many terms in the polynomial and they have large degrees this can be much quicker and much less prone to mistakes than computing them directly....\u00a0...As noted, we will be using this fact in a later section to greatly reduce the amount of work we\u2019ll need to do in those problems.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/DividingPolynomials.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Dividing Polynomials", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this final section we need to discuss graphing rational functions.\u00a0 It\u2019s is probably best to start off with a fairly simple one that we can do without all that much knowledge on how these work....\u00a0...Let\u2019s sketch the graph of ....\u00a0 First, since this is a rational function we are going to have to be careful with division by zero issues.\u00a0 So, we can see from this equation that we\u2019ll have to avoid ...\u00a0since that will give division by zero....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s just plug in some values of ... and see what we get....\u00a0...-4...-0.25...-2...-0.5...-1...-1...-0.1...-10...-0.01...-100...0.01...100...0.1...10...1...1...2...0.5...4...0.25...So, as ... get large (positively and negatively) the function keeps the sign of ... and gets smaller and smaller.\u00a0 Likewise as we approach ...\u00a0the function again keeps the same sign as ... but starts getting quite large.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of this graph....\u00a0...\u00a0...First, notice that the graph is in two pieces.\u00a0 Almost all rational functions will have graphs in multiple pieces like this.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Next, notice that this graph does not have any intercepts of any kind.\u00a0 That\u2019s easy enough to check for ourselves.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Recall that a graph will have a ...-intercept at the point ....\u00a0 However, in this case we have to avoid ...\u00a0and so this graph will never cross the ...-axis.\u00a0 It does get very close to the ...-axis, but it will never cross or touch it and so no ...-intercept....\u00a0...Next, recall that we can determine where a graph will have ...-intercepts by solving ....\u00a0 For rational functions this may seem like a mess to deal with.\u00a0 However, there is a nice fact about rational functions that we can use here.\u00a0 A rational function will be zero at a particular value of ... only if the numerator is zero at that ... and the denominator isn\u2019t zero at that ....\u00a0 In other words, to determine if a rational function is ever zero all that we need to do is set the numerator equal to zero and solve.\u00a0 Once we have these solutions we just need to check that none of them make the denominator zero as well....\u00a0...In our case the numerator is one and will never be zero and so this function will have no ...-intercepts.\u00a0 Again, the graph will get very close to the ...-axis but it will never touch or cross it....\u00a0...Finally, we need to address the fact that graph gets very close to the ... and ...-axis but never crosses.\u00a0 Since there isn\u2019t anything special about the axis themselves we\u2019ll use the fact that the ...-axis is really the line given by ...\u00a0and the ...-axis is really the line given by .......\u00a0...In our graph as the value of ... approaches ...\u00a0the graph starts gets very large on both sides of the line given by ....\u00a0 This line is called a ...\u00a0...Also, as ... get very large, both positive and negative, the graph approaches the line given by ....\u00a0\u00a0 This line is called a ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here are the general definitions of the two asymptotes....\u00a0...\u00a0...Determining asymptotes is actually a fairly simple process.\u00a0 First, let\u2019s start with the rational function,...where ... is the largest exponent in the numerator and ... is the largest exponent in the denominator....\u00a0...We then have the following facts about asymptotes....\u00a0...\u00a0...The process for graphing a rational function is fairly simple.\u00a0 Here it is....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that the sketch that we\u2019ll get from the process is going to be a fairly rough sketch but that is okay.\u00a0 That\u2019s all that we\u2019re really after is a basic idea of what the graph will look at....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following function....So, we\u2019ll start off with the intercepts.\u00a0 The ...-intercept   is,...The ...-intercepts   will be,...\u00a0...Now, we need to determine the asymptotes.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first find the vertical asymptotes....So, we\u2019ve got one vertical asymptote.\u00a0 This means that there are now two regions   of ...\u2019s.\u00a0 They are ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Now, the largest exponent in the numerator and denominator   is 1 and so by the fact there will be a horizontal asymptote at the line....\u00a0...Now, we just need points in each region of ...\u2019s.\u00a0   Since the ...-intercept and ...-intercept are already in the left   region we won\u2019t need to get any points there.\u00a0   That means that we\u2019ll just need to get a point in the right   region.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t really matter what   value of ... we pick here we just   need to keep it fairly small so it will fit onto our graph....\u00a0...\u00a0...Okay, putting all this together gives the following graph....Note that the asymptotes are shown as dotted lines....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following function....Okay, we\u2019ll start with the intercepts.\u00a0 The ...-intercept   is,...The numerator is a constant and so there won\u2019t be any ...-intercepts since the function can   never be zero....\u00a0...Next, we\u2019ll have vertical asymptotes at,...So, in this case we\u2019ll have three regions to our graph : ...,   ...,   .......\u00a0...Also, the largest exponent in the denominator is 2 and   since there are no ...\u2019s in the   numerator the largest exponent is 0, so by the fact the ...-axis will be the horizontal asymptote....\u00a0...Finally, we need some points.\u00a0 We\u2019ll use the following points here....Notice that along with the ...-intercept we actually have three points in the middle   region.\u00a0 This is because there are a   couple of possible behaviors in this region and we\u2019ll need to determine the   actual behavior.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see the other   main behaviors in the next examples and so this will make more sense at that   point....\u00a0...Here is the sketch of the graph....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of the following function....This time notice that if we were to plug in ...into the denominator we would get   division by zero.\u00a0 This means there   will not be a ...-intercept for this   graph.\u00a0 We have however, managed to   find a vertical asymptote already....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see if we\u2019ve got ...-intercepts....So, we\u2019ve got two of them....\u00a0...We\u2019ve got one vertical asymptote, but there may be more so   let\u2019s go through the process and see....So, we\u2019ve got two again and the three regions that we\u2019ve   got are ...,   ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Next, the largest exponent in both the numerator and   denominator is 2 so by the fact there will be a horizontal asymptote at the   line,...\u00a0...Now, one of the ...-intercepts   is in the far left region so we don\u2019t need any points there.\u00a0 The other ...-intercept is in the middle region.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll need a point in the far right   region and as noted in the previous example we will want to get a couple more   points in the middle region to completely determine its behavior....\u00a0...Here is the sketch for this function....\u00a0...Notice that this time the middle region doesn\u2019t have the   same behavior at the asymptotes as we saw in the previous example.\u00a0 This can and will happen fairly often.\u00a0 Sometimes the behavior at the two   asymptotes will be the same as in the previous example and sometimes it will   have the opposite behavior at each asymptote as we see in this example.\u00a0 Because of this we will always need to get   a couple of points in these types of regions to determine just what the   behavior will be.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/GraphRationalFcns.aspx", "media": "text", "title":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we want to look at the graph of a quadratic function.\u00a0 The most general form of a quadratic function is,...\u00a0...The graphs of quadratic functions are called ....\u00a0 Here are some examples of parabolas....\u00a0...All parabolas are vaguely \u201cU\u201d shaped and they will have a highest or lowest point that is called the ....\u00a0 Parabolas may open up or down and may or may not have ...-intercepts and they will always have a single ...-intercept.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note as well that a parabola that opens down will always open down and a parabola that opens up will always open up.\u00a0 In other words a parabola will not all of a sudden turn around and start opening up if it has already started opening down.\u00a0 Similarly, if it has already started opening up it will not turn around and start opening down all of a sudden. ...\u00a0...The dashed line with each of these parabolas is called the ....\u00a0 Every parabola has an axis of symmetry and, as the graph shows, the graph to either side of the axis of symmetry is a mirror image of the other side.\u00a0 This means that if we know a point on one side of the parabola we will also know a point on the other side based on the axis of symmetry.\u00a0 We will see how to find this point once we get into some examples....\u00a0...We should probably do a quick review of ... before going much farther.\u00a0 Intercepts are the points where the graph will cross the ... or ...-axis.\u00a0 We also saw a graph in the section where we introduced intercepts where an intercept just touched the axis without actually crossing it....\u00a0...Finding intercepts is a fairly simple process.\u00a0 To find the ...-intercept of a function ...\u00a0all we need to do is set ...\u00a0and evaluate to find the ... coordinate.\u00a0 In other words, the ...-intercept is the point ....\u00a0 We find ...-intercepts in pretty much the same way.\u00a0 We set ...\u00a0and solve the resulting equation for the ... coordinates.\u00a0 So, we will need to solve the equation,...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s get back to parabolas.\u00a0 There is a basic process we can always use to get a pretty good sketch of a parabola.\u00a0 Here it is....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, there are two forms of the parabola that we will be looking at.\u00a0 This first form will make graphing parabolas very easy.\u00a0 Unfortunately, most parabolas are not in this form.\u00a0 The second form is the more common form and will require slightly (and only slightly) more work to sketch the graph of the parabola....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at the first form of the parabola....\u00a0...\u00a0...There are two pieces of information about the parabola that we can instantly get from this function.\u00a0 First, if ... is positive then the parabola will open up and if ... is negative then the parabola will open down.\u00a0 Secondly, the vertex of the parabola is the point ....\u00a0 Be very careful with signs when getting the vertex here....\u00a0...So, when we are lucky enough to have this form of the parabola we are given the vertex for free. ...\u00a0...Let\u2019s see a couple of examples here....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of each of the following parabolas....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Okay, in all of these we will simply go through the   process given above to find the needed points and the graph....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...First we need to find the vertex.\u00a0 We will need to be careful with the signs   however.\u00a0 Comparing our equation to the   form above we see that we must have ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0since that is the only way to get the   correct signs in our function.\u00a0   Therefore, the vertex of this parabola is,...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s find the ...-intercept.\u00a0 This is nothing more than a quick function   evaluation....\u00a0...Next we need to find the ...-intercepts.\u00a0 This means   we\u2019ll need to solve an equation.\u00a0   However, before we do that we can actually tell whether or not we\u2019ll   have any before we even start to solve the equation.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In this case we have ...\u00a0which is positive and so we know that the   parabola opens up.\u00a0 Also the vertex is   a point below the ...-axis.\u00a0 So, we know that the parabola will have at   least a few points below the ...-axis   and it will open up.\u00a0 Therefore, since   once a parabola starts to open up it will continue to open up eventually we   will have to cross the ...-axis.\u00a0 In other words, there are ...-intercepts for this parabola....\u00a0...To find them we need to solve the following equation....We solve equations like this back when we were solving ... so hopefully you   remember how to do them....\u00a0...The two ...-intercepts   are then,...\u00a0...Now, at this point we\u2019ve got points on either side of the   vertex so we are officially done with finding the points.\u00a0 However, let\u2019s talk a little bit about how   to find a second point using the ...-intercept   and the axis of symmetry since we will need to do that eventually....\u00a0...First, notice that the ...-intercept   has an ... coordinate of 0 while the   vertex has an ... coordinate of   -3.\u00a0 This means that the ...-intercept is a distance of 3 to the   right of the axis of symmetry since that will move straight up from the   vertex.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, the left part of the graph will be a mirror image of   the right part of the graph.\u00a0 So, since   there is a point at ...\u00a0that is a distance of 3 to the right of the   axis of symmetry there must also be a point at ...\u00a0that is a distance of 3 to the left of the   axis of symmetry.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, since the ...   coordinate of the vertex is -3 and this new point is a distance of 3 to the   left its ... coordinate must be   -6.\u00a0 The coordinates of this new point   are then ....\u00a0 We can verify this by evaluating the   function at ....\u00a0 If we are correct we should get a value of   10.\u00a0 Let\u2019s verify this....\u00a0...So, we were correct.\u00a0   Note that we usually don\u2019t bother with the verification of this point....\u00a0...Okay, it\u2019s time to sketch the graph of the parabola.\u00a0 Here it is....\u00a0...Note that we included the axis of symmetry in this graph   and typically we won\u2019t.\u00a0 It was just   included here since we were discussing it earlier....\u00a0... ...Okay with this one we won\u2019t put in quite a much   detail.\u00a0 First let\u2019s notice that ...\u00a0which is negative and so we know that this   parabola will open downward....\u00a0...Next, by comparing our function to the general form we see   that the vertex of this parabola is ....\u00a0 Again, be careful to get the signs correct   here!...\u00a0...Now let\u2019s get the ...-intercept....The ...-intercept   is then .......\u00a0...Now, we know that the vertex starts out below the ...-axis and the parabola opens   down.\u00a0 This means that there can\u2019t   possibly be ...-intercepts since the ... axis is above the vertex and the   parabola will always open down.\u00a0 This   means that there is no reason, in general, to go through the solving process   to find what won\u2019t exist....\u00a0...However, let\u2019s do it anyway.\u00a0 This will show us what to look for if we   don\u2019t catch right away that they won\u2019t exist from the vertex and direction   the parabola opens.\u00a0 We\u2019ll need to   solve,...So, we got complex solutions.\u00a0 Complex solutions will always indicate no ...-intercepts....\u00a0...Now, we do want points on either side of the vertex so   we\u2019ll use the ...-intercept and the   axis of symmetry to get a second point.\u00a0   The ...-intercept is a   distance of two to the left of the axis of symmetry and is at ...\u00a0and so there must be a second point at the   same ... value only a distance of 2   to the right of the axis of symmetry.\u00a0   The coordinates of this point must then be .......\u00a0...Here is the sketch of this parabola....\u00a0... ...This one is actually a fairly simple one to graph.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first notice that it will open   upwards....\u00a0...Now, the vertex is probably the point where most students   run into trouble here.\u00a0 Since we have ... by itself this means   that we must have ...\u00a0and so the vertex is .......\u00a0...Note that this means there will not be any ...-intercepts with this parabola since   the vertex is above the ...-axis and   the parabola opens upwards....\u00a0...Next, the ...-intercept   is,...\u00a0...The ...-intercept   is exactly the same as the vertex.\u00a0   This will happen on occasion so we shouldn\u2019t get too worried about it   when that happens.\u00a0 Although this will   mean that we aren\u2019t going to be able to use the ...-intercept to find a second point on the other side of the   vertex this time.\u00a0 In fact, we don\u2019t   even have a point yet that isn\u2019t the vertex!...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ll need to find a point on either side of the   vertex.\u00a0 In this case since the   function isn\u2019t too bad we\u2019ll just plug in a couple of points....Note that we could have gotten the second point here using   the axis of symmetry if we\u2019d wanted to....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the graph....\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve seen some examples now of this form of the parabola.\u00a0 However, as noted earlier most parabolas are not given in that form.\u00a0 So, we need to take a look at how to graph a parabola that is in the general form....\u00a0...In this form the sign of ... will determine whether or not the parabola will open upwards or downwards just as it did in the previous set of examples.\u00a0 Unlike the previous form we will not get the vertex for free this time.\u00a0 However, it is will easy to find.\u00a0 Here is the vertex for a parabola in the general form....To get the vertex all we do is compute the ... coordinate from ... and ... and then plug this into the function to get the ... coordinate.\u00a0 Not quite as simple as the previous form, but still not all that difficult....\u00a0...Note as well that we will get the ...-intercept for free from this form.\u00a0 The ...-intercept is,...so we won\u2019t need to do any computations for this one....\u00a0...Let\u2019s graph some parabolas....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of each of the following parabolas....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... For this parabola we\u2019ve got ...,   ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Make sure that you\u2019re careful with signs   when identifying these values.\u00a0 So we   know that this parabola will open up since ... is positive.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here are the evaluations for the vertex....The vertex is then ....\u00a0 Now at this point we also know that there   won\u2019t be any ...-intercepts for this   parabola since the vertex is above the ...-axis   and it opens upward....\u00a0...The ...-intercept   is ...\u00a0and using the axis of symmetry we know that ...\u00a0must also be on the parabola....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the parabola....\u00a0... In this case ...,   ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 From these we see that the parabola will   open downward since ... is   negative.\u00a0 Here are the vertex   evaluations....So, the vertex is ...\u00a0and we also can see that this time there   will be ...-intercepts.\u00a0 In fact, let\u2019s go ahead and find them now....So, the ...-intercepts   are ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Notice that ...\u00a0is also the ...-intercept.\u00a0 This will   happen on occasion so don\u2019t get excited about it when it does....\u00a0...At this point we\u2019ve got all the information that we need   in order to sketch the graph so here it is,...\u00a0...\u00a0 In this final part we   have ...,   ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 So, this parabola will open up....\u00a0...Here are the vertex evaluations....So, the vertex is ....\u00a0 Note that since the ... coordinate of this point is zero it is also an ...-intercept.\u00a0 In fact it will be the only ...-intercept for this graph.\u00a0 This makes sense if we consider the fact   that the vertex, in this case, is the lowest point on the graph and so the   graph simply can\u2019t touch the ...-axis   anywhere else....\u00a0...The fact that this parabola has only one ...-intercept can be verified by solving   as we\u2019ve done in the other examples to this point....\u00a0...Sure enough there is only one ...-intercept.\u00a0 Note that   this will mean that we\u2019re going to have to use the axis of symmetry to get a   second point from the ...-intercept   in this case....\u00a0...Speaking of which, the ...-intercept   in this case is ....\u00a0 This means that the second point is .......\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the graph....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0As a final topic in this section we need to briefly talk about how to take a parabola in the general form and convert it into the form...\u00a0...This will use a modified ... process.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably best to do this with an example....\u00a0...Convert   each of the following into the form .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Okay, as we pointed out above we are going to complete the   square here.\u00a0 However, it is a slightly   different process than the other times that we\u2019ve seen it to this point....\u00a0... The thing that we\u2019ve got to remember here is that we must   have a coefficient of 1 for the ...   term in order to complete the square.\u00a0   So, to get that we will first factor the coefficient of the ... term out of the whole   right side as follows....\u00a0...Note that this will often put fractions into the problem   that is just something that we\u2019ll need to be able to deal with.\u00a0 Also note that if we\u2019re lucky enough to   have a coefficient of 1 on the ...   term we won\u2019t have to do this step....\u00a0...Now, this is where the process really starts differing   from what we\u2019ve seen to this point.\u00a0 We   still take one-half the coefficient of ...   and square it.\u00a0 However, instead of   adding this to both sides we do the following with it....\u00a0...We add and subtract this quantity inside the parenthesis   as shown.\u00a0 Note that all we are really   doing here is adding in zero since 9-9=0!\u00a0   The order listed here is important.\u00a0   We MUST add first and then subtract....\u00a0...The next step is to factor the first three terms and   combine the last two as follows....\u00a0...As a final step we multiply the 2 back through....\u00a0...And there we go....\u00a0... Be careful here.\u00a0 We   don\u2019t have a coefficient of 1 on the ...   term, we\u2019ve got a coefficient of -1.\u00a0   So, the process is identical outside of that so we won\u2019t put in as   much detail this time.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Parabolas.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Parabolas", "subject": "math"}},

section this means that these are very special functions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see just what makes them so special.\u00a0 Consider the following evaluations....\u00a0...\u00a0...In the first case we plugged ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and got a value of -5.\u00a0 We then turned around and plugged ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and got a value of -1, the number that we started off with.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the second case we did something similar.\u00a0 Here we plugged ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and got a value of ..., we turned around and plugged this into ...\u00a0and got a value of 2, which is again the number that we started with....\u00a0...Note that we really are doing some function composition here.\u00a0 The first case is really,...and the second case is really,...\u00a0...Note as well that these both agree with the formula for the compositions that we found in the previous section.\u00a0 We get back out of the function evaluation the number that we originally plugged into the composition....\u00a0...So, just what is going on here?\u00a0 In some way we can think of these two functions as undoing what the other did to a number.\u00a0 In the first case we plugged ...\u00a0into ...\u00a0and then plugged the result from this function evaluation back into ...\u00a0and in some way ...\u00a0undid what ...\u00a0had done to ...\u00a0and gave us back the original ... that we started with....\u00a0...Function pairs that exhibit this behavior are called ....\u00a0 Before formally defining inverse functions and the notation that we\u2019re going to use for them we need to get a definition out of the way. \u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...A function is called ... if no two values of ... produce the same ....\u00a0 This is a fairly simple definition of one-to-one but it takes an example of a function that isn\u2019t one-to-one to show just what it means. \u00a0Before doing that however we should note that this definition of one-to-one is not really the mathematically correct definition of one-to-one.\u00a0 It is identical to the mathematically correct definition it just doesn\u2019t use all the notation from the formal definition....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see an example of a function that isn\u2019t one-to-one.\u00a0 The function ...\u00a0is not one-to-one because both ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 In other words there are two different values of ... that produce the same value of ....\u00a0 Note that we can turn ...\u00a0into a one-to-one function if we restrict ourselves to ....\u00a0 This can sometimes be done with functions....\u00a0...Showing that a function is one-to-one is often a tedious and often difficult.\u00a0 For the most part we are going to assume that the functions that we\u2019re going to be dealing with in this section are one-to-one.\u00a0 We did need to talk about one-to-one functions however since only one-to-one functions can be inverse functions....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s formally define just what inverse functions are.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Given two one-to-one functions ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0if...then we say that ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are ...   of each other.\u00a0 More specifically we   will say that ...\u00a0is the ...   of ...\u00a0and denote it by...Likewise we could also say that ...\u00a0is the ...   of ...\u00a0and denote it by...The notation that we use really depends upon the problem.\u00a0 In most cases either is acceptable....\u00a0...For the two functions that we started off this section with we could write either of the following two sets of notation....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, be careful with the notation for inverses.\u00a0 The \u201c-1\u201d is NOT an exponent despite the fact that is sure does look like one!\u00a0 When dealing with inverse functions we\u2019ve got to remember that ...This is one of the more common mistakes that students make when first studying inverse functions....\u00a0...The process for finding the inverse of a function is a fairly simple one although there is a couple of steps that can on occasion be somewhat messy.\u00a0 Here is the process...\u00a0...Given the function ...\u00a0we want to find the inverse function, .......\u00a0...That\u2019s the process.\u00a0 Most of the steps are not all that bad but as mentioned in the process there are a couple of steps that we really need to be careful with....\u00a0...In the verification step we technically really do need to check that both ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0are true.\u00a0 For all the functions that we are going to be looking at in this section if one is true then the other will also be true.\u00a0 However, there are functions (they are far beyond the scope of this course however) for which it is possible for only of these to be true.\u00a0 This is brought up because in all the problems here we will be just checking one of them.\u00a0 We just need to always remember that technically we should check both....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some examples....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0find .......\u00a0...Now, we already know what the inverse to this function is   as we\u2019ve already done some work with it.\u00a0   However, it would be nice to actually start with this since we know   what we should get.\u00a0 This will work as   a nice verification of the process....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started.\u00a0   We\u2019ll first replace ...\u00a0with .......\u00a0...Next, replace all ...\u2019s   with ... and all ... with .......\u00a0...Now, solve for .......\u00a0...Finally replace ...   with .......\u00a0...Now, we need to verify the results.\u00a0 We already took care of this in the   previous section, however, we really should follow the process so we\u2019ll do   that here.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter which of   the two that we check we just need to check one of them.\u00a0 This time we\u2019ll check that ...\u00a0is true....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0find ...,   ... .......\u00a0...Now the fact that we\u2019re now using ...\u00a0instead of ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t change how the process works.\u00a0 Here are the first few steps....\u00a0...Now, to solve for ...   we will need to first square both sides and then proceed as normal....\u00a0...This inverse is then,...\u00a0...Finally let\u2019s verify and this time we\u2019ll use the other one   just so we can say that we\u2019ve gotten both down somewhere in an example....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we did the work correctly and we do indeed have the   inverse....\u00a0...Before we move on we should also acknowledge the   restrictions of ... ...\u00a0that we gave in the problem statement but   never apparently did anything with.\u00a0   Note that this restriction is required to make sure that the inverse, ...\u00a0given above is in fact one-to-one.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Without this restriction the inverse would not be   one-to-one as is easily seen by a couple of quick evaluations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Therefore, the   restriction is required in order to make sure the inverse is one-to-one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The next example can be a little messy so be careful with the work here....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0find .......The first couple of steps are pretty much the same as the   previous examples so here they are,...\u00a0...Now, be careful with the solution step.\u00a0 With this kind of problem it is very easy   to make a mistake here....\u00a0...So, if we\u2019ve done all of our work correctly the inverse   should be,...\u00a0...Finally we\u2019ll need to do the verification.\u00a0 This is also a fairly messy process and it   doesn\u2019t really matter which one we work with....\u00a0...Okay, this is a mess.\u00a0   Let\u2019s simplify things up a little bit by multiplying the numerator and   denominator by .......\u00a0...Wow.\u00a0 That was a lot   of work, but it all worked out in the end.\u00a0   We did all of our work correctly and we do in fact have the inverse....\u00a0...There is one final topic that we need to address quickly before we leave this section.\u00a0 There is an interesting relationship between the graph of a function and its inverse....\u00a0...Here is the graph of the function and inverse from the first two examples.\u00a0 We\u2019ll not deal with the final example since that is a function that we haven\u2019t really talked about graphing yet....In both cases we can see that the graph of the inverse is a reflection of the actual function about the line ....\u00a0 This will always be the case with the graphs of a

you\u2019ll recall seeing at some point in the past....\u00a0...Given two points ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0the distance between them is given by,...\u00a0...So, why did we remind you of this formula?\u00a0 Well, let\u2019s recall just what a circle is.\u00a0 A circle is all the points that are the same distance, ... ...\u00a0called the radius, from a point, ...\u00a0- called the center.\u00a0 In other words, if ...\u00a0is any point that is on the circle then it has a distance of ... from the center, .......\u00a0...If we use the distance formula on these two points we would get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Or, if we square both sides we get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is the ... of the equation of a circle with radius ... and center .......\u00a0...Write   down the equation of a circle with radius 8 and center .......\u00a0...Okay, in this case we have ...,   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0so all we need to do is plug them into the   standard form of the equation of the circle....\u00a0...\u00a0...Do not square out the two terms on the left.\u00a0 Leaving these terms as they are will allow us to quickly identify the equation as that of a circle and to quickly identify the radius and center of the circle....\u00a0...Graphing circles is a fairly simple process once we know the radius and center.\u00a0 In order to graph a circle all we really need is the right most, left most, top most and bottom most points on the circle.\u00a0 Once we know these it\u2019s easy to sketch in the circle. ...\u00a0...Nicely enough for us these points are easy to find.\u00a0 Since these are points on the circle we know that they must be a distance of ... from the center.\u00a0 Therefore the points will have the following coordinates....\u00a0...\u00a0...In other words all we need to do is add ... on to the ... coordinate or ... coordinate of the point to get the right most or top most point respectively and subtract ... from the ... coordinate or ... coordinate to get the left most or bottom most points....\u00a0...Let\u2019s graph some circles....\u00a0...Determine   the center and radius of each of the following circles and sketch the graph   of the circle....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...In all of these all that we really need to do is compare   the equation to the standard form and identify the radius and center.\u00a0 Once that is done find the four points   talked about above and sketch in the circle....\u00a0... ...In this case it\u2019s just ...   and ... squared by themselves.\u00a0 The only way that we could have this is to   have both ... and ... be zero.\u00a0 So, the center and radius is,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget that the radius is the square root of the   number on the other side of the equal sign.\u00a0   Here is a sketch of this circle....\u00a0...A circle centered at the origin with radius 1 (... this circle) is called the ....\u00a0 The unit circle is very useful in a   Trigonometry class....\u00a0... ...In this part, it looks like the ... coordinate of the center is zero as with the previous   part.\u00a0 However, this time there is   something more with the ... term and   so comparing this term to the standard form of the circle we can see that the   ... coordinate of the center must be   3.\u00a0 The center and radius of this   circle is then,...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the circle.\u00a0 The center is marked with a red cross in   this graph....\u00a0... ...For this part neither of the coordinates of the center are   zero.\u00a0 By comparing our equation with   the standard form it\u2019s fairly easy to see (hopefully\u2026) that the ... coordinate of the center is 1.\u00a0 The ...   coordinate isn\u2019t too bad either, but we do need to be a little careful.\u00a0 In this case the term is ...\u00a0and in the standard form the term is ....\u00a0 Note that the signs are different.\u00a0 The only way that this can happen is if ... is negative.\u00a0 So, the ...   coordinate of the center must be -4....\u00a0...The center and radius for this circle are,...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of this circle with the center marked   with a red cross....\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve seen how to deal with circles that are already in the standard form.\u00a0 However, not all circles will start out in the standard form.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s take a look at how to put a circle in the standard form....\u00a0...Determine   the center and radius of each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Neither of these equations are in standard form and so to   determine the center and radius we\u2019ll need to put it into standard form.\u00a0 We actually already know how to do   this.\u00a0 Back when we were solving   quadratic equations we saw a way to turn a quadratic polynomial into a   perfect square.\u00a0 The process was called   .......\u00a0...This is exactly what we want to do here, although in this   case we aren\u2019t solving anything and we\u2019re going to have to deal with the fact   that we\u2019ve got both\u00a0 ... and ... in the equation.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   step through the process with the first part....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll go through the process in a step by step fashion   with this one....\u00a0...First   get the constant on one side by itself and at the same time group the ... terms together and the ... terms together....\u00a0...In this case there was only one term with a ... in it and two with ...\u2019s in them....\u00a0...For   each variable with two terms complete the square on those terms....\u00a0...So, in this case that means that we only need to complete   the square on the ... terms.\u00a0 Recall how this is done.\u00a0 We first take half the coefficient of the ... and square it....We then add this to both sides of the equation....\u00a0...Now, the first three terms will factor as a perfect   square....\u00a0...\u00a0 This is now the standard form of the   equation of a circle and so we can pick the center and radius right off   this.\u00a0 They are,...\u00a0... ...In this part we\u2019ll go through the process a little   quicker.\u00a0 First get terms properly   grouped and placed....\u00a0...Now, as noted above we\u2019ll need to complete the square   twice here, once for the ... terms   and once for the ... terms.\u00a0 Let\u2019s first get the numbers that we\u2019ll need   to add to both sides....\u00a0...Now, add these to both sides of the equation.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...When adding the numbers to both sides make sure and place   them properly.\u00a0 This means that we need   to put the number from the coefficient of the ... with the ... terms and   the number from the coefficient of the ...   with the ... terms.\u00a0 This

These are the same functions that we used in the first set of   examples and we\u2019ve already done this part there so we won\u2019t redo all the work   here.\u00a0 It is here only here to prove   the point that function composition is NOT function multiplication.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is the multiplication of these two functions....\u00a0... Now, for function composition all you need to remember is   that we are going to plug the second function listed into the first function   listed.\u00a0 If you can remember that you   should always be able to write down the basic formula for the composition....\u00a0...Here is this function composition....\u00a0...Now, notice that since we\u2019ve got a formula for ...\u00a0we went ahead and plugged that in   first.\u00a0 Also, we did this kind of   function evaluation in the first ... we   looked at for functions.\u00a0 At the time   it probably didn\u2019t seem all that useful to be looking at that kind of   function evaluation, yet here it is....\u00a0...Let\u2019s finish this problem out....\u00a0...Notice that this is very different from the   multiplication!\u00a0 Remember that function   composition is NOT function multiplication....\u00a0... We\u2019ll not put in the detail in this part as it works   essentially the same as the previous part....\u00a0...Notice that this is NOT the same answer as that from the   second part.\u00a0 In most cases the order   in which we do the function composition will give different answers....\u00a0...The ideas from the previous example are important enough to make again.\u00a0 First, function composition is NOT function multiplication.\u00a0 Second, the order in which we do function composition is important.\u00a0 In most case we will get different answers with a different order.\u00a0 Note however, that there are times when we will get the same answer regardless of the order....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple more examples....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0evaluate each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Not much to do here other than run through the formula....\u00a0... ...Again, not much to do here.... ...Now in this case do not get excited about the fact that   the two functions here are the same.\u00a0   Composition works the same way....\u00a0... ...In this case, unlike all the previous examples, we\u2019ve got   a number in the parenthesis instead of an ...,   but it works in exactly the same manner....\u00a0... ...Again, we\u2019ve got a number here.\u00a0 This time there are actually two ways to do   this evaluation.\u00a0 The first is to   simply use the results from the first part since that is a formula for the   general function composition. ...\u00a0...If we do the problem that way we get,...\u00a0...We could also do the evaluation directly as we did in the   previous part.\u00a0 The answers should be   the same regardless of how we get them.\u00a0   So, to get another example down of this kind of evaluation let\u2019s also   do the evaluation directly....\u00a0...So, sure enough we got the same answer, although it did   take more work to get it....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0evaluate each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...   ...   ... Hopefully, by this point these aren\u2019t too bad....Looks like things simplified down considerable here....\u00a0...\u00a0... All we need to do here is use the formula so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...So, in this case we get the same answer regardless of the   order we did the composition in....\u00a0...So, as we\u2019ve seen from this last example it is possible to get the same answer from both compositions on occasion.\u00a0 In fact when the answer from both composition is ..., as it is in this case, we know that these two functions are very special functions.\u00a0 In fact, they are so special that we\u2019re going to devote the whole next section to these kinds of functions.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s move onto the next section....\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/CombineFunctions.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Combining Functions", "subject": "math"}},

so we aren\u2019t going to go into great depth here.\u00a0 We will only be reviewing some of the basic ideas....\u00a0...We will start off with the Rectangular or Cartesian coordinate system.\u00a0 This is just the standard axis system that we use when sketching our graphs.\u00a0 Here is the Cartesian coordinate system with a few points plotted....\u00a0...\u00a0...The horizontal and vertical axes, typically called the...and the ... respectively, divide the coordinate system up into quadrants as shown above.\u00a0 In each quadrant we have the following signs for ... and .......\u00a0...Quadrant I...,   or ... positive...,   or ... positive...Quadrant II...,   or ... negative...,   or ... positive...Quadrant III...,   or ... negative...,   or ... negative...Quadrant IV...,   or ... positive...,   or ... negative...\u00a0...Each point in the coordinate system is defined by an ... of the form ....\u00a0 The first number listed is the ... of the point and the second number listed is the ... of the point.\u00a0 The ordered pair for any given point, ..., is called the ... for the point.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The point where the two axes cross is called the ... and has the coordinates ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Note as well that the order of the coordinates is important.\u00a0 For example, the point ...\u00a0is the point that is two units to the right of the origin and then 1 unit up, while the point ...\u00a0is the point that is 1 unit to the right of the origin and then 2 units up....\u00a0...We now need to discuss graphing an equation.\u00a0 The first question that we should ask is what exactly is a graph of an equation?\u00a0 A graph is the set of all the ordered pairs whose coordinates satisfy the equation....\u00a0...For instance, the point ...\u00a0is a point on the graph of ...\u00a0while ...\u00a0isn\u2019t on the graph.\u00a0 How do we tell this?\u00a0 All we need to do is take the coordinates of the point and plug them into the equation to see if they satisfy the equation.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do that for both to verify the claims made above....\u00a0...:...In this case we have ...\u00a0and ... ...\u00a0so plugging in gives,...\u00a0...So, the coordinates of this point satisfies the equation and so it is a point on the graph....\u00a0...:...Here we have ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Plugging these in gives,...\u00a0...The coordinates of this point do NOT satisfy the equation and so this point isn\u2019t on the graph....\u00a0...Now, how do we sketch the graph of an equation?\u00a0 Of course, the answer to this depends on just how much you know about the equation to start off with.\u00a0 For instance, if you know that the equation is a line or a circle we\u2019ve got simple ways to determine the graph in these cases.\u00a0 There are also many other kinds of equations that we can usually get the graph from the equation without a lot of work.\u00a0 We will see many of these in the next chapter....\u00a0...However, let\u2019s suppose that we don\u2019t know ahead of time just what the equation is or any of the ways to quickly sketch the graph.\u00a0 In these cases we will need to recall that the graph is simply all the points that satisfy the equation.\u00a0 So, all we can do is plot points.\u00a0 We will pick values of ..., compute ... from the equation and then plot the ordered pair given by these two values.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...How, do we determine which values of ... to choose?\u00a0 Unfortunately, the answer there is we guess.\u00a0 We pick some values and see what we get for a graph.\u00a0 If it looks like we\u2019ve got a pretty good sketch we stop.\u00a0 If not we pick some more.\u00a0 Knowing the values of ... to choose is really something that we can only get with experience and some knowledge of what the graph of the equation will ... look like.\u00a0 Hopefully, by the end of this course you will have gained some of this knowledge....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at a graph....\u00a0...Sketch   the graph of .......\u00a0...Now, this is a parabola and after the next chapter you   will be able to quickly graph this without much effort.\u00a0 However, we haven\u2019t gotten that far yet and   so we will need to choose some values of ...,   plug them in and compute the ...   values....\u00a0...As mentioned earlier, it helps to have an idea of what   this graph is liable to look like when picking values of ....\u00a0 So, don\u2019t worry at this   point why we chose the values that we did.\u00a0   After the next chapter you would also be able to choose these values   of .......\u00a0...Here is a table of values for this equation....\u00a0...-2...5...-1...0...0...-3...1...-4...2...-3...3...0...4...5...\u00a0...Let\u2019s verify the first one and we\u2019ll leave the rest to you   to verify.\u00a0 For the first one we simply   plug ...\u00a0into the equation and compute .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Here is the graph of this equation....\u00a0...Notice that when we set up the axis system in this example, we only set up as much as we needed.\u00a0 For example, since we didn\u2019t go past -2 with our computations we didn\u2019t go much past that with our axis system.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, notice that we used a different scale on each of the axes.\u00a0 With the horizontal axis we incremented by 1\u2019s while on the vertical axis we incremented by 2.\u00a0 This will often be done in order to make the sketching easier....\u00a0...The final topic that we want to discuss in this section is that of ....\u00a0 Notice that the graph in the above example crosses the ...-axis in two places and the ...-axis in one place.\u00a0 All three of these points are called intercepts.\u00a0 We can, and often will be, more specific however....\u00a0...We often will want to know if an intercept crosses the ... or ...-axis specifically.\u00a0 So, if an intercept crosses the ...-axis we will call it an ....\u00a0 Likewise, if an intercept crosses the ...-axis we will call it a ....\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, since the ...-intercept crosses ...-axis then the ... coordinates of the ...-intercept(s) will be zero.\u00a0 Also, the ... coordinate of the ...-intercept will be zero since these points cross the ...-axis.\u00a0 These facts give us a way to determine the intercepts for an equation.\u00a0 To find the ...-intercepts for an equation all that we need to do is set ...\u00a0and solve for ....\u00a0 Likewise to find the ...-intercepts for an equation we simply need to set ...\u00a0and solve for .......\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a quick look at an example....\u00a0...Determine   the ...-intercepts and ...-intercepts for each of the following   equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...As verification for each of these we will also sketch the   graph of each function.\u00a0 We will leave   the details of the sketching to you to verify.\u00a0 Also, these are all parabolas and as mentioned   earlier we will be looking at these in detail in the next chapter....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s first find the ...-intercept(s).\u00a0 Again, we do this by setting ...\u00a0and solving for ....\u00a0 This is usually the   easier of the two.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s find the ...-intercept(s)....So, there is a single ...-intercept   : .......\u00a0...The work for the ...-intercept(s)   is almost identical except in this case we set ...\u00a0and solve for ....\u00a0 Here is that work....\u00a0...\u00a0...For this equation there are two ...-intercepts : ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Oh, and you do remember how to solve ... right?...\u00a0...For verification purposes here is sketch of the graph for   this equation....\u00a0... ...First, the ...-intercepts....So, we\u2019ve got a single ...-intercepts.\u00a0 Now, the ...-intercept(s)....Okay, we got complex solutions from this equation.\u00a0 What this means is that we will not have   any ...-intercepts.\u00a0 Note that it is perfectly acceptable for   this to happen so don\u2019t worry about it when it does happen....\u00a0...Here is the graph for this equation....\u00a0...Sure enough, it doesn\u2019t cross the ...-axis....\u00a0... ...Here is the ...-intercept   work for this equation....Now the ...-intercept   work....In this case we have a single ...-intercept....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the graph for this equation....\u00a0...Now, notice that in this case the graph doesn\u2019t actually   cross the ...-axis at ....\u00a0 This point is still called an ...-intercept however....\u00a0...We should make one final comment before leaving this section.\u00a0 In the previous set of examples all the equations were quadratic equations.\u00a0 This was done only because the exhibited the range of behaviors that we were looking for and we would be able to do the work as well.\u00a0 You should not walk away from this discussion of intercepts with the idea that they will only occur for quadratic

(or denominator of the slope) and then up/down by ... (or the numerator of the slope) depending on the sign of the ....\u00a0 We can also write down some equations for the coordinates of the second point as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that if the slope is negative then the ... will be a negative number....\u00a0...Let\u2019s compute a couple of slopes....\u00a0...Determine   the slope of each of the following lines.\u00a0   Sketch the graph of each line....The   line that contains the two points ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...The   line that contains the two points ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...The   line that contains the two points ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...The   line that contains the two points ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Okay, for each of these all that we\u2019ll need to do is use   the slope formula to find the slope and then plot the two points and connect   them with a line to get the graph....\u00a0... ...Do not worry which point gets the subscript of 1 and which   gets the subscript of 2.\u00a0 Either way   will get the same answer.\u00a0 Typically,   we\u2019ll just take them in the order listed.\u00a0   So, here is the slope for this part....Be careful with minus signs in these computations.\u00a0 It is easy to lose track of them.\u00a0 Also, when the slope is a fraction, as it   is here, leave it as a fraction.\u00a0 Do   not convert to a decimal unless you absolutely have to....\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the line....Notice that this line increases as we move from left to   right.... ...Here is the slope for this part....Again, watch out for minus signs.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of the graph....This line decreases as we move from left to right....\u00a0... ...Here is the slope for this line....We got a slope of zero here.\u00a0 That is okay, it will happen   sometimes.\u00a0 Here is the sketch of the   line....In this case we\u2019ve got a horizontal line....\u00a0... ...The final part.\u00a0   Here is the slope computation....In this case we get division by zero which is   undefined.\u00a0 Again, don\u2019t worry too much   about this it will happen on occasion.\u00a0   Here is a sketch of this line....This final line is a vertical line....\u00a0...We can use this set of examples to see some general facts about lines....\u00a0...First, we can see from the first two parts that the larger the number (ignoring any minus signs) the steeper the line.\u00a0 So, we can use the slope to tell us something about just how steep a line is....\u00a0...Next, we can see that if the slope is a positive number then the line will be increasing as we move from left to right.\u00a0 Likewise, if the slope is a negative number then the line will decrease as we move from left to right....\u00a0...We can use the final two parts to see what the slopes of horizontal and vertical lines will be.\u00a0 A horizontal line will always have a slope of zero and a vertical line will always have an undefined slope....\u00a0...We now need to take a look at some special forms of the equation of the line....\u00a0...We will start off with horizontal and vertical lines.\u00a0 A horizontal line with a ...-intercept of ... will have the equation,...\u00a0...Likewise, a vertical line with an ...-intercept of ... will have the equation,...\u00a0...So, if we go back and look that the last two parts of the previous example we can see that the equation of the line for the horizontal line in the third part is ...while the equation for the vertical line in the fourth part is...\u00a0...The next special form of the line that we need to look at is the ... of the line.\u00a0 This form is very useful for writing down the equation of a line.\u00a0 If we know that a line passes through the point ...\u00a0and has a slope of ... then the point-slope form of the equation of the line is,...\u00a0...Sometimes this is written as,...\u00a0...The form it\u2019s written in usually depends on the instructor that is teaching the class....\u00a0...As stated earlier this form is particularly useful for writing down the equation of a line so let\u2019s take a look at an example of this....\u00a0...Write   down the equation of the line that passes through the two points ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...At first glance it may not appear that we\u2019ll be able to   use the point-slope form of the line since this requires a single point   (we\u2019ve got two) and the slope (which we don\u2019t have).\u00a0 However, that fact that we\u2019ve got two   points isn\u2019t really a problem; in fact, we can use these two points to   determine the missing slope of the line since we do know that we can always   find that from any two points on the line....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s start off my finding the slope of the line....\u00a0...Now, which point should we use to write down the equation   of the line?\u00a0 We can actually use   either point.\u00a0 To show this we will use   both....\u00a0...First, we\u2019ll use ....\u00a0 Now that we\u2019ve gotten the point all that we   need to do is plug into the formula.\u00a0   We will use the second form....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s use .......\u00a0...Okay, we claimed that it wouldn\u2019t matter which point we   used in the formula, but these sure look like different equations.\u00a0 It turns out however, that these really are   the same equation.\u00a0 To see this all   that we need to do is distribute the slope through the parenthesis and then   simplify....\u00a0...Here is the first equation....Here is the second equation....So, sure enough they are the same equation....\u00a0...The final special form of the equation of the line is probably the one that most people are familiar with.\u00a0 It is the ....\u00a0 In this case if we know that a line has slope ... and has a ...-intercept of ...\u00a0then the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line is,...\u00a0...This form is particularly useful for graphing lines.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...\u00a0...Determine   the slope of each of the following equations and sketch the graph of the   line....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...Okay, to get the slope we\u2019ll first put each of these in   slope-intercept form and then the slope will simply be the coefficient of the   ... (including sign).\u00a0 To graph the line we know the ...-intercept of the line, that\u2019s the   number without an ... (including   sign) and as discussed above we can use the slope to find a second point on   the line.\u00a0 At that point there isn\u2019t   anything to do other than sketch the line....\u00a0... ...First solve the equation for ....\u00a0 Remember that we solved   equations like this ... in the previous   chapter....\u00a0...So, the slope for this line is 3 and the ...-intercept is the point ....\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to take the sign when determining   the ...-intercept.\u00a0 Now, to find the second point we usually   like the slope written as a fraction to make it clear what the ... and ... are.\u00a0 So,...\u00a0...The second point is then,...\u00a0...Here is a sketch of the graph of the line....\u00a0... ...Again, solve for .......In this case the slope is ...\u00a0and the ...-intercept   is ....\u00a0 As with the previous part let\u2019s first   determine the ... and the .......Again, remember that if the slope is negative make sure   that the minus sign goes with the numerator.\u00a0   The second point is then,...\u00a0...Here is the sketch of the graph for this line....\u00a0...The final topic that we need to discuss in this section is that of parallel and perpendicular lines.\u00a0 Here is a sketch of parallel and perpendicular lines....Suppose that the slope of Line 1 is ...\u00a0and the slope of Line 2 is ....\u00a0 We can relate the slopes of parallel lines and we can relate slopes of perpendicular lines as follows....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that there are two forms of the equation for perpendicular lines.\u00a0 The second is the more common and in this case we usually say that ...\u00a0is the negative reciprocal of .......\u00a0...Determine   if the line that passes through the points ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0is parallel, perpendicular or neither to the   line given by .......\u00a0...Okay, in order to do answer this we\u2019ll need the slopes of   the two lines.\u00a0 Since we have two   points for the first line we can use the formula for the slope,...We don\u2019t actually need the equation of this line and so we   won\u2019t bother with it....\u00a0...Now, to get the slope of the second line all we need to do   is put it into slope-intercept form....\u00a0...Okay, since the two slopes aren\u2019t the same (they\u2019re close,   but still not the same) the two lines are not parallel.\u00a0 Also,...so the two lines aren\u2019t perpendicular either....\u00a0...Therefore, the two lines are neither parallel nor   perpendicular....\u00a0...Determine   the equation of the line that passes through the point ...\u00a0and is,...parallel   to the line given by ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...perpendicular   to the line given by ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...In both parts we are going to need the slope of the line   given by ...\u00a0so let\u2019s actually find that before we get   into the individual parts....Now, let\u2019s work the example....\u00a0... ...In this case the new line is to be parallel to the line   given by ...\u00a0and so it must have the same slope as this   line.\u00a0 Therefore we know that,...\u00a0...Now, we\u2019ve got a point on the new line, ...,   and we know the slope of the new line, ...,   so we can use the point-slope form of the line to write down the equation of   the new line.\u00a0 Here is the equation,...\u00a0... ...For this part we want the line to be perpendicular to ...\u00a0and so we know we can find the new slope as   follows,...Then, just as we did in the previous part we can use the   point-slope form of the line to get the equation of the new line.\u00a0 Here it is,", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Lines.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Lines", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We now need to move into the second topic of this chapter.\u00a0 Before we do that however we need a quick definition taken care of....\u00a0...A ... is a   set of ordered pairs....\u00a0...This seems like an odd definition but we\u2019ll need it for the definition of a function (which is the main topic of this section).\u00a0 However, before we actually give the definition of a function let\u2019s see if we can get a handle on just what a relation is....\u00a0...Think back to ... in the Graphing section of this chapter.\u00a0 In that example we constructed a set of ordered pairs we used to sketch the graph of ....\u00a0 Here are the ordered pairs that we used....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Any of the following are then relations because they consist of a set of ordered pairs....\u00a0...\u00a0...There are of course many more relations that we could form from the list of ordered pairs above, but we just wanted to list a few possible relations to give some examples.\u00a0 Note as well that we could also get other ordered pairs from the equation and add those into any of the relations above if we wanted to....\u00a0...Now, at this point you are probably asking just why we care about relations and that is a good question.\u00a0 Some relations are very special and are used at almost all levels of mathematics.\u00a0 The following definition tells us just which relations are these special relations....\u00a0...A ... is a   relation for which each value from the set the first components of the   ordered pairs is associated with exactly one value from the set of second   components of the ordered pair....\u00a0...Okay, that is a mouth full.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see if we can figure out just what it means.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at the following example that will hopefully help us figure all this out....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...The   following relation is a function....\u00a0...\u00a0...From these ordered pairs we have the following sets of   first components (... the first   number from each ordered pair) and second components (... the second number from each ordered pair)....\u00a0...\u00a0...For the set of second components notice that the \u201c-3\u201d   occurred in two ordered pairs but we only listed it once. ...\u00a0...To see why this relation is a function simply pick any   value from the set of first components.\u00a0   Now, go back up to the relation and find every ordered pair in which   this number is the first component and list all the second components from   those ordered pairs.\u00a0 The list of   second components will consist of exactly one value.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...For example let\u2019s choose 2 from the set of first   components.\u00a0 From the relation we see   that there is exactly one ordered pair with 2 as a first component, ....\u00a0 Therefore the list of second components (... the list of values from the set   of second components) associated with 2 is exactly one number, -3....\u00a0...Note that we don\u2019t care that -3 is the second component of   a second ordered par in the relation.\u00a0   That is perfectly acceptable.\u00a0   We just don\u2019t want there to be any more than one ordered pair with 2   as a first component....\u00a0...We looked at a single value from the set of first   components for our quick example here but the result will be the same for all   the other choices.\u00a0 Regardless of the   choice of first components there will be exactly one second component   associated with it....\u00a0...Therefore this relation is a function....\u00a0...In order to really get a feel for what the definition of a function is telling us we should probably also check out an example of a relation that is not a function....\u00a0...The   following relation is not a function....\u00a0...\u00a0...Don\u2019t worry about where this relation came from.\u00a0 It is just one that we made up for this example....\u00a0...Here is the list of first and second components...\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...From the set of first components let\u2019s choose 6.\u00a0 Now, if we go up to the relation we see   that there are two ordered pairs with 6 as a first component : ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 The list of second components associated   with 6 is then : 10, -4.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The list of second components associated with 6 has two   values and so this relation is not a function....\u00a0...Note that the fact that if we\u2019d chosen -7 or 0 from the   set of first components there is only one number in the list of second   components associated with each.\u00a0 This   doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 The fact that we found   even a single value in the set of first components with more than one second   component associated with it is enough to say that this relation is not a   function....\u00a0...As a final comment about this example let\u2019s note that if   we removed the first and/or the fourth ordered pair from the relation we   would have a function!...\u00a0...So, hopefully you have at least a feeling for what the definition of a function is telling us.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve forced you to go through the actual definition of a function let\u2019s give another \u201cworking\u201d definition of a function that will be much more useful to what we are doing here....\u00a0...The actual definition works on a relation.\u00a0 However, as we saw with the four relations we gave prior to the definition of a function and the relation we used in Example 1 we often get the relations from some equation.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...It is important to note that not all relations come from equations!\u00a0 The relation from the second example for instance was just a set of ordered pairs we wrote down for the example and didn\u2019t come from any equation.\u00a0 This can also be true with relations that are functions.\u00a0 They do not have to come from equations....\u00a0...However, having said that, the functions that we are going to be using in this course do all come from equations.\u00a0 Therefore, let\u2019s write down a definition of a function that acknowledges this fact....\u00a0...Before we give the \u201cworking\u201d definition of a function we need to point out that this is NOT the actual definition of a function, that is given above.\u00a0 This is simply a good \u201cworking definition\u201d of a function that ties things to the kinds of functions that we will be working with in this course....\u00a0...A ... is   an equation for which any ... that   can be plugged into the equation will yield exactly one ... out of the equation....\u00a0...There it is.\u00a0 That is the definition of functions that we\u2019re going to use and will probably be easier to decipher just what it means.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Before we examine this a little more note that we used the phrase \u201c... that can be plugged into\u201d in the definition.\u00a0 This tends to imply that not all ...\u2019s can be plugged into an equation and this is in fact correct.\u00a0 We will come back and discuss this in more detail towards the end of this section, however at this point just remember that we can\u2019t divide by zero and if we want real numbers out of the equation we can\u2019t take the square root of a negative number.\u00a0 So, with these two examples it is clear that we will not always be able to plug in every ... into any equation....\u00a0...Further, when dealing with functions we are always going to assume that both ... and ... will be real numbers.\u00a0 In other words, we are going to forget that we know anything about complex numbers for a little bit while we deal with this section....\u00a0...Okay, with that out of the way let\u2019s get back to the definition of a function and let\u2019s look at some examples of equations that are functions and equations that aren\u2019t functions....\u00a0...Determine   which of the following equations are functions and which are not functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The \u201cworking\u201d definition of function is saying is that if   we take all possible values of ...   and plug them into the equation and solve for ... we will get exactly one value for each value of ....\u00a0   At this stage of the game it can be pretty difficult to actually show   that an equation is a function so we\u2019ll mostly talk our way through it.\u00a0 On the other hand it\u2019s often quite easy to   show that an equation isn\u2019t a function....\u00a0...\u00a0...   ...So, we need to show that no matter what ... we plug into the equation and solve   for ... we will only get a single   value of ....\u00a0 Note as well that the value of ... will probably be different for each   value of ..., although it doesn\u2019t   have to be....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start this off by plugging in some values of ... and see what happens....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, for each of these value of ... we got a single value of ...   out of the equation.\u00a0 Now, this isn\u2019t   sufficient to claim that this is a function.\u00a0   In order to officially prove that this is a function we need to show   that this will work no matter which value of ... we plug into the equation....\u00a0...Of course we can\u2019t plug all possible value of ... into the equation.\u00a0 That just isn\u2019t physically possible.\u00a0 However, let\u2019s go back and look at the ones   that we did plug in.\u00a0 For each ..., upon plugging in, we first   multiplied the ... by 5 and then   added 1 onto it.\u00a0 Now, if we multiply a   number by 5 we will get a single value from the multiplication.\u00a0 Likewise, we will only get a single value   if we add 1 onto a number.\u00a0 Therefore,   it seems plausible that based on the operations involved with plugging ... into the equation that we will only   get a single value of ... out of the   equation....\u00a0...So, this equation is a function....\u00a0... ...Again, let\u2019s plug in a couple of values of ... and solve for ... to see what happens....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s think a little bit about what we were doing   with the evaluations.\u00a0 First we squared   the value of ... that we plugged   in.\u00a0 When we square a number there will   only be one possible value.\u00a0 We then   add 1 onto this, but again, this will yield a single value....\u00a0...So, it seems like this equation is also a function....\u00a0...Note that it is okay to get the same ... value for different ...\u2019s.\u00a0 For example,...We just can\u2019t get more than one ... out of the equation after we plug in the .......\u00a0... ...As we\u2019ve done with the previous two equations let\u2019s plug   in a couple of value of ..., solve   for ... and see what we get....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, remember that we\u2019re solving for ... and so that means that in the first and last case above we will   actually get two different ... values   out of the ... and so this equation   is NOT a function....\u00a0...Note that we can have values of ... that will yield a single ...   as we\u2019ve seen above, but that doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0   If even one value of ...   yields more than one value of ...   upon solving the equation will not be a function....\u00a0...What this really means is that we didn\u2019t need to go any   farther than the first evaluation, since that gave multiple values of .......\u00a0... ...With this case we\u2019ll use the lesson learned in the   previous part and see if we can find a value of ... that will give more than one value of ... upon solving.\u00a0 Because   we\u2019ve got a ... in the   problem this shouldn\u2019t be too hard to do since solving will eventually mean   using the ... which   will give more than one value of .......\u00a0...\u00a0...So, this equation is not a function.\u00a0 Recall, that from the previous section this   is the equation of a circle.\u00a0 Circles   are never functions....\u00a0...Hopefully these examples have given you a better feel for what a function actually is....\u00a0...We now need to move onto something called ....\u00a0 Function notation will be used heavily throughout most of the remaining chapters in this course and so it is important to understand it....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off with the following quadratic equation....\u00a0...We can use a process similar to what we used in the previous set of examples to convince ourselves that this is a function.\u00a0 Since this is a function we will denote it as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we replaced the ... with the notation ....\u00a0 This is read as \u201cf of ...\u201d.\u00a0 Note that there is nothing special about the ... we used here.\u00a0\u00a0 We could just have easily used any of the following,...\u00a0...The letter we use does not matter.\u00a0 What is important is the \u201c ...\u201d part.\u00a0 The letter in the parenthesis must match the variable used on the right side of the equal sign....\u00a0...It is very important to note that ...\u00a0is really nothing more than a really fancy way of writing ....\u00a0 If you keep that in mind you may find that dealing with function notation becomes a little easier. ...\u00a0...Also, this is ... a multiplication of\u00a0 ... by ...!\u00a0 This is one of the more common mistakes people make when they first deal with functions.\u00a0 This is just a notation used to denote functions....\u00a0...Next we need to talk about ....\u00a0 Evaluating a function is really nothing more than asking what its value is for specific values of ....\u00a0 Another way of looking at it is that we are asking what the ... value for a given ... is.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Evaluation is really quite simple.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take the function we were looking at above...and ask what its value is for ....\u00a0 In terms of function notation we will \u201cask\u201d this using the notation ....\u00a0 So, when there is something other than the variable inside the parenthesis we are really asking what the value of the function is for that particular quantity....\u00a0...Now, when we say the value of the function we are really asking what the value of the equation is for that particular value of ....\u00a0 Here is .......\u00a0...Notice that evaluating a function is done in exactly the same way in which we evaluate equations.\u00a0 All we do is plug in for ... whatever is on the inside of the parenthesis on the left.\u00a0 Here\u2019s another evaluation for this function....\u00a0...So, again, whatever is on the inside of the parenthesis on the left is plugged in for ... in the equation on the right.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at some more examples....\u00a0...Given   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0evaluate each of the following....\u00a0and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0and ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...   ...Okay we\u2019ve got two function evaluations to do here and   we\u2019ve also got two functions so we\u2019re going to need to decide which function   to use for the evaluations.\u00a0 The key   here is to notice the letter that is in front of the parenthesis.\u00a0 For ...\u00a0we will use the function ...\u00a0and for ...\u00a0we will use ....\u00a0 In other words, we just need to make sure   that the variables match up....\u00a0...Here are the evaluations for this part....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...   ...This one is pretty much the same as the previous part with   one exception that we\u2019ll touch on when we reach that point.\u00a0 Here are the evaluations....Make sure that you deal with the negative signs properly   here.\u00a0 Now the second one....We\u2019ve now reached the difference.\u00a0 Recall that when we first started talking   about the definition of functions we stated that we were only going to deal   with real numbers.\u00a0 In other words, we   only plug in real numbers and we only want real numbers back out as answers.\u00a0 So, since we would get a complex number out   of this we can\u2019t plug -10 into this function....\u00a0... ...Not much to this one....Again, don\u2019t forget that this isn\u2019t multiplication!\u00a0 For some reason students like to think of this   one as multiplication and get an answer of zero.\u00a0 Be careful....\u00a0... ...The rest of these evaluations are now going to be a little   different.\u00a0 As this one shows we don\u2019t   need to just have numbers in the parenthesis.\u00a0   However, evaluation works in exactly the same way.\u00a0 We plug into the ...\u2019s on the right side of the equal sign whatever is in the   parenthesis.\u00a0 In this case that means   that we plug in ... for all the ...\u2019s....\u00a0...Here is this evaluation....\u00a0...Note that in this case this is pretty much the same thing   as our original function, except this time we\u2019re using ... as a variable....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...   ...\u00a0Now, let\u2019s get a   little more complicated, or at least they appear to be more complicated.\u00a0 Things aren\u2019t as bad as they may appear   however.\u00a0 We\u2019ll evaluate ...\u00a0first.\u00a0   This one works exactly the same as the previous part did.\u00a0 All the ...\u2019s   on the left will get replaced with ....\u00a0 We will have some simplification to do as   well after the substitution....\u00a0...\u00a0...Be careful with parenthesis in these kinds of   evaluations.\u00a0 It is easy to mess up   with them....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at ....\u00a0 With the exception of the ... this is identical to ...\u00a0and so it works exactly the same way....\u00a0...\u00a0...Do not get excited about the fact that we reused ...\u2019s in the evaluation here.\u00a0 In many places where we will be doing this   in later sections there will be ...\u2019s   here and so you will need to get used to seeing that....\u00a0... ...Again, don\u2019t get excited about the ...\u2019s in the parenthesis here.\u00a0   Just evaluate it as if it were a number....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...One more evaluation and this time we\u2019ll use the other   function....\u00a0...\u00a0...Function evaluation is something that we\u2019ll be doing a lot of in later sections and chapters so make sure that you can do it.\u00a0 You will find several later sections very difficult to understand and/or do the work in if you do not have a good grasp on how function evaluation works....\u00a0...While we are on the subject of function evaluation we should now talk about ....\u00a0 We\u2019ve actually already seen an example of a piecewise function even if we didn\u2019t call it a function (or a piecewise function) at the time.\u00a0 Recall the mathematical definition of absolute value....\u00a0...This is a function and if we use function notation we can write it as follows,...\u00a0...This is also an example of a piecewise function.\u00a0 A piecewise function is nothing more than a function that is broken into pieces and which piece you use depends upon value of ....\u00a0 So, in the absolute value example we will use the top piece if ... is positive or zero and we will use the bottom piece if ... is negative....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at evaluating a more complicated piecewise function....\u00a0...Given,   ...evaluate each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Before starting the evaluations here let\u2019s notice that   we\u2019re using different letters for the function and variable than the ones   that we\u2019ve used to this point.\u00a0 That   won\u2019t change how the evaluation works.\u00a0   Do not get so locked into seeing ...   for the function and ... for the   variable that you can\u2019t do any problem that doesn\u2019t have those letters....\u00a0...Now, to do each of these evaluations the first thing that   we need to do is determine which inequality the number satisfies, and it will   only satisfy a single inequality.\u00a0 When   we determine which inequality the number satisfies we use the equation   associated with that inequality....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s do some evaluations....\u00a0... ...In this case -6 satisfies the top inequality and so we\u2019ll   use the top equation for this evaluation....\u00a0... ...Now we\u2019ll need to be a little careful with this one since   -4 shows up in two of the inequalities.\u00a0   However, it only satisfies the top inequality and so we will once   again use the top function for the evaluation....\u00a0... ...In this case the number, 1, satisfies the middle   inequality and so we\u2019ll use the middle equation for the evaluation.\u00a0 This evaluation often causes problems for   students despite the fact that it\u2019s actually one of the easiest evaluations   we\u2019ll ever do.\u00a0 We know that we   evaluate functions/equations by plugging in the number for the variable.\u00a0 In this case there are no variables.\u00a0 That isn\u2019t a problem.\u00a0 Since there aren\u2019t any variables it just   means that we don\u2019t actually plug in anything and we get the following,...\u00a0... ...Again, like with the second part we need to be a little   careful with this one.\u00a0 In this case   the number satisfies the middle inequality since that is the one with the   equal sign in it.\u00a0 Then like the   previous part we just get,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t get excited about the fact that the previous two   evaluations were the same value.\u00a0 This   will happen on occasion....\u00a0... ...For the final evaluation in this example the number   satisfies the bottom inequality and so we\u2019ll use the bottom equation for the   evaluation....\u00a0...Piecewise functions do not arise all that often in an Algebra class however, the do arise in several places in later classes and so it is important for you to understand them if you are going to be moving on to more math classes....\u00a0...As a final topic we need to come back and touch on the fact that we can\u2019t always plug every ... into every function.\u00a0 We talked briefly about this when we gave the definition of the function and we saw an example of this when we were evaluating functions.\u00a0 We now need to look at this in a little more detail....\u00a0...First we need to get a couple of definitions out of the way.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...The ... of   an equation is the set of all ...\u2019s   that we can plug into the equation and get back a real number for ....\u00a0   The ... of an equation is   the set of all ...\u2019s that we can ever   get out of the equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that we did mean to use equation in the definitions above instead of functions.\u00a0 These are really definitions for equations.\u00a0 However, since functions are also equations we can use the definitions for functions as well....\u00a0...Determining the range of an equation/function can be pretty difficult to do for many functions and so we aren\u2019t going to really get into that.\u00a0 We are much more interested here in determining the domains of functions.\u00a0 From the definition the domain is the set of all ...\u2019s that we can plug into a function and get back a real number.\u00a0 At this point, that means that we need to avoid division by zero and taking square roots of negative numbers....\u00a0...Let\u2019s do a couple of quick examples of finding domains....\u00a0...Determine   the domain of each of the following functions....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The domains for these functions are all the values of ... for which we don\u2019t have division by   zero or the square root of a negative number.\u00a0   If we remember these two ideas finding the domains will be pretty   easy....\u00a0... ...So, in this case there are no square roots so we don\u2019t   need to worry about the square root of a negative number.\u00a0 There is however a possibility that we\u2019ll   have a division by zero error.\u00a0 To determine   if we will we\u2019ll need to set the denominator equal to zero and solve....\u00a0...So, we will get division by zero if we plug in ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 That means that we\u2019ll need to avoid those   two numbers.\u00a0 However, all the other   values of ... will work since they   don\u2019t give division by zero.\u00a0 The   domain is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...In this case we won\u2019t have division by zero problems since   we don\u2019t have any fractions.\u00a0 We do   have a square root in the problem and so we\u2019ll need to worry about taking the   square root of a negative numbers....\u00a0...This one is going to work a little differently from the   previous part.\u00a0 In that part we   determined the value(s) of ... to   avoid.\u00a0 In this case it will be just as   easy to directly get the domain.\u00a0 To   avoid square roots of negative numbers all that we need to do is require that   ...\u00a0...This is a fairly simple linear inequality that we should   be able to solve at this point....The domain of this function is then,...\u00a0... ...In this case we\u2019ve got a fraction, but notice that the   denominator will never be zero for any real number since ... is guaranteed to be positive or zero and adding 4   onto this will mean that the denominator is always at least 4.\u00a0 In other words, the denominator won\u2019t ever   be zero.\u00a0 So, all we need to do then is   worry about the square root in the numerator....\u00a0...To do this we\u2019ll require,...\u00a0...Now, we can actually plug in any value of ... into the denominator, however, since   we\u2019ve got the square root in the numerator we\u2019ll have to make sure that all ...\u2019s satisfy the inequality above to   avoid problems.\u00a0 Therefore, the domain   of this function is ... ...In this final part we\u2019ve got both a square root and   division by zero to worry about.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   take care of the square root first since this will probably put the largest   restriction on the values of ....\u00a0 So, to keep the square root happy (... no square root of negative   numbers) we\u2019ll need to require that,...\u00a0...So, at the least we\u2019ll need to require that ...\u00a0in order to avoid problems with the square   root. ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s see if we have any division by zero   problems.\u00a0 Again, to do this simply set   the denominator equal to zero and solve....\u00a0...Now, notice that ...\u00a0doesn\u2019t satisfy the inequality we need for   the square root and so that value of ...   has already been excluded by the square root.\u00a0   On the other hand ...\u00a0does satisfy the inequality.\u00a0 This means that it is okay to plug ...\u00a0into the square root, however, since it   would give division by zero we will need to avoid it....\u00a0...The domain for this function is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/FunctionDefn.aspx", "media": "text",

identical to the process for solving ... with a few minor differences....\u00a0...Let\u2019s just jump straight into some examples....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...Before we get into solving these we need to point out that   these DON\u2019T solve in the same way that we\u2019ve solve equations that contained   rational expressions.\u00a0 With equations   the first thing that we always did was clear out the denominators by   multiplying by the least common denominator.\u00a0   That won\u2019t work with these however.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...Since we don\u2019t know the value of ... we can\u2019t multiply both sides by anything that contains an ....\u00a0   Recall that if we multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative   number we will need to switch the direction of the inequality.\u00a0 However, since we don\u2019t know the value of ... we don\u2019t know if the denominator is   positive or negative and so we won\u2019t know if we need to switch the direction   of the inequality or not.\u00a0 In fact, to   make matters worse, the denominator will be both positive and negative for   values of ... in the solution and so   that will create real problems....\u00a0...So, we need to leave the rational expression in the   inequality....\u00a0...Now, the basic process here is the same as with polynomial   inequalities.\u00a0 The first step is to get   a zero on one side and write the other side as a single rational   inequality.\u00a0 This has already been done   for us here....\u00a0...The next step is to factor the numerator and denominator   as much as possible.\u00a0 Again, this has   already been done for us in this case....\u00a0...The next step is to determine where both the numerator and   the denominator are zero.\u00a0 In this case   these values are....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, we need these numbers for a couple of reasons.\u00a0\u00a0 First, just like with polynomial   inequalities these are the only numbers where the rational expression ... change sign.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll build a number line using these   points to define ranges out of which to pick test points just like we did   with polynomial inequalities....\u00a0...There is another reason for needing the value of ... that make the denominator zero   however.\u00a0 No matter what else is going   on here we do have a rational expression and that means we need to avoid   division by zero and so knowing where the denominator is zero will give us   the values of ... to avoid for this....\u00a0...Here is the number line for this inequality....\u00a0...So, we need regions that make the rational expression   negative.\u00a0 That means the middle   region.\u00a0 Also, since we\u2019ve got an \u201cor   equal to\u201d part in the inequality we also need to include where the inequality   is zero, so this means we include ....\u00a0 Notice that we will also need to avoid ...\u00a0since that gives division by zero....\u00a0...The solution for this inequality is,...\u00a0...Solve   .......We\u2019ve got zero on one side so let\u2019s first factor the   numerator and determine where the numerator and denominator are both zero....\u00a0...Here is the number line for this one....\u00a0...In the problem we are after values of ... that make the inequality strictly positive and so that looks   like the second and fourth region and we won\u2019t include any of the endpoints here.\u00a0 The solution is then,...\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0.......There really isn\u2019t too much to this example.\u00a0 We\u2019ll first need to factor the numerator   and then determine where the numerator and denominator are zero....\u00a0...The number line for this problem is,...So, as with the polynomial inequalities we can just assume   that the regions will always alternate in sign.\u00a0 Also, note that while the middle two   regions do give negative values in the rational expression we need to avoid ...\u00a0to make sure we don\u2019t get division by   zero.\u00a0 This means that we will have to   write the answer as two inequalities and/or intervals....\u00a0...Once again, it\u2019s important to note that we really do need to test each region and not just assume that the regions will alternate in sign....\u00a0...Next we need to take a look at some examples that don\u2019t already have a zero on one side of the inequality....\u00a0...Solve   .......The first thing that we need to do here is subtract 1 from   both sides and then get everything into a single rational expression....\u00a0...In this case there is no factoring to do so we can go   straight to identifying where the numerator and denominator are zero....\u00a0...\u00a0...Here is the number line for this problem....Okay, we want values of ...   that give positive and/or zero in the rational expression.\u00a0 This looks like the outer two regions as   well as ....\u00a0 As with the first example we will need to   avoid ...\u00a0since that will give a division by zero   error....\u00a0...The solution for this problem is then,...\u00a0...Solve   .......So, again, the first thing to do is to get a zero on one   side and then get everything into a single rational expression....\u00a0...We also factored the numerator above so we can now   determine where the numerator and denominator are zero....\u00a0...\u00a0...Here is the

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "It is now time to look at solving some more difficult inequalities.\u00a0 In this section we will be solving (single) inequalities that involve polynomials of degree at least two.\u00a0 Or, to put it in other words, the polynomials won\u2019t be linear any more.\u00a0 Just as we saw when solving equations the process that we have for solving linear inequalities just won\u2019t work here....\u00a0...Since it\u2019s easier to see the process as we work an example let\u2019s do that.\u00a0 As with the linear inequalities, we are looking for all the values of the variable that will make the inequality true.\u00a0 This means that our solution will almost certainly involve inequalities as well.\u00a0 The process that we\u2019re going to go through will give the answers in that form....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...There is a fairly simple process to solving these.\u00a0 If you can remember it you\u2019ll always be   able to solve these kinds of inequalities....\u00a0...Get   a zero on one side of the inequality.\u00a0   It doesn\u2019t matter which side has the zero, however, we\u2019re going to be   factoring in the next step so keep that in mind as you do this step.\u00a0 Make sure that you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s   going to be easy to factor....\u00a0...\u00a0...If   possible, factor the polynomial.\u00a0 Note   that it won\u2019t always be possible to factor this, but that won\u2019t change   things.\u00a0 This step is really here to   simplify the process more than anything.\u00a0   Almost all of the problems that we\u2019re going to look at will be   factorable....\u00a0...\u00a0...Determine   where the polynomial is zero.\u00a0 Notice   that these points won\u2019t make the inequality true (in this case) because ...\u00a0is NOT a true inequality.\u00a0 That isn\u2019t a problem.\u00a0 These points are going to allow us to find   the actual solution....\u00a0...In our case the polynomial will be zero at ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Now, before moving on to the next step let\u2019s address why   we want these points.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We haven\u2019t discussed graphing polynomials yet, however,   the graphs of polynomials are nice smooth functions that have no breaks in   them.\u00a0 This means that as we are moving   across the number line (in any direction) if the value of the polynomial   changes sign (say from positive to negative) then it MUST go through zero! ...\u00a0...So, that means that these two numbers (...   and ...) are the ONLY places where the   polynomial can change sign.\u00a0 The number   line is then divided into three regions.\u00a0   In each region if the inequality is satisfied by one point from that   region then it is satisfied for ALL points in that region.\u00a0 If this wasn\u2019t true (... it was positive at one point in the region and negative at   another) then it must also be zero somewhere in that region, but that can\u2019t   happen as we\u2019ve already determined all the places where the polynomial can be   zero!\u00a0 Likewise, if the inequality   isn\u2019t satisfied for some point in that region that it isn\u2019t satisfied for ANY   point in that region....\u00a0...This leads us into the next step....\u00a0...Graph   the points where the polynomial is zero (...   the points from the previous step) on a number line and pick a ... from each of the   regions.\u00a0 Plug each of these test   points into the polynomial and determine the sign of the polynomial at that   point....\u00a0...This is the step in the process that has all the work,   although it isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0 Here is the   number line for this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s talk about this a little.\u00a0 When we pick test points make sure that you   pick easy numbers to work with.\u00a0 So,   don\u2019t choose large numbers or fractions unless you are forced to by the   problem.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, note that we plugged the test points into the   factored from of the polynomial and all we\u2019re really after here is whether or   not the polynomial is positive or negative.\u00a0   Therefore, we didn\u2019t actually bother with values of the polynomial   just the sign and we can get that from the product shown.\u00a0 The product of two negatives is a positive,   .......\u00a0...We are now ready for the final step in the process....\u00a0...Write   down the answer.\u00a0 Recall that we   discussed earlier that if any point from a region satisfied the inequality   then ALL points in that region satisfied the inequality and likewise if any   point from a region did not satisfy the inequality then NONE of the points in   that region would satisfy the inequality....\u00a0...This means that all we need to do is look up at the number   line above.\u00a0 If the test point from a   region satisfies the inequality then that region is part of the solution.\u00a0 If the test point doesn\u2019t satisfy the   inequality then that region isn\u2019t part of the solution....\u00a0...Now, also notice that any value of ... that will satisfy the original inequality will also satisfy the   inequality from Step 2 and likewise, if an ... satisfies the inequality from Step 2 then it will satisfy the   original inequality....\u00a0...So, that means that all we need to do is determine the   regions in which the polynomial from Step 2 is negative.\u00a0 For this problem that is only the middle   region.\u00a0 The inequality and interval   notation for the solution to this inequality are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that we do need to exclude the endpoints since we   have a strict inequality (< in this case) in the inequality....\u00a0...Okay, that seems like a long process, however, it really isn\u2019t.\u00a0 There was lots of explanation in the previous example.\u00a0 The remaining examples won\u2019t be as long because we won\u2019t need quite as much explanation in them....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...Okay, this time we\u2019ll just go through the process without   all the explanations and steps.\u00a0 The   first thing to do is get a zero on one side and factor the polynomial if   possible....\u00a0...So, the polynomial will be zero at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Notice as well that unlike the previous   example, these will be solutions to the inequality since we\u2019ve got a \u201cgreater   than or equal to\u201d in the inequality....\u00a0...Here is the number line for this example....Notice that in this case we were forced to choose a   decimal for one of the test points....\u00a0...Now, we want regions where the polynomial will be   positive.\u00a0 So, the first and last   regions will be part of the solution.\u00a0   Also, in this case, we\u2019ve got an \u201cor equal to\u201d in the inequality and   so we\u2019ll need to include the endpoints in our solution since at this points   we get zero for the inequality and ...\u00a0is a true inequality....\u00a0...Here is the solution in both inequality and interval   notation form....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...Again, we\u2019ll just jump right into the problem.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already got zero on one side so we   can go straight to factoring....\u00a0...So, this polynomial is zero at ...,   ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Here is the number line for this problem....First, notice that unlike the first two examples these   regions do NOT alternate between positive and negative.\u00a0 This is a common mistake that students make.\u00a0 You really do need to plug in test points   from each region.\u00a0 Don\u2019t ever just plug   in for the first region and then assume that the other regions will alternate   from that point....\u00a0...Now, for our solution we want regions where the polynomial   will be negative (that\u2019s the middle two here) or zero (that\u2019s all three   points that divide the regions).\u00a0 So,   we can combine up the middle two regions and the three points into a single   inequality in this case.\u00a0 The solution,   in both inequality and interval notation form, is....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...The first couple of steps have already been done for us   here.\u00a0 So, we can just straight into   the work.\u00a0 This polynomial will be zero   at ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Here is the number line for this problem....Again, note that the regions don\u2019t alternate in sign!...\u00a0...For our solution to this inequality we are looking for   regions where the polynomial is positive (that\u2019s the last two in this case),   however we don\u2019t want values where the polynomial is zero this time since   we\u2019ve got a strict inequality (>) in this problem.\u00a0 This means that we want the last two   regions, but not .......\u00a0...So, unlike the previous example we can\u2019t just combine up   the two regions into a single inequality since that would include a point   that isn\u2019t part of the solution.\u00a0 Here   is the solution for this problem....\u00a0...Now, all of the examples that we\u2019ve worked to this point involved factorable polynomials.\u00a0 However, that doesn\u2019t have to be the case.\u00a0 We can work these inequalities even if the polynomial doesn\u2019t factor.\u00a0 We should work one of these just to show you how they work....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...In this case the polynomial doesn\u2019t factor so we can\u2019t do   that step.\u00a0 However, we do still need   to know where the polynomial is zero.\u00a0   We will have to use the quadratic formula for that.\u00a0 Here is what the quadratic formula gives   us....In order to work the problem we\u2019ll need to reduce this to   decimals....\u00a0...From this point on the process is identical to the   previous examples.\u00a0 In the number line   below the dashed lines are at the approximate values of the two decimals above   and the inequalities show the value of the quadratic evaluated at the test   points shown....\u00a0...So, it looks like we need the two outer regions for the   solution.\u00a0 Here is the inequality and   interval notation for the solution.",

Also we will always use a positive value for distance.\u00a0 Consider the following number line....\u00a0...From this we can get the following values of absolute value....\u00a0...All that we need to do is identify the point on the number line and determine its distance from the origin.\u00a0 Note as well that we also have .......\u00a0...We can also give a strict mathematical/formula definition for absolute value.\u00a0 It is,...\u00a0...This tells us to look at the sign of ... and if it\u2019s positive we just drop the absolute value bar.\u00a0 If ... is negative we drop the absolute value bars and then put in a negative in front of it....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s see a couple of quick examples....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that these give exactly the same value as if we\u2019d used the geometric interpretation....\u00a0...One way to think of absolute value is that it takes a number and makes it positive.\u00a0 In fact we can guarantee that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...regardless of the value of .......\u00a0...We do need to be careful however to not misuse either of these definitions.\u00a0 For example we can\u2019t use the definition on ...because we don\u2019t know the value of .......\u00a0...Also, don\u2019t make the mistake of assuming that absolute value just makes all minus signs into plus signs.\u00a0 In other words, don\u2019t make the following mistake,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This just isn\u2019t true!\u00a0 If you aren\u2019t sure that you believe that plug in a number for ....\u00a0 For example if ...\u00a0we would get,...\u00a0...\u00a0...There are a couple of problems with this.\u00a0 First, the numbers are clearly not the same and so that\u2019s all we really need to prove that the two expressions aren\u2019t the same.\u00a0 There is also the fact however that the right number is negative and we will never get a negative value out of an absolute value! \u00a0That also will guarantee that these two expressions aren\u2019t the same....\u00a0...The definitions above are easy to apply if all we\u2019ve got are numbers inside the absolute value bars.\u00a0 However, once we put variables inside them we\u2019ve got to start being very careful....\u00a0...It\u2019s now time to start thinking about how to solve equations that contain absolute values.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start off fairly simple and look at the following equation....\u00a0...Now, if we think of this from a geometric point of view this means that whatever ... is it must have a distance of 4 from the origin.\u00a0 Well there are only two numbers that have a distance of 4 from the origin, namely 4 and -4.\u00a0 So, there are two solutions to this equation,...\u00a0...Now, if you think about it we can do this for any positive number, not just 4.\u00a0 So, this leads to the following general formula for equations involving absolute value....\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that this does ... the ... be a positive number.\u00a0 We will deal with what happens if ... is zero or negative in a bit....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Now, remember that absolute value does not just make all   minus signs into plus signs!\u00a0 To solve   these we\u2019ve got to use the formula above since in all cases the number on the   right side of the equal sign is positive....\u00a0... ...There really isn\u2019t much to do here other than using the   formula from above as noted above.\u00a0 All   we need to note is that in the ... ... represents whatever is on the inside   of the absolute value bars and so in this case we have,...\u00a0...\u00a0...At this point we\u2019ve got two linear equations that are easy   to solve....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we\u2019ve got two solutions to the equation ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...This one is pretty much the same as the previous part so   we won\u2019t put as much detail into this one....The two solutions to this equation are ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...Again, not much more to this one....\u00a0...In this case the two solutions are ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at how to deal with equations for which ... is zero or negative.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do this with an example....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following.... Let\u2019s   approach this one from a geometric standpoint.\u00a0 This is saying that the quantity in the   absolute value bars has a distance of zero from the origin.\u00a0 There is only one number that has the   property and that is zero itself.\u00a0 So,   we must have,...In this case we get a single solution....\u00a0... Now, in   this case let\u2019s recall that we noted at the start of this section that ....\u00a0 In other words, we can\u2019t get a negative   value out of the absolute value.\u00a0 That   is exactly what this equation is saying however.\u00a0 Since this isn\u2019t possible that means there   is ... to this equation....\u00a0...So, summarizing we can see that if ... is zero then we can just drop the absolute value bars and solve the equation.\u00a0 Likewise, if ... is negative then there will be no solution to the equation....\u00a0...To this point we\u2019ve only looked at equations that involve an absolute value being equal to a number, but there is no reason to think that there has to only be a number on the other side of the equal sign.\u00a0 Likewise, there is no reason to think that we can only have one absolute value in the problem.\u00a0 So, we need to take a look at a couple of these kinds of equations....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...At first glance the formula we used ...   will do us no good here.\u00a0 It requires   the right side of the equation to be a positive number.\u00a0 It turns out that we can still use it here,   but we\u2019re going to have to be careful with the answers as using this formula   will, on occasion introduce an incorrect answer.\u00a0 So, while we can use the formula we\u2019ll need   to make sure we check our solutions to see if they really work....\u00a0... ...So, we\u2019ll start off using the formula above as we have in   the previous problems and solving the two linear equations....\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ve got two potential answers here.\u00a0 There is a problem with the second one   however.\u00a0 If we plug this one into the   equation we get,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...We get the same   number on each side but with opposite signs.\u00a0   This will happen on occasion when we solve this kind of equation with   absolute values.\u00a0 Note that we really   didn\u2019t need to plug the solution into the whole equation here.\u00a0 All we needed to do was check the portion   without the absolute value and if it was negative then the potential solution   will NOT in fact be a solution and if it\u2019s positive or zero it will be solution....\u00a0...We\u2019ll leave it   to you to verify that the first potential solution does in fact work and so   there is a single solution to this equation : .......\u00a0... ...This one will work in pretty much the same way so we won\u2019t   put in quite as much explanation....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, before we   check each of these we should give a quick warning.\u00a0 Do not make the assumption that because the   first potential solution is negative it won\u2019t be a solution.\u00a0 We only exclude a potential solution if it   makes the portion without absolute value bars negative.\u00a0 In this case both potential solutions will   make the portion without absolute value bars positive and so both are in fact   solutions....\u00a0...So in this case, unlike the first example, we get two solutions   : ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...This\u00a0 case looks   very different from any of the previous problems we\u2019ve worked to this point   and in this case the formula we\u2019ve been using doesn\u2019t really work at   all.\u00a0 However, if we think about this a   little we can see that we\u2019ll still do something similar here to get a   solution....\u00a0...Both sides of the equation contain absolute values   and so the only way the two sides are equal will be if the two quantities   inside the absolute value bars are equal or equal but with opposite   signs.\u00a0 Or in other words, we must   have,...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we won\u2019t need to verify our solutions here as we did   in the previous two parts of this problem.\u00a0   Both with be solutions provided we solved the two equations   correctly.\u00a0 However, it will probably   be a good idea to verify them anyway just to show that the solution technique   we used here really did work properly....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first check .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the case the   quantities inside the absolute value were the same number but opposite   signs.\u00a0 However, upon taking the   absolute value we got the same number and so ...\u00a0is a solution.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s check .......\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the case we   got the same value inside the absolute value bars.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, as   suggested above both answers did in fact work and both are solutions to the   equation....\u00a0...So, as we\u2019ve seen in the previous set of examples we need to be a little careful if there are variables on both sides of the equal sign.\u00a0 If one side does not contain an absolute value then we need to look at the two potential answers and make sure that each is in fact a solution.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveAbsValueEqns.aspx", "media":

and so   is 10.2892 feet....\u00a0...Notice that the width is almost the second solution to the   quadratic equation.\u00a0 The only   difference is the minus sign.\u00a0 Do NOT   expect this to always happen.\u00a0 In this   case this is more of a function of the problem.\u00a0 For a more complicated set up this will NOT   happen....\u00a0...Now, from a physical standpoint we can see that we should expect to NOT get complex solutions to these problems.\u00a0 Upon solving the quadratic equation we should get either two real distinct solutions or a double root.\u00a0 Also, as the previous example has shown, when we get two real distinct solutions we will be able to eliminate one of them for physical reasons....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another example or two....\u00a0...Two   cars start out at the same point.\u00a0 One   car starts out driving north at 25 mph.\u00a0   Two hours later the second car starts driving east at 20 mph.\u00a0 How long after the first car starts   traveling does it take for the two cars to be 300 miles apart?...\u00a0...We\u2019ll start off by letting ... be the amount of time that the first car, let\u2019s call it car A,   travels.\u00a0 Since the second car, let\u2019s   call that car B, starts out two hours later then we know that it will travel   for ...\u00a0hours....\u00a0...Now, we know that the distance traveled by an object (or   car since that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with here) is its speed times time   traveled.\u00a0 So we have the following   distances traveled for each car....\u00a0...At this point a quick sketch of the situation is probably   in order so we can see just what is going on.\u00a0   In the sketch we will assume that the two cars have traveled long   enough so that they are 300 miles apart....So, we have a right triangle here.\u00a0 That means that we can use the Pythagorean   Theorem to say,...\u00a0...This is a quadratic equation, but it is going to need some   fairly heavy simplification before we can solve it so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Now, the coefficients here are quite large, but that is   just something that will happen fairly often with these problems so don\u2019t   worry about that.\u00a0 Using the quadratic formula   (and simplifying that answer) gives,...\u00a0...Again, we have two solutions and we\u2019re going to need to   determine which one is the correct one, so let\u2019s convert them to decimals....\u00a0...As with the previous example the negative answer just   doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u00a0 So, it looks   like the car A traveled for 10.09998 hours when they were finally 300 miles   apart....\u00a0...Also, even though the problem didn\u2019t ask for it, the   second car will have traveled for 8.09998 hours before they are 300 miles   apart.\u00a0 Notice as well that this is NOT   the second solution without the negative this time, unlike the first example....\u00a0...An   office has two envelope stuffing machines.\u00a0   Working together they can stuff a batch of envelopes in 2 hours.\u00a0 Working separately it will take the second   machine 1 hour longer than the first machine to stuff a batch of   envelopes.\u00a0 How long would it take each   machine to stuff a batch of envelopes by themselves?...\u00a0...Let ... be the   amount of time it takes the first machine (Machine A) to stuff a batch of   envelopes by itself.\u00a0 That means that   it will take the second machine (Machine B) ...\u00a0hours to stuff a batch of envelopes by   itself....\u00a0...The word equation for this problem is then,...\u00a0...We know the time spent working together (2 hours) so we   need to work rates of each machine.\u00a0   Here are those computations....\u00a0...Note that it\u2019s okay that the work rates contain ....\u00a0   In fact they will need to so we can solve for it!\u00a0 Plugging into the word equation gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, to solve we\u2019ll first need to clear denominators and   get the equation in standard form....\u00a0...Using the quadratic formula gives,...Converting to decimals gives,...\u00a0...Again, the negative doesn\u2019t make any sense and so Machine   A will work for 3.5616 hours to stuff a batch of envelopes by itself.\u00a0 Machine B will need 4.5616 hours to stuff a   batch of envelopes by itself.\u00a0 Again,   unlike the first example, note that the time for Machine B was NOT the second   solution from the quadratic without the minus sign.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/QuadraticApps.aspx", "media": "text", "title":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "To this point in this chapter we\u2019ve concentrated on solving equations.\u00a0 It is now time to switch gears a little and start thinking about solving inequalities.\u00a0 Before we get into solving inequalities we should go over a couple of the basics first....\u00a0...At this stage of your mathematical career it is assumed that you know that ...means that ... is some number that is strictly less that ....\u00a0 It is also assumed that you know that ...means that ... is some number that is either strictly bigger than ... or is exactly equal to ....\u00a0 Likewise it is assumed that you know how to deal with the remaining two inequalities. > (greater than) and ...\u00a0(less than or equal to)....\u00a0...What we want to discuss is some notational issues and some subtleties that sometimes get students when the really start working with inequalities.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, remember that when we say that ... is less than ... we mean that ... is to the left of ... on a number line.\u00a0 So,...is a true inequality....\u00a0...Next, don\u2019t forget how to correctly interpret ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 Both of the following are true inequalities....\u00a0...In the first case 4 is equal to 4 and so it is \u201cless than or equal\u201d to 4.\u00a0 In the second case -6 is strictly less than 4 and so it is \u201cless than or equal\u201d to 4.\u00a0 The most common mistake is to decide that the first inequality is not a true inequality.\u00a0 Also be careful to not take this interpretation and translate it to < and/or >.\u00a0 For instance,...is not a true inequality since 4 is equal to 4 and not strictly less than 4....\u00a0...Finally, we will be seeing many ... throughout this section and later sections so we can\u2019t forget about those.\u00a0 The following is a double inequality....\u00a0...In a double inequality we are saying that both inequalities must be simultaneously true.\u00a0 In this case 5 is definitely greater than -9 and at the same time is less than or equal to 6.\u00a0 Therefore, this double inequality is a true inequality....\u00a0...On the other hand,...is not a true inequality.\u00a0 While it is true that 5 is less than 20 (so the second inequality is true) it is not true that 5 is greater than or equal to 10 (so the first inequality is not true).\u00a0 If even one of the inequalities in a double inequality is not true then the whole inequality is not true.\u00a0 This point is more important than you might realize at this point.\u00a0 In a later section we will run across situations where many students try to combine two inequalities into a double inequality that simply can\u2019t be combined, so be careful....\u00a0...The next topic that we need to discuss is the idea of ....\u00a0 Interval notation is some very nice shorthand for inequalities and will be used extensively in the next few sections of this chapter....\u00a0...The best way to define interval notation is the following table.\u00a0 There are three columns to the table.\u00a0 Each row contains an inequality, a graph representing the inequality and finally the interval notation for the given inequality....\u00a0...Inequality...Graph...Interval Notation...\u00a0...Remember that a bracket, \u201c[\u201d or \u201c]\u201d, means that we include the endpoint while a parenthesis, \u201c(\u201d or \u201c)\u201d, means we don\u2019t include the endpoint....\u00a0...Now, with the first four inequalities in the table the interval notation is really nothing more than the graph without the number line on it.\u00a0 With the final four inequalities the interval notation is almost the graph, except we need to add in an appropriate infinity to make sure we get the correct portion of the number line.\u00a0 Also note that infinities NEVER get a bracket.\u00a0 They only get a parenthesis....\u00a0...We need to give one final note on interval notation before moving on to solving inequalities.\u00a0 Always remember that when we are writing down an interval notation for an inequality that the number on the left must be the smaller of the two....\u00a0...It\u2019s now time to start thinking about solving linear inequalities.\u00a0 We will use the following set of facts in our solving of inequalities.\u00a0 Note that the facts are given for <.\u00a0 We can however, write down an equivalent set of facts for the remaining three inequalities....\u00a0...\u00a0...These are nearly the same facts that we used to solve linear equations.\u00a0 The only real exception is the third fact.\u00a0 This is the important fact as it is often the most misused and/or forgotten fact in solving inequalities....\u00a0...If you aren\u2019t sure that you believe that the sign of ... matters for the second and third fact consider the following number example....\u00a0...I hope that we would all agree that this is a true inequality.\u00a0 Now multiply both sides by 2 and by -2....\u00a0...Sure enough, when multiplying by a positive number the direction of the inequality remains the same, however when multiplying by a negative number the direction of the inequality does change....\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s solve some inequalities.\u00a0 We will start off with inequalities that only have a single inequality in them.\u00a0 In other words, we\u2019ll hold off on solving double inequalities for the next set of examples....\u00a0...The thing that we\u2019ve got to remember here is that we\u2019re asking to determine all the values of the variable that we can substitute into the inequality and get a true inequality.\u00a0 This means that our solutions will, in most cases, be inequalities themselves....\u00a0...\u00a0...Solving   the following inequalities.\u00a0 Give both   inequality and interval notation forms of the solution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Solving single linear inequalities follow pretty much the   same process for solving linear equations.\u00a0   We will simplify both sides, get all the terms with the variable on   one side and the numbers on the other side, and then multiply/divide both   sides by the coefficient of the variable to get the solution.\u00a0 The one thing that you\u2019ve got to remember   is that if you multiply/divide by a negative number then switch the direction   of the inequality....\u00a0... ...There really isn\u2019t much to do here other than follow the   process outlined above....\u00a0...You did catch the fact that the direction of the   inequality changed here didn\u2019t you?\u00a0 We   divided by a \u201c-7\u201d and so we had to change the direction.\u00a0 The inequality form of the solution is ....\u00a0 The interval notation for this solution is,   .......\u00a0... ...Again, not much to do here....\u00a0...Now, with this inequality we ended up with the variable on   the right side when it more traditionally on the left side.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s switch things around to get the   variable onto the left side.\u00a0 Note   however, that we\u2019re going to need also switch the direction of the inequality   to make sure that we don\u2019t change the answer.\u00a0   So, here is the inequality notation for the inequality....\u00a0...The interval notation for the solution is .......\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s solve some double inequalities.\u00a0 The process here is similar in some ways to solving single inequalities and yet very different in other ways.\u00a0 Since there are two inequalities there isn\u2019t any way to get the variables on \u201cone side\u201d of the inequality and the numbers on the other.\u00a0 It is easier to see how these work if we do an example or two so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following inequalities.\u00a0   Give both inequality and interval notation forms for the solution....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...The process here is fairly similar to the process for   single inequalities, but we will first need to be careful in a couple of   places.\u00a0 Our first step in this case   will be to clear any parenthesis in the middle term....\u00a0...Now, we want the ...   all by itself in the middle term and only numbers in the two outer terms.\u00a0 To do this we will   add/subtract/multiply/divide as needed.\u00a0   The only thing that we need to remember here is that if we do   something to middle term we need to do the same thing to BOTH of the out   terms.\u00a0 One of the more common mistakes   at this point is to add something, for example, to the middle and only add it   to one of the two sides....\u00a0...Okay, we\u2019ll add 10 to all three parts and then divide all   three parts by two....\u00a0...That is the inequality form of the answer.\u00a0 The interval notation form of the answer is   .......\u00a0... ...In this case the first thing that we need to do is clear   fractions out by multiplying all three parts by 2.\u00a0 We will then proceed as we did in the first   part....\u00a0...Now, we\u2019re not quite done here, but we need to be very   careful with the next step.\u00a0 In this   step we need to divide all three parts by -3.\u00a0   However, recall that whenever we divide both sides of an inequality by   a negative number we need to switch the direction of the inequality.\u00a0 For us, this means that both of the   inequalities will need to switch direction here....\u00a0...So, there is the inequality form of the solution.\u00a0 We will need to be careful with the   interval notation for the solution.\u00a0   First, the interval notation is NOT ....\u00a0 Remember that in interval notation the   smaller number must always go on the left side!\u00a0 Therefore, the correct interval notation   for the solution is .......\u00a0...Note as well that this does match up with the inequality   form of the solution as well.\u00a0 The   inequality is telling us that ... is   any number between 4 and ...\u00a0or possibly ...\u00a0itself and this is exactly what the interval   notation is telling us.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Also, the inequality could be flipped around to get the   smaller number on the left if we\u2019d like to.\u00a0   Here is that form,...When doing this make sure to correctly deal with the   inequalities as well....\u00a0... ...Not much to this one.\u00a0   We\u2019ll proceed as we\u2019ve done the previous two....\u00a0...\u00a0...Don\u2019t get excited about the fact that one of the sides is   now zero.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t a problem.\u00a0 Again, as with the last part, we\u2019ll be   dividing by a negative number and so don\u2019t forget to switch the direction of   the inequalities....\u00a0...\u00a0...Either of the inequalities in the second row will work for   the solution.\u00a0 The interval notation of   the solution is .......\u00a0...When solving double inequalities make sure to pay attention to the inequalities that are in the original problem.\u00a0 One of the more common mistakes here is to start with a problem in which one of the inequalities is < or > and the other is ...\u00a0or ..., as we had in the first two parts of the previous example, and then by the final answer they are both < or > or they are both ...\u00a0or ....\u00a0 In other words, it is easy to all of a sudden make both of the inequalities the same.\u00a0 Be careful with this....\u00a0...There is one final example that we want to work here....\u00a0...If   ...\u00a0then determine ... and ... in .......\u00a0...This is easier than it may appear at first.\u00a0 All we are really going to do is start with   the given inequality and then manipulate the middle term to look like the   second inequality.\u00a0 Again, we\u2019ll need   to remember that whatever we do to the middle term we\u2019ll also need to do to   the two outer terms....\u00a0...So, first we\u2019ll multiply everything by 2....Now add 3 to everything....\u00a0...We\u2019ve now got the middle term identical to the second   inequality in the problems statement and so all we need to do is pick off ... and ....\u00a0 From this inequality we   can see that ...\u00a0and ....", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveLinearInequalities.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Linear Inequalities",

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "The title of this section is maybe a little misleading.\u00a0 The title seems to imply that we\u2019re going to look at equations that involve any radicals.\u00a0 However, we are going to restrict ourselves to equations involving square roots.\u00a0 The techniques we are going to apply here can be used to solve equations with other radicals, however the work is usually significantly messier than when dealing with square roots.\u00a0 Therefore, we will work only with square roots in this section....\u00a0...Before proceeding it should be mentioned as well that in some Algebra textbooks you will find this section in with the equations reducible to quadratic form material. The reason is that we will in fact end up solving a quadratic equation in most cases.\u00a0 However, the approach is significantly different and so we\u2019re going to separate the two topics into different sections in this course....\u00a0...It is usually best to see how these work with an example....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...In this equation the basic problem is the square   root.\u00a0 If that weren\u2019t there we could   do the problem.\u00a0 The whole process that   we\u2019re going to go through here is set up to eliminate the square root.\u00a0 However, as we will see, the steps that   we\u2019re going to take can actually cause problems for us.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s see how this all works....\u00a0...Let\u2019s notice that if we just square both sides we can make   the square root go away.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do that   and see what happens....\u00a0...\u00a0...Upon squaring both sides we see that we get a factorable   quadratic equation that gives us two solutions ...\u00a0and ....   ...\u00a0...Now, for no apparent reason, let\u2019s do something that we   haven\u2019t actually done since the section on solving linear equations.\u00a0 Let\u2019s check our answers.\u00a0 Remember as well that we need to check the   answers in the original equation!\u00a0 That   is very important....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first check ...\u00a0...So ...\u00a0is a solution.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s check .......\u00a0...We have a problem.\u00a0   Recall that square roots are ALWAYS positive and so ...\u00a0does not work in the original equation.\u00a0 One possibility here is that we made a   mistake somewhere.\u00a0 We can go back and   look however and we\u2019ll quickly see that we haven\u2019t made a mistake.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, what is the deal?\u00a0   Remember that our first step in the solution process was to square   both sides.\u00a0 Notice that if we plug ...\u00a0into the quadratic we solved it would in   fact be a solution to that.\u00a0 When we   squared both sides of the equation we actually changed the equation and in   the process introduced a solution that is not a solution to the original   equation....\u00a0...With these problems it is vitally important that you check   your solutions as this will often happen.\u00a0   When this does we only take the values that are actual solutions to   the original equation....\u00a0...So, the original equation had a single solution .......\u00a0...Now, as this example has shown us, we have to be very careful in solving these equations.\u00a0 When we solve the quadratic we will get two solutions and it is possible both of these, one of these, or none of these values to be solutions to the original equation.\u00a0 The only way to know is to check your solutions!...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple more examples that are a little more difficult....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...In this case let\u2019s notice that if we just square both   sides we\u2019re going to have problems....\u00a0...Before discussing the problem we\u2019ve got here let\u2019s make   sure you can do the squaring that we did above since it will show up on   occasion.\u00a0 All that we did here was use   the formula...with ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 You will need to be able to do these   because while this may not have worked here we will need to this kind of work   in the next set of problems....\u00a0...Now, just what is the problem with this?\u00a0 Well recall that the point behind squaring   both sides in the first problem was to eliminate the square root.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t done that.\u00a0 There is still a square root in the problem   and we\u2019ve made the remainder of the problem messier as well....\u00a0...So, what we\u2019re going to need to do here is make sure that   we\u2019ve got a square root all by itself on one side of the equation before   squaring.\u00a0 Once that is done we can   square both sides and the square root really will disappear....\u00a0...Here is the correct way to do this problem....\u00a0...As with the first example we will need to make sure and   check both of these solutions.\u00a0 Again,   make sure that you check in the original equation.\u00a0 Once we\u2019ve square both sides we\u2019ve changed   the problem and so checking there won\u2019t do us any good.\u00a0 In fact checking there could well lead us   into trouble....\u00a0...First .......So, that is a solution.\u00a0   Now .......\u00a0...So, as with the first example we worked there is in fact a   single solution to the original equation, .......\u00a0... ...Okay, so we will again need to get the square root on one   side by itself before squaring both sides....\u00a0...So, we have a double root this time.\u00a0 Let\u2019s check it to see if it really is a   solution to the original equation....So, ...\u00a0isn\u2019t a solution to the original   equation.\u00a0 Since this was the only   possible solution, this means that there are ... to the original equation.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t happen too often, but it does   happen so don\u2019t be surprised by it when it does....\u00a0... ...This one will work the same as the previous two....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check these possible solutions start with .......So, that\u2019s was a solution.\u00a0   Now let\u2019s check .......This was also a solution....\u00a0...So, in this case we\u2019ve now seen an example where both   possible solutions are in fact solutions to the original equation as well....\u00a0...So, as we\u2019ve seen in the previous set of examples once we get our list of possible solutions anywhere from none to all of them can be solutions to the original equation.\u00a0 Always remember to check your answers!...\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s work one more set of examples that have an added complexity to them.\u00a0 To this point all the equations that we\u2019ve looked at have had a single square root in them.\u00a0 However, there can be more than one square root in these equations.\u00a0 The next set of examples is designed to show us how to deal with these kinds of problems....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...In both of these there are two square roots in the   problem.\u00a0 We will work these in   basically the same manner however.\u00a0 The   first step is to get one of the square roots by itself on one side of the   equation then square both sides.\u00a0 At   this point the process is different so we\u2019ll see how to proceed from this   point once we reach it in the first example....\u00a0... ...So, the first thing to do is get one of the square roots   by itself.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter which one   we get by itself.\u00a0 We\u2019ll end up the   same solution(s) in the end.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Now, we still have a square root in the problem, but we   have managed to eliminate one of them.\u00a0   Not only that, but what we\u2019ve got left here is identical to the   examples we worked in the first part of this section.\u00a0 Therefore, we will continue now work this   problem as we did in the previous sets of examples....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s check both possible solutions in the original   equation.\u00a0 We\u2019ll start with ...So, the one is a solution.\u00a0   Now let\u2019s check .......So, they are both solutions to the original equation....\u00a0... ...In this case we\u2019ve already got a square root on one side   by itself so we can go straight to squaring both sides....\u00a0...Next, get the remaining square root back on one side by   itself and square both sides again....\u00a0...Now check both possible solutions starting with .......\u00a0...So, that wasn\u2019t a solution.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s check .......\u00a0...It looks like in this case we\u2019ve got a single solution, .......\u00a0...So, when there is more than one square root in the problem we are again faced with the task of checking our possible solutions.\u00a0 It is possible that anywhere

if we look at them in the correct light we can make them look like quadratic equations.\u00a0 At that point we can use the techniques we developed for quadratic equations to help us with the solution of the actual equation....\u00a0...It is usually best with these to show the process with an example so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s start off here by noticing that...In other words, we can notice here that the variable   portion of the first term (...   ignore the coefficient) is nothing more than the variable portion of the   second term squared.\u00a0 Note as well that   all we really needed to notice here is that the exponent on the first term   was twice the exponent on the first term....\u00a0...This, along with the fact that third term is a constant,   means that this equation is reducible to quadratic in form.\u00a0 We will solve this by first defining,...\u00a0...Now, this means that ...\u00a0...Therefore, we can write the equation in terms of ...\u2019s instead of ...\u2019s as follows,...\u00a0...\u00a0...The new equation (the one with the ...\u2019s) is a quadratic equation and we can solve that.\u00a0 In fact this equation is factorable, so the   solution is,...\u00a0...So, we get the two solutions shown above.\u00a0 These aren\u2019t the solutions that we\u2019re   looking for.\u00a0 We want values of ..., not values of ....\u00a0 That isn\u2019t really a   problem once we recall that we\u2019ve defined ...\u00a0...To get values of ...   for the solution all we need to do is plug in ... into this equation and solve that for ....\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s do that....\u00a0...So, we have four solutions to the original equation, ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0...So, the basic process is to check that the equation is reducible to quadratic in form then make a quick substitution to turn it into a quadratic equation.\u00a0 We solve the new equation for ..., the variable from the substitution, and then use these solutions and the substitution definition to get the solutions to the equation that we really want....\u00a0...In most cases to make the check that it\u2019s reducible to quadratic in form all that we really need to do is to check that one of the exponents is twice the other.\u00a0 There is one exception to this that we\u2019ll see here once we get into a set of examples....\u00a0...Also, once you get \u201cgood\u201d at these you often don\u2019t really need to do the substitution either.\u00a0 We will do them to make sure that the work is clear.\u00a0 However, these problems can be done without the substitution in many cases....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...Okay, in this case we can see that,...and so one of the exponents is twice the other so it looks   like we\u2019ve got an equation that is reducible to quadratic in form.\u00a0 The substitution will then be,...Substituting this into the equation gives,...\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve gotten the solutions for ... we can find values of .......\u00a0...So, we have two solutions here ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...For this part notice that,...and so we do have an equation that is reducible to   quadratic form.\u00a0 The substitution is,...The equation becomes,...\u00a0...Now, going back to ...\u2019s   is going to take a little more work here, but shouldn\u2019t be too bad....\u00a0...The two solutions to this equation are ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...This one is a little trickier to see that it\u2019s quadratic   in form, yet it is.\u00a0 To see this recall   that the exponent on the square root is one-half, then we can notice that the   exponent on the first term is twice the exponent on the second term.\u00a0 So, this equation is in fact reducible to   quadratic in form....\u00a0...Here is the substitution....\u00a0...The equation then becomes,...\u00a0...Now go back to ...\u2019s....The two solutions for this equation are ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0... ...Now, this part is the exception to the rule that we\u2019ve   been using to identify equations that are reducible to quadratic in   form.\u00a0 There is only one term with a ... in it.\u00a0 However, notice that we can write the   equation as,...So, if we use the substitution,...the equation becomes,...and so it is reducible to quadratic in form....\u00a0...Now, we can solve this using the square root   property.\u00a0 Doing that gives,...\u00a0...Now, going back to ...\u2019s   gives us,...\u00a0...In this case we get four solutions and two of them are complex   solutions.\u00a0 Getting complex solutions   out of these are actually more common that this set of examples might   suggest.\u00a0 The problem is that to get   some of the complex solutions requires knowledge that we haven\u2019t (and won\u2019t)   cover in this course.\u00a0 So, they don\u2019t   show up all that often....\u00a0...All of the examples to this point gave quadratic equations that were factorable or in the case of the last part of the previous example was an equation that we could use the square root property on.\u00a0 That need not always be the case however.\u00a0 It is more than possible that we would need the quadratic formula to do some of these.\u00a0 We should do an example of one of these just to make the point....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...In this case we can reduce this to quadratic in form by   using the substitution,...\u00a0...Using this substitution the equation becomes,...\u00a0...This doesn\u2019t factor and so we\u2019ll need to use the quadratic   formula on it.\u00a0 From the quadratic   formula the solutions are,...\u00a0...Now, in order to get back to ...\u2019s we are going to need decimals values for these so,...\u00a0...Now, using the substitution to get back to ...\u2019s gives the following,...\u00a0...Of course we had to use a calculator to get the final   answer for these.\u00a0 This is one of the   reasons that you don\u2019t tend to see too many of these done in an Algebra   class.\u00a0 The work and/or answers tend to   be a little messy.", "url":

....\u00a0 At this stage the coefficient of a variable   is simply all the stuff that multiplies the variable....\u00a0...\u00a0...To get a final answer we went ahead and flipped the order   to get the answer into a more \u201cstandard\u201d form....\u00a0...We will work more examples in a bit.\u00a0 However, let\u2019s note a couple things first.\u00a0 These problems tend to seem fairly difficult at first, but if you think about it all we really did was use exactly the same process we used to solve linear equations.\u00a0 The main difference of course, is that there is more \u201cmess\u201d in this process.\u00a0 That brings us to the second point.\u00a0 Do not get excited about the mess in these problems.\u00a0 The problems will, on occasion, be a little messy, but the steps involved are steps that you can do!\u00a0 Finally, the answer will not be a simple number, but again it will be a little messy, often messier than the original equation.\u00a0 That is okay and expected....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some more examples....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0for .......\u00a0...This one is fairly similar to the first example.\u00a0 However, it does work a little   differently.\u00a0 Recall from the first   example that we made the comment that sometimes the ordering of the steps in   the process needs to be changed?\u00a0 Well,   that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do here....\u00a0...The first step in the process tells us to clear   fractions.\u00a0 However, since the fraction   is inside a set of parenthesis let\u2019s first multiply the ... through the parenthesis.\u00a0   Notice as well that if we multiply the ... through first we will in fact clear one of the fractions out   automatically.\u00a0 This will make our work   a little easier when we do clear the fractions out.\u00a0 ...Now, clear fractions by multiplying both sides by ....\u00a0   We\u2019ll also go ahead move all terms that don\u2019t have an ... in them to the other side....Be careful to not lose the minus sign in front of the   5!\u00a0 It\u2019s very easy to lose track of   that.\u00a0 The final step is to then divide   both sides by the coefficient of the ...,   in this case .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice as well that we did some manipulation of the minus   sign that was in the denominator so that we could simplify the answer   somewhat....\u00a0...In the previous example we solved for ..., but there is no reason for not solving for one of the other variables in the problems.\u00a0 For instance, consider the following example....\u00a0...Solve   ...\u00a0for .......\u00a0...The first couple of steps are identical here.\u00a0 First, we will multiply the ... through the parenthesis and then we   will multiply both sides by ... to   clear the fractions.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already   done this work so from the previous example we have,...\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ve got ...\u2019s   on both sides of the equal sign and we need all terms with ...\u2019s in them on one side of the   equation and all other terms on the other side of the equation.\u00a0 In this case we can eliminate the minus   signs if we collect the ...\u2019s on the   left side and the other terms on the right side.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Now, both terms on the right side have a ... in them so if we factor that out of   both terms we arrive at,...\u00a0...Finally, divide by the coefficient of ....\u00a0 Recall as well that the   \u201ccoefficient\u201d is all the stuff that multiplies the ....\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...Solve

Divide the equation by the   coefficient of the ...   term.\u00a0 Recall that completing the   square required a coefficient of one on this term and this will guarantee   that we will get that.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need   to do that for this equation however....\u00a0...   Set the equation up so that the ...\u2019s   are on the left side and the constant is on the right side....\u00a0...\u00a0...   Complete the square on the left side.\u00a0   However, this time we will need to add the number to both sides of the   equal sign instead of just the left side.\u00a0   This is because we have to remember the rule that what we do to one   side of an equation we need to do to the other side of the equation....\u00a0...First, here is the number we add to both sides....Now, complete the square....\u00a0...   Now, at this point notice that we can use the square root property on this   equation.\u00a0 That was the purpose of the   first three steps.\u00a0 Doing this will   give us the solution to the equation....\u00a0...And that is the process.\u00a0   Let\u2019s do the remaining parts now....\u00a0... ...We will not explicitly put in the steps this time nor will   we put in a lot of explanation for this equation.\u00a0 This that being said, notice that we will   have to do the first step this time.\u00a0   We don\u2019t have a coefficient of one on the ... term and so we will need to divide the equation by   that first....\u00a0...Here is the work for this equation....\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget to convert square roots of negative numbers   to complex numbers!... ...Again, we won\u2019t put a lot of explanation for this problem....At this point we should be careful about computing the   number for completing the square since ...   is now a fraction for the first time....   ...Now finish the problem....In this case notice that we can actually do the arithmetic   here to get two integer and/or fractional solutions.\u00a0 We should always do this when there are   only integers and/or fractions in our solution.\u00a0 Here are the two solutions....\u00a0...A quick comment about the last equation that we solved in the previous example is in order.\u00a0 Since we received integer and factions as solutions, we could have just factored this equation from the start rather than used completing the square.\u00a0 In cases like this we could use either method and we will get the same result....\u00a0...Now, the reality is that completing the square is a fairly long process and it\u2019s easy to make mistakes.\u00a0 So, we rarely actually use it to solve equations.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t important to know the process however.\u00a0 We will be using it in several sections in later chapters and is often used in other classes....\u00a0...This is the final method for solving quadratic equations and will always work.\u00a0 Not only that, but if you can remember the formula it\u2019s a fairly simple process as well....\u00a0...We can derive the quadratic formula by completing the square on the general quadratic formula in standard form.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do that and we\u2019ll take it kind of slow to make sure all the steps are clear.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First, we MUST have the quadratic equation in standard form as already noted.\u00a0 Next, we need to divide both sides by ... to get a coefficient of one on the ... term....\u00a0...\u00a0...Next, move the constant to the right side of the equation....\u00a0...Now, we need to compute the number we\u2019ll need to complete the square.\u00a0 Again, this is one-half the coefficient of ..., squared....\u00a0...Now, add this to both sides, complete the square and get common denominators on the right side to simplify things up a little....\u00a0...Now we can use the square root property on this....\u00a0...Solve for ... and we\u2019ll also simplify the square root a little....\u00a0...As a last step we will notice that we\u2019ve got common denominators on the two terms and so we\u2019ll add them up.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...So, summarizing up, provided that we start off in standard form,...and that\u2019s very important, then the solution to any quadratic equation is,...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work a couple of examples....\u00a0...Use   the quadratic formula to solve each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...The important part here is to make sure that before we   start using the quadratic formula that we have the equation in standard form   first....\u00a0... ...So, the first thing that we need to do here is to put the   equation in standard form....\u00a0...At this point we can identify the values for use in the   quadratic formula.\u00a0 For this equation   we have....\u00a0...Notice the \u201c-\u201d with ....\u00a0 It is important to make sure that we carry   any minus signs along with the constants....\u00a0...At this point there really isn\u2019t anything more to do other   than plug into the formula....\u00a0...There are the two solutions for this equation.\u00a0 There is also some simplification that we   can do.\u00a0 We need to be careful   however.\u00a0 One of the larger mistakes at   this point is to \u201ccancel\u201d two 2\u2019s in the numerator and denominator.\u00a0 Remember that in order to cancel anything   from the numerator or denominator then it must be multiplied by the whole   numerator or denominator.\u00a0 Since the 2   in the numerator isn\u2019t multiplied by the whole denominator it can\u2019t be   canceled....\u00a0...In order to do any simplification here we will first need   to reduce the square root.\u00a0 At that   point we can do some canceling....\u00a0...That\u2019s a much nicer answer to deal with and so we will   almost always do this kind of simplification when it can be done....\u00a0... ...Now, in this case don\u2019t get excited about the fact that   the variable isn\u2019t an ....\u00a0 Everything works the same regardless of the   letter used for the variable.\u00a0 So,   let\u2019s first get the equation into standard form....\u00a0...Now, this isn\u2019t quite in the typical standard form.\u00a0 However, we need to make a point here so   that we don\u2019t make a very common mistake that many student make when first   learning the quadratic formula.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Many students will just get everything on one side as   we\u2019ve done here and then get the values of ..., ..., and ... based upon position.\u00a0 In other words, often students will just   let ... be the first number listed, ... be the second number listed and then   ... be the final number listed.\u00a0 This is not correct however.\u00a0 For the quadratic formula ... is the coefficient of the squared   term, ... is the coefficient of the   term with just the variable in it (not squared) and ... is the constant term.\u00a0   So, to avoid making this mistake we should always put the quadratic   equation into the official standard form....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now we can identify the value of ..., ..., and .......Again, be careful with minus signs.\u00a0 They need to get carried along with the   values....\u00a0...Finally, plug into the quadratic formula to get the   solution....\u00a0...\u00a0...As with all the other methods we\u2019ve looked at for solving   quadratic equations, don\u2019t forget to convert square roots of negative numbers   into complex numbers.\u00a0 Also, when ... is negative be very careful with the   substitution.\u00a0 This is particularly   true for the squared portion under the radical.\u00a0 Remember that when you square a negative   number it will become positive.\u00a0 One of   the more common mistakes here is to get in a hurry and forget to drop the   minus sign after you square ..., so   be careful....\u00a0... ...We won\u2019t put in quite the detail with this one that we\u2019ve   done for the first two.\u00a0 Here is the   standard form of this equation....Here are the values for the quadratic formula as well as   the quadratic formula itself....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, recall that when we get solutions like this we need   to go the extra step and actually determine the integer and/or fractional   solutions.\u00a0 In this case they are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, as with completing the square, the fact that we got   integer and/or fractional solutions means that we could have factored this   quadratic equation as well....\u00a0... ...So, an equation with fractions in it.\u00a0 The first step then is to identify the LCD....So, it looks like we\u2019ll need to make sure that neither ...\u00a0or ...\u00a0is in our answers so that we don\u2019t get   division by zero....\u00a0...Multiply both sides by the LCD and then put the result in   standard form....\u00a0...Okay, it looks like we\u2019ve got the following values for the   quadratic formula....\u00a0...Plugging into the quadratic formula gives,...Note that both of these are going to be solutions since neither   of them are the values that we need to avoid....\u00a0... ...We saw an equation similar to this in the previous section   when we were looking at factoring equations and it would definitely be easier   to solve this by factoring.\u00a0 However,   we are going to use the quadratic formula anyway to make a couple of points....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s rearrange the order a little bit just to make   it look more like the standard form....\u00a0...Here are the constants for use in the quadratic formula....\u00a0...There are two things to note about these values.\u00a0 First, we\u2019ve got a negative ... for the first time.\u00a0 Not a big deal, but it is the first time   we\u2019ve seen one.\u00a0 Secondly, and more   importantly, one of the values is zero.\u00a0   This is fine.\u00a0 It will happen on   occasion and in fact, having one of the values zero will make the work much   simpler.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Here is the quadratic formula for this equation....\u00a0...Reducing these to integers/fractions gives,...\u00a0...So we get the two solutions, ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 These are exactly the solutions we would   have gotten by factoring the equation....\u00a0...To this point in both this section and the previous section we have only looked at equations with integer coefficients.\u00a0 However, this doesn\u2019t have to be the case.\u00a0 We could have coefficient that are fractions or decimals.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s work a couple of examples so we can say that we\u2019ve seen something like that as well....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... There are two ways to work this one.\u00a0 We can either leave the fractions in or   multiply by the LCD (10 in this case) and solve that equation.\u00a0 Either way will give the same answer.\u00a0 We will only do the fractional case here   since that is the point of this problem.\u00a0   You should try the other way to verify that you get the same solution....\u00a0...In this case here are the values for the quadratic formula   as well as the quadratic formula work for this equation....\u00a0...In these cases we usually go the extra step of eliminating   the square root from the denominator so let\u2019s also do that,...\u00a0...If you do clear the fractions out and run through the   quadratic formula then you should get exactly the same result.\u00a0 For the practice you really should try   that....\u00a0... In this case do not get excited about the decimals.\u00a0 The quadratic formula works in exactly the   same manner.\u00a0 Here are the values and   the quadratic formula work for this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, to this will be the one difference between these   problems and those with integer or fractional coefficients.\u00a0 When we have decimal coefficients we   usually go ahead and figure the two individual numbers.\u00a0 So, let\u2019s do that,...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that we did use some rounding on the square root....\u00a0...Over the course of the last two sections we\u2019ve done quite a bit of solving.\u00a0 It is important that you understand most, if not all, of what we did in these sections as you will be asked to do this kind of work in some later sections.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveQuadraticEqnsII.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Quadratic Equations - Part II", "subject": "math"}},

done for the benefit of those viewing the material on the web.\u00a0 This is a long topic and to keep page load times down to a minimum the material was split into two sections....\u00a0...So, we are now going to solve quadratic equations.\u00a0 First, the ... of a quadratic equation is...\u00a0...The only requirement here is that we have an ...\u00a0in the equation.\u00a0 We guarantee that this term will be present in the equation by requiring ....\u00a0 Note however, that it is okay if ... and/or ... are zero....\u00a0...There are many ways to solve quadratic equations.\u00a0 We will look at four of them over the course of the next two sections.\u00a0 The first two methods won\u2019t always work, yet are probably a little simpler to use when they work.\u00a0 This section will cover these two methods.\u00a0 The last two methods will always work, but often require a little more work or attention to get correct.\u00a0 We will cover these methods in the next section....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started....\u00a0...As the heading suggests we will be solving quadratic equations here by factoring them.\u00a0 To do this we will need the following fact.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...\u00a0...This fact is called the ... or ....\u00a0 All the fact says is that if a product of two terms is zero then at least one of the terms had to be zero to start off with....\u00a0...Notice that this fact will ONLY work if the product is equal to zero.\u00a0 Consider the following product....In this case there is no reason to believe that either ... or ... will be 6.\u00a0 We could have ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0for instance.\u00a0 So, do not misuse this fact!...\u00a0...To solve a quadratic equation by factoring we first must move all the terms over to one side of the equation.\u00a0 Doing this serves two purposes.\u00a0 First, it puts the quadratics into a form that can be factored.\u00a0 Secondly, and probably more importantly, in order to use the zero factor property we MUST have a zero on one side of the equation.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t have a zero on one side of the equation we won\u2019t be able to use the zero factor property....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples.\u00a0 Note that it is assumed that you can do the factoring at this point and so we won\u2019t be giving any details on the factoring.\u00a0 If you need a review of factoring you should go back and take a look at the ... section of the previous chapter....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations by factoring....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, as noted earlier, we won\u2019t be putting any detail into   the factoring process, so make sure that you can do the factoring here....\u00a0... ...First, get everything on side of the equation and then   factor....Now at this point we\u2019ve got a product of two terms that is   equal to zero.\u00a0 This means that at   least one of the following must be true....\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that each of these is a linear equation that is easy   enough to solve.\u00a0 What this tell us is   that we have two solutions to the equation, ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 As with linear equations we can always   check our solutions by plugging the solution back into the equation.\u00a0 We will check ...\u00a0and leave the other to you to check....\u00a0...So, this was in fact a solution....\u00a0... ...As with the first one we first get everything on side of   the equal sign and then factor....Now, we once again have a product of two terms that equals   zero so we know that one or both of them have to be zero.\u00a0 So, technically we need to set each one   equal to zero and solve.\u00a0 However, this   is usually easy enough to do in our heads and so from now on we will be doing   this solving in our head....\u00a0...The solutions to this equation are,...To save space we won\u2019t be checking any more of the   solutions here, but you should do so to make sure we didn\u2019t make any   mistakes....\u00a0... ...In this case we already have zero on one side and so we   don\u2019t need to do any manipulation to the equation all that we need to do is   factor.\u00a0 Also, don\u2019t get excited about   the fact that we now have ...\u2019s in   the equation.\u00a0 We won\u2019t always be   dealing with ...\u2019s so don\u2019t expect to   always see them....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s factor this equation....\u00a0...In this case we\u2019ve got a perfect square.\u00a0 We broke up the square to denote that we   really do have an application of the zero factor property.\u00a0 However, we usually don\u2019t do that.\u00a0 We usually will go straight to the answer   from the squared part....\u00a0...The solution to the equation in this case is,...We only have a single value here as opposed to the two   solutions we\u2019ve been getting to this point.\u00a0   We will often call this solution a ... or say that it has ... because it came from a term that was squared....\u00a0... ...As always let\u2019s first factor the equation....Now apply the zero factor property.\u00a0 The zero factor property tells us that,...Again, we will typically solve these in our head, but we   needed to do at least one in complete detail.\u00a0   So we have two solutions to the equation....\u00a0... ...Now that we\u2019ve done quite a few of these, we won\u2019t be   putting in as much detail for the next two problems.\u00a0 Here is the work for this equation....\u00a0... ...Again, factor and use the zero factor property for this   one....\u00a0... ...This one always seems to cause trouble for students even   though it\u2019s really not too bad.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...First off.\u00a0 DO NOT   CANCEL AN ... FROM BOTH   SIDES!!!!\u00a0 Do you get the idea that   might be bad?\u00a0 It is.\u00a0 If you cancel an ... from both sides, you WILL miss a solution so don\u2019t do it.\u00a0 Remember we are solving by factoring here   so let\u2019s first get everything on one side of the equal sign....\u00a0...Now, notice that all we can do for factoring is to factor   an ... out of everything.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...From the first factor we get that ...\u00a0and from the second we get that ....\u00a0 These are the two solutions to this   equation.\u00a0 Note that is we\u2019d canceled   an ... in the first step we would NOT   have gotten ...\u00a0as an answer!...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another type of problem here.\u00a0 We saw some of these back in the ... section and since they can also occur with quadratic equations we should go ahead and work on to make sure that we can do them here as well....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Okay, just like with the linear equations the first thing   that we\u2019re going to need to do here is to clear the denominators out by   multiplying by the LCD.\u00a0 Recall that we   will also need to note value(s) of ...   that will give division by zero so that we can make sure that these aren\u2019t   included in the solution....\u00a0... ...The LCD for this problem is ...\u00a0and we will need to avoid ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0to make sure we don\u2019t get division by   zero.\u00a0 Here is the work for this   equation....So, it looks like the two solutions to this equation are,...Notice as well that neither of these are the values of ... that we needed to avoid and so both   are solutions....\u00a0... ...In this case the LCD is ...\u00a0and we will need to avoid ...\u00a0so we don\u2019t get division by zero.\u00a0 Here is the work for this problem....So, the quadratic that we factored and solved has two   solutions, ...\u00a0and ....\u00a0 However, when we found the LCD we also saw   that we needed to avoid ...\u00a0so we didn\u2019t get division by zero.\u00a0 Therefore, this equation has a single   solution,...\u00a0...Before proceeding to the next topic we should address that this idea of factoring can be used to solve equations with degree larger than two as well.\u00a0 Consider the following example....\u00a0...Solve   .......\u00a0...The first thing to do is factor this equation as much as   possible.\u00a0 In this case that means   factoring out the greatest common factor first.\u00a0 Here is the factored form of this equation....\u00a0...Now, the zero factor property will still hold here.\u00a0 In this case we have a product of three   terms that is zero.\u00a0 The only way this   product can be zero is if one of the terms is zero.\u00a0 This means that,...\u00a0...So, we have three solutions to this equation....\u00a0...So, provided we can factor a polynomial we can always use this as a solution technique.\u00a0 The problem is, of course, that it is sometimes not easy to do the factoring....\u00a0...The second method of solving quadratics we\u2019ll be looking at uses the ...,...\u00a0...There is a (potentially) new symbol here that we should define first in case you haven\u2019t seen it yet.\u00a0 The symbol \u201c...\u201d is read as : \u201cplus or minus\u201d and that is exactly what it tells us.\u00a0 This symbol is shorthand that tells us that we really have two numbers here.\u00a0 One is ...\u00a0and the other is ....\u00a0 Get used to this notation as it will be used frequently in the next couple of sections as we discuss the remaining solution techniques.\u00a0 It will also arise in other sections of this chapter and even in other chapters....\u00a0...This is a fairly simple property to use, however it can only be used on a small portion of the equations that we\u2019re ever likely to encounter.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see some examples of this property....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...   There really isn\u2019t all that much to these problems.\u00a0 In order to use the square root property   all that we need to do is get the squared quantity on the left side by itself   with a coefficient of 1 and the number on the other side.\u00a0 Once this is done we can use the square   root property.\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... ...This is a fairly simple problem so here is the work for   this equation....So, there are two solutions to this equation, ....\u00a0 Remember this means that there are really   two solutions here, ...\u00a0and .......\u00a0... ...Okay, the main difference between this one and the   previous one is the 25 in front of the squared term.\u00a0 The square root property wants a   coefficient of one there.\u00a0 That\u2019s easy   enough to deal with however; we\u2019ll just divide both sides by 25.\u00a0 Here is the work for this equation....In this case the solutions are a little messy, but many of   these will do so don\u2019t worry about that.\u00a0   Also note that since we knew what the square root of 25 was we went   ahead and split the square root of the fraction up as shown.\u00a0 Again, remember that there are really two   solutions here, one positive and one negative....\u00a0... ...This one is nearly identical to the previous part with one   difference that we\u2019ll see at the end of the example.\u00a0 Here is the work for this equation....\u00a0...So, there are two solutions to this equation : ....\u00a0 Notice as well that they are complex   solutions.\u00a0 This will happen with the   solution to many quadratic equations so make sure that you can deal with   them....\u00a0... ...This one looks different from the previous parts, however   it works the same way.\u00a0 The square root   property can be used anytime we have ...   squared equals a number.\u00a0 That is what   we have here.\u00a0 The main difference of   course is that the something that is squared isn\u2019t a single variable it is   something else.\u00a0 So, here is the   application of the square root property for this equation....\u00a0...Now, we just need to solve for ... and despite the \u201cplus or minus\u201d in the equation it works the same   way we would solve any linear equation.\u00a0   We will add 9 to both sides and then divide by a 2....\u00a0...Note that we multiplied the fraction through the   parenthesis for the final answer.\u00a0 We   will usually do this in these problems.\u00a0   Also, do NOT convert these to decimals unless you are asked to.\u00a0 This is the standard form for these   answers.\u00a0 With that being said we   should convert them to decimals just to make sure that you can.\u00a0 Here are the decimal values of the two   solutions....\u00a0... ...In this final part we\u2019ll not put much in the way of   details into the work....So we got two complex solutions again and notice as well   that with both of the previous part we put the \u201cplus or minus\u201d part   last.\u00a0 This is usually the way these   are written....\u00a0...As mentioned at the start of this section we are going to break this topic up into two sections for the benefit of those viewing this on the web.\u00a0 The next two methods of solving quadratic equations, completing the square and quadratic formula, are given in the next section.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolveQuadraticEqnsI.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Quadratic Equations - Part I", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We will start off this chapter with a fairly short section with some basic terminology that we use on a fairly regular basis in solving equations and inequalities....\u00a0...First, a ... to an equation or inequality is any number that, when plugged into the equation/inequality, will satisfy the equation/inequality.\u00a0 So, just what do we mean by satisfy?\u00a0 Let\u2019s work an example or two to illustrate this....\u00a0...Show   that each of the following numbers are solutions to the given equation or   inequality....\u00a0in ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0in ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0in ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0in ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... We first plug the proposed solution into the equation....So, what we are asking here is does the right side equal   the left side after we plug in the proposed solution.\u00a0 That is the meaning of the \u201c?\u201d above the   equal sign in the first line.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...Since the right side and the left side are the same we say   that ...\u00a0...   the equation....\u00a0... So, we want to see if ...\u00a0satisfies the equation.\u00a0 First plug the value into the equation....So, ...\u00a0satisfies the equation and so is a solution....\u00a0... In this case we\u2019ve got an inequality and in this case   \u201csatisfy\u201d means something slightly different.\u00a0   In this case we will say that a number will satisfy the inequality if,   after plugging it in, we get a true inequality as a result....\u00a0...Let\u2019s check .......\u00a0...So, -8 is less than or equal to 4 (in fact it\u2019s less than)   and so we have a true inequality.\u00a0   Therefore ...\u00a0will satisfy the inequality and hence is a   solution...\u00a0... This is the same inequality with a different value so let\u2019s   check that....In this case -20 is less than or equal to -20 (in this   case it\u2019s equal) and so again we get a true inequality and so ...\u00a0satisfies the inequality and so will be a   solution....\u00a0...We should also do a quick example of numbers that aren\u2019t solution so we can see how these will work as well....\u00a0...Show   that the following numbers aren\u2019t solutions to the given equation or   inequality....\u00a0in ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0in ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... In this case we do essentially the same thing that we did in   the previous example.\u00a0 Plug the number   in and show that this time it doesn\u2019t satisfy the equation.\u00a0 For equations that will mean that the right   side of the equation will not equal the left side of the equation....So, -3 is not the same as -13 and so the equation isn\u2019t   satisfied.\u00a0 Therefore ...\u00a0isn\u2019t a solution to the equation....\u00a0... This time we\u2019ve got an inequality.\u00a0 A number will not satisfy an inequality if   we get an inequality that isn\u2019t true after plugging the number in....In this case -34 is NOT less than or equal to -48 and so   the inequality isn\u2019t satisfied.\u00a0   Therefore ...\u00a0is not a solution to the inequality....\u00a0...Now, there is no reason to think that a given equation or inequality will only have a single solution.\u00a0 In fact, as the first example showed the inequality ...\u00a0has at least two solutions.\u00a0 Also, you might have noticed that ...\u00a0is not the only solution to\u00a0 ....\u00a0 In this case ...\u00a0is also a solution....\u00a0...We call the complete set of all solutions the ... for the equation or inequality.\u00a0 There is also some formal notation for solution sets although we won\u2019t be using it all that often in this course.\u00a0 Regardless of that fact we should still acknowledge it....\u00a0...For equations we denote the solution set by enclosing all the solutions is a set of braces, ....\u00a0 For the two equations we looked at above here are the solution sets....\u00a0...\u00a0...For inequalities we have a similar notation.\u00a0 Depending on the complexity of the inequality the solution set may be a single number or it may be a range of numbers.\u00a0 If it is a single number then we use the same notation as we used for equations.\u00a0 If the solution set is a range of numbers, as the one we looked at above is, we will use something called ...\u00a0 Here is the solution set for the inequality we looked at above....\u00a0...\u00a0...This is read as : \u201cThe set of all ... such that ... is greater than or equal to -5\u201d. ...\u00a0...Most of the inequalities that we will be looking at will have simple enough solution sets that we often just shorthand this as,...\u00a0...\u00a0...There is one final topic that we need to address as far as solution sets go before leaving this section.\u00a0 Consider the following equation and inequality....\u00a0...\u00a0...If we restrict ourselves to only real solutions (which we won\u2019t always do) then there is no solution to the equation.\u00a0 Squaring ... makes ... greater than equal to zero, then adding 1 onto that means that the left side is guaranteed to be at least 1.\u00a0 In other words, there is no real solution to this equation.\u00a0 For the same basic reason there is no solution to the inequality.\u00a0 Squaring any real ... makes it positive or zero and so will never be negative....\u00a0...We need a way to denote the fact that there are no solutions here.\u00a0 In solution set notation we say that the solution set is ... and denote it with the symbol : ....\u00a0 This symbol is often called the .... ...\u00a0...We now need to make a couple of final comments before leaving this section.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...In the above discussion of empty sets we assumed that were only looking for real solutions.\u00a0 While that is what we will be doing for inequalities, we won\u2019t be restricting ourselves to real solutions with equations.\u00a0 Once we get around to solving quadratic equations (which ...\u00a0is) we will allow solutions to be complex numbers and in the case looked at above there are complex solutions to ....\u00a0 If you don\u2019t know how to find these at this point that is fine we will be covering that material in a couple of sections.\u00a0 At this point just accept that ...\u00a0does have complex solutions....\u00a0...Finally, as noted above we won\u2019t be using the solution set notation much in this course.\u00a0 It is a nice notation and does have some use on occasion especially for complicated solutions.\u00a0 However, for the vast majority of the equations and inequalities that we will be looking at will have simple enough solution sets that it\u2019s just easier to write down the solutions and let it go at that.\u00a0 Therefore, that is what we will not be using the notation for our solution sets.\u00a0 However, you should be aware of the notation and know what it means.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/SolutionSets.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Solutions and Solution Sets", "subject": "math"}},
{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "We now need to discuss the section that most students hate.\u00a0 We need to talk about applications to linear equations.\u00a0 Or, put in other words, we will now start looking at story problems or word problems.\u00a0 Throughout history students have hated these.\u00a0 It is my belief however that the main reason for this is that students really don\u2019t know how to work them.\u00a0 Once you understand how to work them, you\u2019ll probably find that they aren\u2019t as bad as they may seem on occasion.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll start this section off with a process for working applications....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start things off with a couple of fairly basic examples to illustrate the process.\u00a0 Note as well that at this point it is assumed that you are capable of solving fairly simple linear equations and so not a lot of detail will be given for the actual solution stage.\u00a0 The point of this section is more on the set up of the equation than the solving of the equation....\u00a0...\u00a0...In   a certain Algebra class there is a total of 350 possible points.\u00a0 These points come from 5 homework sets that   are worth 10 points each and 3 hour exams that are worth 100 points   each.\u00a0 A student has received homework   scores of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 and the first two exam scores are 78 and 83.\u00a0 Assuming that grades are assigned according   to the standard scale and there are no weights assigned to any of the grades   is it possible for the student to receive an A in the class and if so what is   the minimum score on the third exam that will give an A?\u00a0 What about a B?...\u00a0...Okay, let\u2019s start off by defining ... to be the minimum required score on the third exam....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s recall how grades are set.\u00a0 Since there are no weights or anything on   the grades, the grade will be set by first computing the following   percentage....\u00a0...\u00a0...Since we are using the standard scale if the grade   percentage is 0.9 or higher the student will get an A.\u00a0 Likewise if the grade percentage is between   0.8 and 0.9 the student will get a B....\u00a0...We know that the total possible points is 350 and the   student has a total points (including the third exam) of,...\u00a0...The smallest possible percentage for an A is 0.9 and so   if\u00a0 ...   is the minimum required score on the third exam for an A we will have the   following equation....\u00a0...This is a linear equation that we will need to solve for .......\u00a0...So, the minimum required score on the third exam is   119.\u00a0 This is a problem since the exam   is worth only 100 points.\u00a0 In other   words, the student will not be getting an A in the Algebra class....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s check if the student will get a B.\u00a0 In this case the minimum percentage is   0.8.\u00a0 So, to find the minimum required   score on the third exam for a B we will need to solve,...\u00a0...Solving this for ...   gives,...\u00a0...So, it is possible for the student to get a B in the   class.\u00a0 All that the student will need   to do is get at least an 84 on the third exam....\u00a0...We   want to build a set of shelves.\u00a0 The   width of the set of shelves needs to be 4 times the height of the set of   shelves and the set of shelves must have three shelves in it.\u00a0 If there are 72 feet of wood to use to   build the set of shelves what should the dimensions of the set of shelves be?...\u00a0...We will first define ...   to be the height of the set of shelves.\u00a0   This means that 4... is width   of the set of shelves.\u00a0 In this case we   definitely need to sketch a figure so we can correctly set up the   equation.\u00a0 Here it is,...Now we know that there are 72 feet of wood to be used and   we will assume that all of it will be used.\u00a0   So, we can set up the following word equation....\u00a0...It is often a good idea to first put the equation in words   before actually writing down the equation as we did here.\u00a0 At this point, we can see from the figure   there are two vertical pieces; each one has a length of ....\u00a0 Also, there are 4   horizontal pieces, each with a length of 4....   So, the equation is then,...So, it looks like the height of the set of shelves should   be 4 feet.\u00a0 Note however that we   haven\u2019t actually answered the question however.\u00a0 The problem asked us to find the dimensions.\u00a0 This means that we also need the width of   the set of shelves.\u00a0 The width is   4(4)=16 feet.\u00a0 So the dimensions will   need to be 4x16 feet....\u00a0...The next couple of problems deal with some basic principles of pricing....\u00a0...A   calculator has been marked up 15% and is being sold for $78.50.\u00a0 How much did the store pay the manufacturer   of the calculator?...\u00a0...First, let\u2019s define ...   to be the cost that the store paid for the calculator.\u00a0 The stores markup on the calculator is   15%.\u00a0 This means that 0.15... has been added on to the original   price (...) to get the amount the   calculator is being sold for.\u00a0 In other   words, we have the following equation...that we need to solve for ....\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...The store paid $68.26 for the calculator.\u00a0 Note that since we are dealing with money   we rounded the answer down to two decimal places....\u00a0...A   shirt is on sale for $15.00 and has been marked down 35%.\u00a0 How much was the shirt being sold for   before the sale?...\u00a0...This problem is pretty much the opposite of the previous   example.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with defining ... to be the price of the shirt before   the sale.\u00a0 It has been marked down by   35%.\u00a0 This means that 0.35... has been subtracted off from the   original price.\u00a0 Therefore, the   equation (and solution) is,...\u00a0...So, with rounding it looks like the shirt was originally   sold for $23.08....\u00a0...These are some of the standard problems that most people think about when they think about Algebra word problems.\u00a0 The standard formula that we will be using here is...\u00a0...\u00a0...All of the problems that we\u2019ll be doing in this set of examples will use this to one degree or another and often more than once as we will see....\u00a0...Two   cars are 500 miles apart and moving directly towards each other.\u00a0 One car is moving at a speed of 100 mph and   the other is moving at 70 mph.\u00a0   Assuming that the cars start moving at the same time how long does it   take for the two cars to meet?...\u00a0...Let\u2019s let ...   represent the amount of time that the cars are traveling before they   meet.\u00a0 Now, we need to sketch a figure   for this one.\u00a0 This figure will help us   to write down the equation that we\u2019ll need to solve....From this figure we can see that the Distance Car A   travels plus the Distance Car B travels must equal the total distance   separating the two cars, 500 miles....\u00a0...Here is the word equation for this problem in two separate   forms....\u00a0...\u00a0...We used the standard formula here twice, once for each   car.\u00a0 We know that the distance a car   travels is the rate of the car times the time traveled by the car.\u00a0 In this case we know that Car A travels at   100 mph for ... hours and that Car B   travels at 70 mph for ... hours as   well.\u00a0 Plugging these into the word   equation and solving gives us,...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, they will travel for approximately 2.94 hours before   meeting....\u00a0...Repeat   the previous example except this time assume that the faster car will start 1   hour after slower car starts....\u00a0...For this problem we are going to need to be careful with   the time traveled by each car.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   let ... be the amount of time that   the slower travel car travels.\u00a0 Now,   since the faster car starts out 1 hour after the slower car it will only   travel for ...\u00a0hours....\u00a0...Now, since we are repeating the problem from above the   figure and word equation will remain identical and so we won\u2019t bother   repeating them here.\u00a0 The only   difference is what we substitute for the time traveled for the faster   car.\u00a0 Instead of ... as we used in the previous example we will use ...\u00a0since it travels for one hour less that the   slower car....\u00a0...Here is the equation and solution for this example....\u00a0...In this case the slower car will travel for 3.53 hours before   meeting while the faster car will travel for 2.53 hrs (1 hour less than the   faster car\u2026)....\u00a0...Two   boats start out 100 miles apart and start moving to the right at the same   time.\u00a0 The boat on the left is moving   at twice the speed as the boat on the right.\u00a0   Five hours after starting the boat on the left catches up with the   boat on the right.\u00a0 How fast was each   boat moving?...\u00a0...Let\u2019s start off by letting ... be the speed of the boat on the right (the slower boat).\u00a0 This means that the boat to the left (the   faster boat) is moving at a speed of 2....\u00a0 Here is the figure for this situation....From the figure it looks like we\u2019ve got the following word   equation....Upon plugging in the standard formula for the distance   gives,...\u00a0...For this problem we know that the time each is 5 hours and   we know that the rate of Boat A is 2...   and the rate of Boat B is ....\u00a0 Plugging these into the work equation and   solving gives,...\u00a0...So, the slower boat is moving at 20 mph and the faster   boat is moving at 40 mph (twice as fast)....\u00a0...These problems are actually variants of the Distance/Rate problems that we just got done working.\u00a0 The standard equation that will be needed for these problems is,...As you can see this formula is very similar to the formula we used above....\u00a0...An   office has two envelope stuffing machines.\u00a0   Machine A can stuff a batch of envelopes in 5 hours, while Machine B   can stuff a batch of envelopes in 3 hours.\u00a0   How long would it take the two machines working together to stuff a   batch of envelopes?...\u00a0...Let ... be the   time that it takes both machines, working together, to stuff a batch of   envelopes.\u00a0 The word equation for this   problem is,...\u00a0...We know that the time spent working is ... however we don\u2019t know the work rate   of each machine.\u00a0 To get these we\u2019ll   need to use the initial information given about how long it takes each   machine to do the job individually.\u00a0 We   can use the following equation to get these rates....Let\u2019s start with Machine A....Now, Machine B....\u00a0...Plugging these quantities into the main equation above   gives the following equation that we need to solve....So, it looks like it will take the two machines, working   together, 1.875 hours to stuff a batch of envelopes....\u00a0...Mary   can clean an office complex in 5 hours.\u00a0   Working together John and Mary can clean the office complex in 3.5   hours.\u00a0 How long would it take John to   clean the office complex by himself?...\u00a0...Let ... be the   amount of time it would take John to clean the office complex by   himself.\u00a0 The basic word equation for   this problem is,...\u00a0...This time we know that the time spent working together is   3.5 hours.\u00a0 We now need to find the   work rates for each person.\u00a0 We\u2019ll   start with Mary....Now we\u2019ll find the work rate of John.\u00a0 Notice however, that since we don\u2019t know   how long it will take him to do the job by himself we aren\u2019t going to be able   to get a single number for this.\u00a0 That   is not a problem as we\u2019ll see in a second....Notice that we\u2019ve managed to get the work rate of John in   terms of the time it would take him to do the job himself.\u00a0 This means that once we solve the equation   above we\u2019ll have the answer that we want.\u00a0   So, let\u2019s plug into the work equation and solve for the time it would   take John to do the job by himself....\u00a0...So, it looks like it would take John 11.67 hours to clean   the complex by himself....\u00a0...This is the final type of problems that we\u2019ll be looking at in this section.\u00a0 We are going to be looking at mixing solutions of different percentages to get a new percentage.\u00a0 The solution will consist of a secondary liquid mixed in with water.\u00a0 The secondary liquid can be alcohol or acid for instance....\u00a0...The standard equation that we\u2019ll use here will be the following....Note as well that the percentage needs to be a decimal.\u00a0 So if we have an 80% solution we will need to use 0.80....\u00a0...How   much of a 50% alcohol solution should we mix with 10 gallons of a 35%   solution to get a 40% solution?...\u00a0...Okay, let ... be   the amount of 50% solution that we need.\u00a0   This means that there will be ...\u00a0gallons of the 40% solution once we\u2019re done   mixing the two....\u00a0...Here is the basic work equation for this problem....\u00a0...Now, plug in the volumes and solve for .......\u00a0...So, we need 5 gallons of the 50% solution to get a 40%   solution....\u00a0...We   have a 40% acid solution and we want 75 liters of a 15% acid solution.\u00a0 How much water should we put into the 40%   solution to do this? ...\u00a0...Let ... be the   amount of water we need to add to the 40% solution.\u00a0 Now, we also don\u2019t how much of the 40% solution   we\u2019ll need.\u00a0 However, since we know the   final volume (75 liters) we will know that we will need ...\u00a0liters of the 40% solution....\u00a0...Here is the word equation for this problem....\u00a0...\u00a0...Notice that in the first term we used the \u201cAmount of acid   in the water\u201d.\u00a0 This might look a   little weird to you because there shouldn\u2019t be any acid in the water.\u00a0 However, this is exactly what we want.\u00a0 The basic equation tells us to look at how   much of the secondary liquid is in the water.\u00a0   So, this is the correct wording.\u00a0   When we plug in the percentages and volumes we will think of the water   as a 0% percent solution since that is in fact what it is.\u00a0 So, the new word equation is,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Do not get excited about the zero in the first term.\u00a0 This is okay and will not be a   problem.\u00a0 Let\u2019s now plug in the volumes   and solve for .......So, we need to add in 46.875 liters of water to 28.125   liters of a 40% solution to get 75 liters of a 15% solution.", "url":

summarize the process and then we will work some examples....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following

explanation out of the following problems....\u00a0... ...For this problem there are no fractions so we don\u2019t need   to worry about the first step in the process.\u00a0   The next step tells to simplify both sides.\u00a0 So, we will clear out any parenthesis by   multiplying the numbers through and then combine like terms....\u00a0...The next step is to get all the ...\u2019s on one side and all the numbers on the other side.\u00a0 Which side the ...\u2019s go on is up to you and will probably vary with the   problem.\u00a0 As a rule of thumb we will   usually put the variables on the side that will give a positive   coefficient.\u00a0 This is done simply   because it is often easy to lose track of the minus sign on the coefficient   and so if we make sure it is positive we won\u2019t need to worry about it....\u00a0...So, for our case this will mean adding 4... to both sides and subtracting 15   from both sides.\u00a0 Note as well that   while we will actually put those operations in this time we normally do these   operations in our head....\u00a0...\u00a0...The next step says to get a coefficient of 1 in front of   the ....\u00a0 In this case we can do this by

the   solution.\u00a0 As pointed out in the   process outline we need to check the solution in the ... equation.\u00a0 This is   important, because we may have made a mistake in the very first step and if   we did and then checked the answer in the results from that step it may seem to   indicate that the solution is correct when the reality will be that we don\u2019t   have the correct answer because of the mistake that we originally made. ...\u00a0...The problem of course is that, with this solution, that   checking might be a little messy.\u00a0   Let\u2019s do it anyway....\u00a0...So, we did our work correctly and the solution to the   equation is,...\u00a0...Note that we didn\u2019t use the solution set notation   here.\u00a0 For single solutions we will   rarely do that in this class.\u00a0 However,   if we had wanted to the solution set notation for this problem would be,...\u00a0...Before proceeding to the next problem let\u2019s first make a   quick comment about the \u201cmessiness\u2019 of this answer.\u00a0 Do NOT expect all answers to be nice simple   integers.\u00a0 While we do try to keep most   answer simple often they won\u2019t be so do NOT get so locked into the idea that   an answer must be a simple integer that you immediately assume that you\u2019ve   made a mistake because of the \u201cmessiness\u201d of the answer....\u00a0... ...Okay, with this one we won\u2019t be putting quite as much   explanation into the problem....\u00a0...In this case we have fractions so to make our life easier   we will multiply both sides by the LCD, which is 21 in this case.\u00a0 After doing that the problem will be very   similar to the previous problem.\u00a0 Note   as well that the denominators are only numbers and so we won\u2019t need to worry   about division by zero issues....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first multiply both sides by the LCD....Be careful to correctly distribute the 21 through the   parenthesis on the left side.\u00a0   Everything inside the parenthesis needs to be multiplied by the 21   before we simplify.\u00a0 At this point   we\u2019ve got a problem that is similar the previous problem and we won\u2019t bother   with all the explanation this time....\u00a0...So, it looks like ...\u00a0is the solution.\u00a0 Let\u2019s verify it to make sure....So, it is the solution....\u00a0... ...This one is similar to the previous one except now we\u2019ve   got variables in the denominator.\u00a0 So,   to get the LCD we\u2019ll first need to completely factor the denominators of each   rational expression....So, it looks like the LCD is ....\u00a0 Also note that we will need to avoid ...\u00a0since if we plugged that into the equation   we would get division by zero....\u00a0...Now, outside of the ...\u2019s   in the denominator this problem works identical to the previous one so let\u2019s   do the work....\u00a0...Now the solution is not ...\u00a0so we won\u2019t get division by zero with the   solution which is a good thing.\u00a0   Finally, let\u2019s do a quick verification....\u00a0...So we did the work correctly....\u00a0... ...In this case it looks like the LCD is ...\u00a0and it also looks like we will need to avoid   ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0to make sure that we don\u2019t get division by   zero....\u00a0...Let\u2019s get started on the work for this problem....\u00a0...At this point let\u2019s pause and acknowledge that we\u2019ve got a   ... in the work   here.\u00a0 Do not get excited about   that.\u00a0 Sometimes these will show up   temporarily in these problems.\u00a0 You   should only worry about it if it is still there after we finish the   simplification work....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s finish the problem....\u00a0...Notice that the ...   did in fact cancel out.\u00a0 Now, if we did   our work correctly ...\u00a0should be the solution since it is not   either of the two values that will give division by zero.\u00a0 Let\u2019s verify this....\u00a0...The checking can be a little messy at times, but it does   mean that we KNOW the solution is correct....\u00a0...Okay, in the last couple of parts of the previous example we kept going on about watching out for division by zero problems and yet we never did get a solution where that was an issue.\u00a0 So, we should now do a couple of those problems to see how they work....\u00a0...Solve   each of the following equations....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0... ...The first step is to factor the denominators to get the   LCD....So, the LCD is ...\u00a0and we will need to avoid ...\u00a0and ...\u00a0so we don\u2019t get division by zero....\u00a0...Here is the work for this problem....\u00a0...So, we get a \u201csolution\u201d that is in the list of numbers   that we need to avoid so we don\u2019t get division by zero and so we can\u2019t use it   as a solution.\u00a0 However, this is also   the only possible solution.\u00a0 That is   okay.\u00a0 This just means that this   equation has .......\u00a0... ...The LCD for this equation is ...\u00a0and we will need to avoid ...\u00a0so we don\u2019t get division by zero.\u00a0 Here is the work for this equation....\u00a0...So, we once again arrive at the single value of ... that we needed to avoid so we didn\u2019t   get division by zero.\u00a0 Therefore, this   equation has .......\u00a0...So, as we\u2019ve seen we do need to be careful with division by zero issues when we start off with equations that contain rational expressions....\u00a0...At this point we should probably also acknowledge that provided we don\u2019t have any division by zero issues (such as those in the last set of examples) linear equations will have exactly one solution.\u00a0 We will never get more than one solution and the only time that we won\u2019t get any solutions is if we run across a division by zero problems with the \u201csolution\u201d....\u00a0...Before leaving this section we should note that many of the techniques for solving linear equations will show up time and again as we cover different kinds of equations so it very important that you understand this process.", "url":

So all that we need to do is distribute the 7... through the parenthesis....Now, this is where the small difference mentioned earlier   comes into play.\u00a0 This number is NOT in   standard form.\u00a0 The standard form for   complex numbers does not have an ...   in it.\u00a0 This however is not a problem   provided we recall that ...\u00a0...Using this we get,...We also rearranged the order so that the real part is   listed first....\u00a0... In this case we will FOIL the two numbers and we\u2019ll need to   also remember to get rid of the ....... Same thing with this one....\u00a0... Here\u2019s one final multiplication that will lead us into the   next topic....Don\u2019t get excited about it when the product of two complex   numbers is a real number.\u00a0 That can and   will happen on occasion....\u00a0...In the final part of the previous example we multiplied a number by its conjugate.\u00a0 There is a nice general formula for this that will be convenient when it comes to discussing division of complex numbers....\u00a0...So, when we multiply a complex number by its conjugate we get a real number given by,...\u00a0...Now, we gave this formula with the comment that it will be convenient when it came to dividing complex numbers so let\u2019s look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Write   each of the following in standard form....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...So, in each case we are really looking at the division of   two complex numbers.\u00a0 The main idea   here however is that we want to write them in standard form.\u00a0 Standard form does not allow for any ...'s to be in the denominator.\u00a0 So, we need to get the ...'s out of the denominator.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...This is actually fairly simple if we recall that a complex   number times its conjugate is a real number.\u00a0   So, if we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of   the denominator we will be able to eliminate the ... from the denominator....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve figured out how to do these let\u2019s go ahead   and work the problems....\u00a0... ...\u00a0...Notice that to officially put the answer in standard form   we broke up the fraction into the real and imaginary parts.... ...\u00a0... ...\u00a0... This one is a little different from the previous ones since   the denominator is a pure imaginary number.\u00a0   It can be done in the same manner as the previous ones, but there is a   slightly easier way to do the problem.\u00a0   ...\u00a0...First, break up the fraction as follows....Now, we want the ...   out of the denominator and since there is only an ... in the denominator of the first term we will simply multiply   the numerator and denominator of the first term by an .......\u00a0...The next topic that we want to discuss here is powers of ....\u00a0 Let\u2019s just take a look at what happens when we start looking at various powers of .......\u00a0...Can you see the pattern?\u00a0 All powers if ... can be reduced down to one of four possible answers and they repeat every four powers.\u00a0 This can be a convenient fact to remember....\u00a0...We next need to address an issue on dealing with square roots of negative numbers.\u00a0 From the section on radicals we know that we can do the following....In other words, we can break up products under a square root into a product of square roots provided both numbers are positive....\u00a0...It turns out that we can actually do the same thing if ... of the numbers is negative.\u00a0 For instance,...\u00a0...However, if BOTH numbers are negative this won\u2019t work anymore as the following shows....\u00a0...We can summarize this up as a set of rules.\u00a0 If ... and ... are both positive numbers then,...\u00a0...Why is this important enough to worry about?\u00a0 Consider the following example....\u00a0...Multiply   the following and write the answer in standard form....If we where to multiply this out in its present form we   would get,...Now, if we were not being careful we would probably   combine the two roots in the final term into one which can\u2019t be done!...\u00a0...So, there is a general rule of thumb in dealing with   square roots of negative numbers.\u00a0 When   faced with them the first thing that you should always do is convert them to   complex number.\u00a0 If we follow this rule   we will always get the correct answer....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s work this problem the way it should be worked....\u00a0...The rule of thumb given in the previous example is important enough to make again.\u00a0 When faced with square roots of negative numbers the first thing that you should do is convert them to complex numbers....\u00a0...There is one final topic that we need to touch on before leaving this section.\u00a0 As we noted back in the section on radicals even though ...\u00a0there are in fact two numbers that we can square to get 9.\u00a0 We can square both 3 and -3....\u00a0...The same will hold for square roots of negative numbers.\u00a0 As we saw earlier ....\u00a0 As with square roots of positive numbers in this case we are really asking what did we square to get -9?\u00a0 Well it\u2019s easy enough to check that 3... is correct....However, that is not the only possibility.\u00a0 Consider the following,...and so if we square -3... we will also get -9.\u00a0 So, when taking the square root of a negative number there are really two numbers that we can square to get the number under the radical.\u00a0 However, we will ALWAYS take the positive number for the value of the square root just as we do with the square root of positive numbers.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/ComplexNumbers.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Complex Numbers", "subject": "math"}},

A rational expression has been ... if all common factors from the numerator and denominator have been canceled.\u00a0 We already know how to do this with number fractions so let\u2019s take a quick look at an example....\u00a0...\u00a0...With rational expression it works exactly the same way....\u00a0...\u00a0...We do have to be careful with canceling however.\u00a0 There are some common mistakes that students often make with these problems.\u00a0 Recall that in order to cancel a factor it must multiply the whole numerator and the whole denominator.\u00a0 So, the ...3 above could cancel since it multiplied the whole numerator and the whole denominator.\u00a0 However, the ...\u2019s in the reduced form can\u2019t cancel since the ... in the numerator is not times the whole numerator. ...\u00a0...To see why the ...\u2019s don\u2019t cancel in the reduced form above put a number in and see what happens.\u00a0 Let\u2019s plug in ...=4....Clearly the two aren\u2019t the same number!\u00a0 ...\u00a0...So, be careful with canceling.\u00a0 As a general rule of thumb remember that you can\u2019t cancel something if it\u2019s got a \u201c+\u201d or a \u201c-\u201d on one side of it.\u00a0 There is one exception to this rule of thumb with \u201c-\u201d that we\u2019ll deal with in an example later on down the road....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Reduce   the following rational expression to lowest terms....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...When reducing a rational expression to lowest terms the   first thing that we will do is factor both the numerator and denominator as   much as possible.\u00a0 That should always   be the first step in these problems....\u00a0...Also, the factoring in this section, and all successive   section for that matter, will be done without explanation.\u00a0 It will be assumed that you are capable of   doing and/or checking the factoring on your own.\u00a0 In other words, make sure that you can   factor!...\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll first factor things out as completely as   possible.\u00a0 Remember that we can\u2019t   cancel anything at this point in time since every term has a \u201c+\u201d or a \u201c-\u201d on   one side of it!\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to factor   first!...\u00a0...\u00a0...At this point we can see that we\u2019ve got a common factor in   both the numerator and the denominator and so we can cancel the ...-4 from both.\u00a0 Doing this gives,...\u00a0...\u00a0...This is also all the farther that we can go.\u00a0 Nothing else will cancel and so we have   reduced this expression to lowest terms....\u00a0... ...Again, the first thing that we\u2019ll do here is factor the   numerator and denominator....At first glance it looks there is nothing that will   cancel.\u00a0 Notice however that there is a   term in the denominator that is almost the same as a term in the numerator   except all the signs are the opposite....\u00a0...We can use the following fact on the second term in the   denominator....This is commonly referred to as ... because that is exactly what we\u2019ve   done.\u00a0 There are two forms here that   cover both possibilities that we are liable to run into.\u00a0 In our case however we need the first form....\u00a0...Because of some notation issues let\u2019s just work with the   denominator for a while....Notice the steps used here.\u00a0 In the first step we factored out the minus   sign, but we are still multiplying the terms and so we put in an added set of   brackets to make sure that we didn\u2019t forget that.\u00a0 In the second step we acknowledged that a   minus sign in front is the same as multiplication by \u201c-1\u201d.\u00a0 Once we did that we didn\u2019t really need the   extra set of brackets anymore so we dropped them in the third step.\u00a0 Next, we recalled that we change the order   of a multiplication if we need to so we flipped the ... and the \u201c-1\u201d.\u00a0 Finally,   we dropped the \u201c-1\u201d and just went back to a negative sign in the front....\u00a0...Typically when we factor out minus signs we skip all the   intermediate steps and go straight to the final step....\u00a0...Let\u2019s now get back to the problem.\u00a0 The rational expression becomes,...At this point we can see that we do have a common factor   and so we can cancel the .......\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...In this case the denominator is already factored for us to   make our life easier.\u00a0 All we need to   do is factor the numerator....Now we reach the point of this part of the example.\u00a0 There are 5 ...\u2019s in the numerator and 3 in the denominator so when we cancel   there will be 2 left in the numerator.\u00a0   Likewise, there are 2 ...\u2019s in the numerator and 8 in the   denominator so when we cancel there will be 6 left in the denominator.\u00a0 Here is the rational expression reduced to   lowest terms....\u00a0...Before moving on let\u2019s briefly discuss the answer in the second part of this example.\u00a0 Notice that we moved the minus sign from the denominator to the front of the rational expression in the final form.\u00a0 This can always be done when we need to.\u00a0 Recall that the following are all equivalent....In other words, a minus sign in front of a rational expression can be moved onto the whole numerator or whole denominator if it is convenient to do that.\u00a0 We do have to be careful with this however.\u00a0 Consider the following rational expression....\u00a0...In this case the \u201c-\u201d on the ... can\u2019t be moved to the front of the rational expression since it is only on the ....\u00a0 In order to move a minus sign to the front of a rational expression it needs to be times the whole numerator or denominator.\u00a0 So, if we factor a minus out of the numerator we could then move it into the front of the rational expression as follows,...\u00a0...The moral here is that we need to be careful with moving minus signs around in rational expressions....\u00a0...We now need to move into adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing rational expressions....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start with multiplying and dividing rational expressions.\u00a0 The general formulas are as follows,...\u00a0...Note the two different forms for denoting division. \u00a0We will use either as needed so make sure you are familiar with both.\u00a0 Note as well that to do division of rational expressions all that we need to do is multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator (... the fraction with the numerator and denominator switched)....\u00a0...Before doing a couple of examples there are a couple of ... cases of division that we should look at.\u00a0 In the general case above both the numerator and the denominator of the rational expression where fractions, however, what if one of them isn\u2019t a fraction.\u00a0 So let\u2019s look at the following cases....\u00a0...Students often make mistakes with these initially.\u00a0 To correctly deal with these we will turn the numerator (first case) or denominator (second case) into a fraction and then do the general division on them....\u00a0...Be careful with these cases.\u00a0 It is easy to make a mistake with these and incorrectly do the division....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Perform   the indicated operation and reduce the answer to lowest terms....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Notice that with this problem we have started to move away   from ... as the main variable in the   examples.\u00a0 Do not get so used to seeing   ...\u2019s that you always expect   them.\u00a0 The problems will work the same   way regardless of the letter we use for the variable so don\u2019t get excited   about the different letters here....\u00a0... ...Okay, this is a multiplication.\u00a0 The first thing that we should always do in   the multiplication is to factor everything in sight as much as possible....\u00a0...Now, recall that we can cancel things across a   multiplication as follows....Note that this ONLY works for multiplication and NOT for   division!...\u00a0...In this case we do have multiplication so cancel as much   as we can and then do the multiplication to get the answer....\u00a0... ...With division problems it is very easy to mistakenly   cancel something that shouldn\u2019t be canceled and so the first thing we do here   (before factoring!!!!) is do the division.\u00a0   Once we\u2019ve done the division we have a multiplication problem and we   factor as much as possible, cancel everything that can be canceled and   finally do the multiplication....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s get started on this problem....\u00a0...Now, notice that there will be a lot of canceling   here.\u00a0 Also notice that if we factor a   minus sign out of the denominator of the second rational expression.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do some of the canceling and then do   the multiplication....\u00a0...Remember that when we cancel all the terms out of a   numerator or denominator there is actually a \u201c1\u201d left over!\u00a0 Now, we didn\u2019t finish the canceling to make   a point.\u00a0 Recall that at the start of   this discussion we said that as a rule of thumb we can only cancel terms if   there isn\u2019t a \u201c+\u201d or a \u201c-\u201d on either side of it with one exception for the   \u201c-\u201d.\u00a0 We are now at that   exception.\u00a0 If there is a \u201c-\u201d if front   of the whole numerator or denominator, as we\u2019ve got here, then we can still   cancel the term.\u00a0 In this case the \u201c-\u201d   acts as a \u201c-1\u201d that is multiplied by the whole denominator and so is a factor   instead of an addition or subtraction.\u00a0   Here is the final answer for this part....\u00a0...\u00a0...In this case all the terms canceled out and we were left   with a number.\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t happen all   that often, but as this example has shown it clearly can happen every once in   a while so don\u2019t get excited about it when it does happen....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...This is one of the special cases for division.\u00a0 So, as with the previous part, we will   first do the division and then we will factor and cancel as much as we can....\u00a0...Here is the work for this part....\u00a0...Okay, it\u2019s time to move on to addition and subtraction of rational expressions.\u00a0 Here are the general formulas....\u00a0...As these have shown we\u2019ve got to remember that in order to add or subtract rational expression or fractions we MUST have common denominators.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t have common denominators then we need to first get common denominators....\u00a0...Let\u2019s remember how do to do this with a quick number example....In this case we need a common denominator and recall that it\u2019s usually best to use the ..., often denoted ....\u00a0 In this case the least common denominator is 12.\u00a0 So we need to get the denominators of these two fractions to a 12.\u00a0 This is easy to do.\u00a0 In the first case we need to multiply the denominator by 2 to get 12 so we will multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 2.\u00a0 Remember that we\u2019ve got to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number since we aren\u2019t allowed to actually change the problem and this is equivalent to multiplying the fraction by 1 since ....\u00a0 For the second term we\u2019ll need to multiply the numerator and denominator by a 3....\u00a0...\u00a0...Now, the process for rational expressions is identical.\u00a0 The main difficulty is in finding the least common denominator.\u00a0 However, there is a really simple process for finding the least common denominator for rational expressions.\u00a0 Here is it....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some examples....\u00a0...Perform   the indicated operation....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...For this problem there are coefficients on each term in   the denominator so we\u2019ll first need the least common denominator for the   coefficients.\u00a0 This is 6.\u00a0 Now, ...   (by itself with a power of 1) is the only factor that occurs in any of the   denominators.\u00a0 So, the least common   denominator for this part is ... with   the largest power that occurs on all the ...\u2019s   in the problem, which is 5.\u00a0 So, the   least common denominator for this set of rational expression is...\u00a0...\u00a0...So, we simply need to multiply each term by an appropriate   quantity to get this in the denominator and then do the addition and   subtraction.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do that....\u00a0... ...In this case there are only two factors and they both   occur to the first power and so the least common denominator is....\u00a0...Now, in determining what to multiply each part by simply   compare the current denominator to the least common denominator and multiply   top and bottom by whatever is \u201cmissing\u201d.\u00a0   In the first term we\u2019re \u201cmissing\u201d a ...\u00a0and so that\u2019s what we multiply the numerator   and denominator by.\u00a0 In the second term   we\u2019re \u201cmissing\u201d a ...\u00a0and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll multiply in that   term....\u00a0...Here is the work for this problem....\u00a0...The final step is to do any multiplication in the   numerator and simplify that up as much as possible....\u00a0...Be careful with minus signs and parenthesis when doing the   subtraction....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s first factor the denominators and determine the   least common denominator....So, there are two factors in the denominators a ... and a ....\u00a0 So we will write both   of those down and then take the highest power for each.\u00a0 That means a 2 for the ... and a 1 for the ....\u00a0 Here is the least common denominator for   this rational expression....\u00a0...Now determine what\u2019s missing in the denominator for each   term, multiply the numerator and denominator by that and then finally do the   subtraction and addition....\u00a0...Okay now let\u2019s multiply the numerator out and   simplify.\u00a0 In the last term recall that   we need to do the multiplication prior to distributing the 3 through the   parenthesis.\u00a0 Here is the   simplification work for this part....\u00a0... ...Again, factor the denominators and get the least common   denominator....The least common denominator is,...\u00a0...Notice that the first rational expression already contains   this in its denominator, but that is okay.\u00a0   In fact, because of that the work will be slightly easier in this   case.\u00a0 Here is the subtraction for this   problem....\u00a0...Notice that we can actually go one step further here. \u00a0If we factor a minus out of the numerator we   can do some canceling....Sometimes this kind of canceling will happen after the   addition/subtraction so be on the lookout for it....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...The point of this problem is that \u201c1\u201d sitting out behind   everything.\u00a0 That isn\u2019t really the   problem that it appears to be.\u00a0 Let\u2019s   first rewrite things a little here....\u00a0...In this way we see that we really have three fractions   here.\u00a0 One of them simply has a   denominator of one.\u00a0 The least common   denominator for this part is,...\u00a0...Here is the addition and subtraction for this problem....\u00a0...Notice the set of parenthesis we added onto the second   numerator as we did the subtraction.\u00a0   We are subtracting off the whole numerator and so we need the   parenthesis there to make sure we don\u2019t make any mistakes with the subtraction....\u00a0...Here is the simplification for this rational expression.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/RationalExpressions.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Rational Expressions", "subject": "math"}},

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "In this section we will start looking at polynomials.\u00a0 Polynomials will show up in pretty much every section of every chapter in the remainder of this material and so it is important that you understand them....\u00a0...We will start off with ....\u00a0 Polynomials in one variable are algebraic expressions that consist of terms in the form ...\u00a0where ... is a non-negative (... positive or zero) integer and ... is a real number and is called the ... of the term.\u00a0 The ... of a polynomial in one variable is the largest exponent in the polynomial....\u00a0...Note that we will often drop the \u201cin one variable\u201d part and just say polynomial....\u00a0...Here are examples of polynomials and their degrees....\u00a0...So, a polynomial doesn\u2019t have to contain all powers of ... as we see in the first example.\u00a0 Also, polynomials can consist of a single term as we see in the third and fifth example....\u00a0...We should probably discuss the final example a little more.\u00a0 This really is a polynomial even it may not look like one.\u00a0 Remember that a polynomial is any algebraic expression that consists of terms in the form ....\u00a0 Another way to write the last example is...Written in this way makes it clear that the exponent on the ... is a zero (this also explains the degree\u2026) and so we can see that it really is a polynomial in one variable....\u00a0...Here are some examples of things that aren\u2019t polynomials....\u00a0...The first one isn\u2019t a polynomial because it has a negative exponent and all exponents in a polynomial must be positive....\u00a0...To see why the second one isn\u2019t a polynomial let\u2019s rewrite it a little....By converting the root to exponent form we see that there is a rational root in the algebraic expression.\u00a0 All the exponents in the algebraic expression must be integers in order for the algebraic expression to be a polynomial.\u00a0 As a general rule of thumb if an algebraic expression has a radical in it then it isn\u2019t a polynomial....\u00a0...Let\u2019s also rewrite the third one to see why it isn\u2019t a polynomial....So, this algebraic expression really has a negative exponent in it and we know that isn\u2019t allowed.\u00a0 Another rule of thumb is if there are any variables in the denominator of a fraction then the algebraic expression isn\u2019t a polynomial....\u00a0...Note that this doesn\u2019t mean that radicals and fractions aren\u2019t allowed in polynomials.\u00a0 They just can\u2019t involve the variables.\u00a0 For instance, the following is a polynomial...There are lots of radicals and fractions in this algebraic expression, but the denominators of the fractions are only numbers and the radicands of each radical are only a numbers.\u00a0 Each ... in the algebraic expression appears in the numerator and the exponent is a positive (or zero) integer.\u00a0 Therefore this is a polynomial....\u00a0...Next, let\u2019s take a quick look at ....\u00a0 Polynomials in two variables are algebraic expressions consisting of terms in the form ....\u00a0 The degree of each term in a polynomial in two variables is the sum of the exponents in each term and the ... of the polynomial is the largest such sum....\u00a0...Here are some examples of polynomials in two variables and their degrees....\u00a0...In these kinds of polynomials not every term needs to have both ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s in them, in fact as we see in the last example they don\u2019t need to have any terms that contain both ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s.\u00a0 Also, the degree of the polynomial may come from terms involving only one variable.\u00a0 Note as well that multiple terms may have the same degree....\u00a0...We can also talk about polynomials in three variables, or four variables or as many variables as we need.\u00a0 The vast majority of the polynomials that we\u2019ll see in this course are polynomials in one variable and so most of the examples in the remainder of this section will be polynomials in one variable....\u00a0...Next we need to get some terminology out of the way.\u00a0 A ... is a polynomial that consists of exactly one term.\u00a0 A ... is a polynomial that consists of exactly two terms.\u00a0 Finally, a ... is a polynomial that consists of exactly three terms.\u00a0 We will use these terms off and on so you should probably be at least somewhat familiar with them....\u00a0...Now we need to talk about adding, subtracting and multiplying polynomials.\u00a0 You\u2019ll note that we left out division of polynomials.\u00a0 That will be discussed in a later ... where we will use division of polynomials quite often....\u00a0...Before actually starting this discussion we need to recall the distributive law.\u00a0 This will be used repeatedly in the remainder of this section.\u00a0 Here is the distributive law....\u00a0...\u00a0...We will start with adding and subtracting polynomials.\u00a0 This is probably best done with a couple of examples....\u00a0...Perform   the indicated operation for each of the following....Add   ...\u00a0to ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...Subtract   ...\u00a0from ....\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0... Add ...\u00a0to .......The first thing that we should do is actually write down   the operation that we are being asked to do....In this case the parenthesis are not required since we are   adding the two polynomials.\u00a0 They are   there simply to make clear the operation that we are performing.\u00a0 To add two polynomials all that we do is ....\u00a0 This means that for each term with the same   exponent we will add or subtract the coefficient of that term....\u00a0...In this case this is,... Subtract ...\u00a0from .......Again, let\u2019s write down the operation we are doing   here.\u00a0 We will also need to be very   careful with the order that we write things down in.\u00a0 Here is the operation...\u00a0...This time the parentheses around the second term are   absolutely required.\u00a0 We are   subtracting the whole polynomial and the parenthesis must be there to make   sure we are in fact subtracting the whole polynomial....\u00a0...In doing the subtraction the first thing that we\u2019ll do is ... through the   parenthesis.\u00a0 This means that we will   change the sign on every term in the second polynomial.\u00a0 Note that all we are really doing here is   multiplying a \u201c-1\u201d through the second polynomial using the distributive   law.\u00a0 After distributing the minus   through the parenthesis we again combine like terms....\u00a0...Here is the work for this problem....\u00a0...Note that sometimes a term will completely drop out after   combing like terms as the ... did   here.\u00a0 This will happen on occasion so   don\u2019t get excited about it when it does happen....\u00a0...Now let\u2019s move onto multiplying polynomials.\u00a0 Again, it\u2019s best to do these in an example....\u00a0...Multiply   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...This one is nothing more than a quick application of the distributive   law....\u00a0... ...This one will use the FOIL method for   multiplying these two binomials....\u00a0...Recall that the FOIL method will only work when   multiplying two binomials.\u00a0 If either   of the polynomials isn\u2019t a binomial then the FOIL method won\u2019t work....\u00a0...Also note that all we are really doing here is multiplying   every term in the second polynomial by every term in the first polynomial.\u00a0 The FOIL acronym is simply a convenient way   to remember this....\u00a0... ...Again we will just FOIL this one out....\u00a0... ...We can still FOIL binomials that involve more than one   variable so don\u2019t get excited about these kinds of problems when they arise.... ...In this case the FOIL method won\u2019t work since the second   polynomial isn\u2019t a binomial.\u00a0 Recall   however that the FOIL acronym was just a way to remember that we multiply   every term in the second polynomial by every term in the first polynomial....\u00a0...That is all that we need to do here....\u00a0...Let\u2019s work another set of examples that will illustrate some nice formulas for some special products.\u00a0 We will give the formulas after the example....\u00a0...Multiply   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...We can use FOIL on this one so let\u2019s do that....In this case the middle terms drop out....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Now recall that ....\u00a0 Squaring with polynomials works the same   way.\u00a0 So in this case we have,...\u00a0... ...This one is nearly identical to the previous part....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...This part is here to remind us that we need to be careful   with coefficients.\u00a0 When we\u2019ve got a   coefficient we MUST do the exponentiation first and then multiply the   coefficient....You can only multiply a coefficient through a set of   parenthesis if there is an exponent of \u201c1\u201d on the parenthesis.\u00a0 If there is any other exponent then you   CAN\u2019T multiply the coefficient through the parenthesis....\u00a0...Just to illustrate the point....\u00a0...This is clearly not the same as the correct answer so be   careful!...\u00a0...The parts of this example all use one of the following special products....\u00a0...Be careful to not make the following mistakes!...\u00a0...These are very common mistakes that students often make when they first start learning how to multiply polynomials.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Polynomials.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Polynomials", "subject": "math"}},

integer.\u00a0 Once we have this figured out the more general case given above will actually be pretty easy to deal with....\u00a0...Let\u2019s first define just what we mean by exponents of this

them directly.\u00a0 When first confronted   with these kinds of evaluations doing them directly is often very   difficult.\u00a0 In order to evaluate these   we will remember the equivalence given in the definition and use that   instead....\u00a0...We will work the first one in detail and then not put as   much detail into the rest of the problems....\u00a0... ...So, here is what we are asking in this problem....Using the equivalence from the definition we can rewrite   this as,...So, all that we are really asking here is what number did   we square to get 25.\u00a0 In this case that   is (hopefully) easy to get.\u00a0 We square   5 to get 25.\u00a0 Therefore,...\u00a0... ...So what we are asking here is what number did we raise to   the 5... power to get 32?...\u00a0... ...What number did we raise to the 4... power to   get 81?...\u00a0... ...We need to be a little careful with minus signs here, but   other than that it works the same way as the previous parts.\u00a0 What number did we raise to the 3...   power (... cube) to get -8?...\u00a0... ...This part does not have an answer.\u00a0 It is here to make a point.\u00a0 In this case we are asking what number do   we raise to the 4... power to get -16.\u00a0 However, we also know that raising any   number (positive or negative) to an even power will be positive.\u00a0 In other words, there is no real number   that we can raise to the 4... power to get -16....\u00a0...Note that this is different from the previous part.\u00a0 If we raise a negative number to an odd   power we will get a negative number so we could do the evaluation in the   previous part....\u00a0...As this part has shown, we can\u2019t always do these   evaluations....\u00a0... ...Again, this part is here to make a point more than   anything.\u00a0 Unlike the previous part   this one has an answer.\u00a0 Recall from   the previous section that if there aren\u2019t any parentheses then only the part   immediately to the left of the exponent gets the exponent.\u00a0 So, this part is really asking us to   evaluate the following term....So, we need to determine what number raised to the 4...   power will give us 16.\u00a0 This is 2 and   so in this case the answer is,...\u00a0...As the last two parts of the previous example has once again shown, we really need to be careful with parenthesis.\u00a0 In this case parenthesis makes the difference between being able to get an answer or not....\u00a0...Also, don\u2019t be worried if you didn\u2019t know some of these powers off the top of your head.\u00a0 They are usually fairly simple to determine if you don\u2019t know them right away.\u00a0 For instance in the part b we needed to determine what number raised to the 5 will give 32.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t see the power right off the top of your head simply start taking powers until you find the correct one.\u00a0 In other words compute ..., ..., ...\u00a0until you reach the correct value.\u00a0 Of course in this case we wouldn\u2019t need to go past the first computation....\u00a0...The next thing that we should acknowledge is that all of the ... that we gave in the previous section are still valid for all rational exponents.\u00a0 This includes the more general rational exponent that we haven\u2019t looked at yet....\u00a0...Now that we know that the properties are still valid we can see how to deal with the more general rational exponent.\u00a0 There are in fact two different ways of dealing with them as we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 Both methods involve using property 2 from the previous section.\u00a0 For reference purposes this property is,...\u00a0...So, let\u2019s see how to deal with a general rational exponent.\u00a0 We will first rewrite the exponent as follows....\u00a0...In other words we can think of the exponent as a product of two numbers.\u00a0 Now we will use the exponent property shown above.\u00a0 However, we will be using it in the opposite direction than what we did in the previous section.\u00a0 Also, there are two ways to do it.\u00a0 Here they are,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Using either of these forms we can now evaluate some more complicated expressions...\u00a0...Evaluate   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...We can use either form to do the evaluations.\u00a0 However, it is usually more convenient to   use the first form as we will see....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s use both forms here since neither one is too bad in   this case.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at the   first form....\u00a0...Now, let\u2019s take a look at the second form....\u00a0...So, we get the same answer regardless of the form.\u00a0 Notice however that when we used the second   form we ended up taking the 3... root of a much larger number which   can cause problems on occasion....\u00a0... ...Again, let\u2019s use both forms to compute this one....\u00a0...As this part has shown the second form can be quite   difficult to use in computations.\u00a0 The   root in this case was not an obvious root and not particularly easy to get if   you didn\u2019t know it right off the top of your head....\u00a0... ...In this case we\u2019ll only use the first form.\u00a0 However, before doing that we\u2019ll need to   first use ... of our   exponent properties to get the exponent onto the numerator and denominator....\u00a0...We can also do some of the simplification type problems with rational exponents that we saw in the previous section....\u00a0...Simplify   each of the following and write the answers with only positive exponents....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... For this problem we will first move the exponent into the   parenthesis then we will eliminate the negative exponent as we did in the   previous section.\u00a0 We will then move   the term to the denominator and drop the minus sign....\u00a0... In this case we will first simplify the expression inside the   parenthesis....\u00a0...Don\u2019t worry if, after simplification, we don\u2019t have a   fraction anymore.\u00a0 That will happen on   occasion.\u00a0 Now we will eliminate the   negative in the exponent using ... and then we\u2019ll use ...   to finish the problem up....\u00a0...We will leave this section with a warning about a common mistake that students make in regards to negative exponents and rational exponents.\u00a0 Be careful not to confuse the two as they are totally separate topics....\u00a0...In other words,...and NOT...\u00a0...This is a very common mistake when students first learn exponent rules.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/RationalExponents.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Rational Exponents", "subject": "math"}},

want the answer to be in....\u00a0...Note as well that many of these properties were given with only two terms/factors but they can be extended out to as many terms/factors as we need.\u00a0 For example, property 4 can be extended as follows....We only used four factors here, but hopefully you get the point.\u00a0 Property 4 (and most of the other properties) can be extended out to meet the number of factors that we have in a given problem....\u00a0...There are several common mistakes that students make with these properties the first time they see them.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of them....\u00a0...Consider the following case....In this case only the ... gets the exponent since it is immediately off to the left of the exponent and so only this term moves to the denominator.\u00a0 Do NOT carry the ... down to the denominator with the ....\u00a0 Contrast this with the following case....In this case the exponent is on the set of parenthesis and so we can just use property 7 on it and so both the ... and the ... move down to the denominator.\u00a0 Again, note the importance of parenthesis and how they can change an answer!...\u00a0...Here is another common mistake....In this case the exponent is only on the ... and so to use property 8 on this we would have to break up the fraction as shown and then use property 8 only on the second term.\u00a0 To bring the 3 up with the ... we would have needed the following....\u00a0...Once again, notice this common mistake comes down to being careful with parenthesis.\u00a0 This will be a constant refrain throughout these notes.\u00a0 We must always be careful with parenthesis.\u00a0 Misusing them can lead to incorrect answers....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some more complicated examples now....\u00a0...Simplify   each of the following and write the answers with only positive exponents....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...Note that when we say \u201csimplify\u201d in the problem statement   we mean that we will need to use all the properties that we can to get the   answer into the required form.\u00a0 Also, a   \u201csimplified\u201d answer will have as few terms as possible and each term should   have no more than a single exponent on it....\u00a0...There are many different paths that we can take to get to   the final answer for each of these.\u00a0 In   the end the answer will be the same regardless of the path that you used to   get the answer.\u00a0 All that this means   for you is that as long as you used the properties you can take the path that   you find the easiest.\u00a0 The path that   others find to be the easiest may not be the path that you find to be the   easiest.\u00a0 That is okay....\u00a0...Also, we won\u2019t put quite as much detail in using some of   these properties as we did in the examples given with each property.\u00a0 For instance, we won\u2019t show the actual   multiplications anymore, we will just give the result of the multiplication. ...\u00a0... ...For this one we will use property 10 first....Don\u2019t forget to put the exponent on the constant in this   problem.\u00a0 That is one of the more   common mistakes that students make with these simplification problems....\u00a0...At this point we need to evaluate the first term and   eliminate the negative exponent on the second term.\u00a0 The evaluation of the first term isn\u2019t too   bad and all we need to do to eliminate the negative exponent on the second   term is use the definition we gave for negative exponents....\u00a0...We further simplified our answer by combining everything   up into a single fraction.\u00a0 This should   always be done....\u00a0...The middle step in this part is usually skipped.\u00a0 All the definition of negative exponents   tells us to do is move the term to the denominator and drop the minus sign in   the exponent.\u00a0 So, from this point on,   that is what we will do without writing in the middle step....\u00a0 ...In this case we will first use property 10 on both terms   and then we will combine the terms using property 1.\u00a0 Finally, we will eliminate the negative   exponents using the definition of negative exponents....\u00a0...There are a couple of things to be careful with in this   problem.\u00a0 First, when using the   property 10 on the first term, make sure that you square the \u201c-10\u201d and not   just the 10 (... don\u2019t forget the   minus sign\u2026).\u00a0 Second, in the final   step, the 100 stays in the numerator since there is no negative exponent on   it.\u00a0 The exponent of \u201c-11\u201d is only on   the ... and so only the ... moves to the denominator....\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0 ...This one isn\u2019t too bad.\u00a0   We will use the definition of negative exponents to move all terms   with negative exponents in them to the denominator.\u00a0 Also, property 8 simply says that if there   is a term with a negative exponent in the denominator then we will just move   it to the numerator and drop the minus sign....\u00a0...So, let\u2019s take care of the negative exponents first....\u00a0...Now simplify.\u00a0 We   will use property 1 to combine the ...\u2019s   in the numerator.\u00a0 We will use property   3 to combine the ...\u2019s and since we   are looking for positive exponents we will use the first form of this   property since that will put a positive exponent up in the numerator....\u00a0...Again, the 7 will stay in the denominator since there   isn\u2019t a negative exponent on it.\u00a0 It   will NOT move up to the numerator with the ....\u00a0 Do not get excited if   all the terms move up to the numerator or if all the terms move down to the   denominator.\u00a0 That will happen on   occasion....\u00a0... ...This example is similar to the previous one except there   is a little more going on with this one.\u00a0   The first step will be to again, get rid of the negative exponents as   we did in the previous example.\u00a0 Any   terms in the numerator with negative exponents will get moved to the   denominator and we\u2019ll drop the minus sign in the exponent.\u00a0 Likewise, any terms in the denominator with   negative exponents will move to the numerator and we\u2019ll drop the minus sign   in the exponent.\u00a0 Notice this time,   unlike the previous part, there is a term with a set of parenthesis in the   denominator.\u00a0 Because of the   parenthesis that whole term, including the 3, will move to the numerator....\u00a0...Here is the work for this part....\u00a0...\u00a0... ...There are several first steps that we can take with this   one.\u00a0 The first step that we\u2019re pretty   much always going to take with these kinds of problems is to first simplify   the fraction inside the parenthesis as much as possible.\u00a0 After we do that we will use property 5 to   deal with the exponent that is on the parenthesis....\u00a0...In this case we used the second form of property 3 to   simplify the ...\u2019s since this put a   positive exponent in the denominator.\u00a0   Also note that we almost never write an exponent of \u201c1\u201d.\u00a0 When we have exponents of 1 we will drop   them....\u00a0 ...This one is very similar to the previous part.\u00a0 The main difference is negative on the   outer exponent.\u00a0 We will deal with that   once we\u2019ve simplified the fraction inside the parenthesis....Now at this point we can use property 6 to deal with the   exponent on the parenthesis.\u00a0 Doing   this gives us,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Before leaving this section we need to talk briefly about the requirement of positive only exponents in the above set of examples.\u00a0 This was done only so there would be a consistent final answer.\u00a0 In many cases negative exponents are okay and in some cases they are required.\u00a0 In fact, if you are on a track that will take you into calculus there are a fair number of problems in a calculus class in which negative exponents are the preferred, if not required, form.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/IntegerExponents.aspx", "media":

{"model": "openbar_search.Query", "fields": {"body": "Of all the topics covered in this chapter factoring polynomials is probably the most important topic.\u00a0 There are many sections in later chapters where the first step will be to factor a polynomial.\u00a0 So, if you can\u2019t factor the polynomial then you won\u2019t be able to even start the problem let alone finish it....\u00a0...Let\u2019s start out by talking a little bit about just what factoring is.\u00a0 Factoring is the process by which we go about determining what we multiplied to get the given quantity.\u00a0 We do this all the time with numbers.\u00a0 For instance, here are a variety of ways to factor 12....\u00a0...\u00a0...There are many more possible ways to factor 12, but these are representative of many of them.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...A common method of factoring numbers is to ... the number into positive prime factors.\u00a0 A ... number is a number whose only positive factors are 1 and itself.\u00a0 For example 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all examples of prime numbers.\u00a0 Examples of numbers that aren\u2019t prime are 4, 6, and 12 to pick a few....\u00a0...If we completely factor a number into positive prime factors there will only be one way of doing it.\u00a0 That is the reason for factoring things in this way.\u00a0 For our example above with 12 the complete factorization is,...\u00a0...Factoring polynomials is done in pretty much the same manner.\u00a0 We determine all the terms that were multiplied together to get the given polynomial.\u00a0 We then try to factor each of the terms we found in the first step.\u00a0 This continues until we simply can\u2019t factor anymore.\u00a0 When we can\u2019t do any more factoring we will say that the polynomial is ...\u00a0...Here are a couple of examples....This is completely factored since neither of the two factors on the right can be further factored....\u00a0...Likewise,...is not completely factored because the second factor can be further factored.\u00a0 Note that the first factor is completely factored however.\u00a0 Here is the complete factorization of this polynomial....\u00a0...The purpose of this section is to familiarize ourselves with many of the techniques for factoring polynomials....\u00a0...\u00a0...The first method for factoring polynomials will be factoring out the ....\u00a0 When factoring in general this will also be the first thing that we should try as it will often simplify the problem....\u00a0...To use this method all that we do is look at all the terms and determine if there is a factor that is in common to all the terms.\u00a0 If there is, we will factor it out of the polynomial.\u00a0 Also note that in this case we are really only using the distributive law in reverse.\u00a0 Remember that the distributive law states that...In factoring out the greatest common factor we do this in reverse.\u00a0 We notice that each term has an ... in it and so we \u201cfactor\u201d it out using the distributive law in reverse as follows,...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples....\u00a0...Factor   out the greatest common factor from each of the following polynomials....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...   ...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0 ...First we will notice that we can factor a 2 out of every   term.\u00a0 Also note that we can factor an ... out of every term.\u00a0 Here then is the factoring for this   problem....\u00a0...Note that we can always check our factoring by multiplying   the terms back out to make sure we get the original polynomial....\u00a0... ...In this case we have both ...\u2019s and ...\u2019s in the   terms but that doesn\u2019t change how the process works.\u00a0 Each term contains and ... and a ...   so we can factor both of those out.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...\u00a0... ...   ...In this case we can factor a 3... out of every term.\u00a0 Here   is the work for this one....Notice the \u201c+1\u201d where the 3... originally was in the final term, since the final term was the   term we factored out we needed to remind ourselves that there was a term   there originally.\u00a0 To do this we need   the \u201c+1\u201d and notice that it is \u201c+1\u201d instead of \u201c-1\u201d because the term was   originally a positive term.\u00a0 If it had   been a negative term originally we would have had to use \u201c-1\u201d.\u00a0 ...\u00a0...One of the more common mistakes with these types of   factoring problems is to forget this \u201c1\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0   Remember that we can always check by multiplying the two back out to   make sure we get the original.\u00a0 To   check that the \u201c+1\u201d is required, let\u2019s drop it and then multiply out to see   what we get....\u00a0...So, without the \u201c+1\u201d we don\u2019t get the original   polynomial!\u00a0 Be careful with this.\u00a0 It is easy to get in a hurry and forget to   add a \u201c+1\u201d or \u201c-1\u201d as required when factoring out a complete term....\u00a0... ...This one looks a little odd in comparison to the   others.\u00a0 However, it works the same   way.\u00a0 There is a 3... in each term and there is also a ...in each term and so that can also be   factored out.\u00a0 Doing the factoring for   this problem gives,...\u00a0...This is a method that isn\u2019t used all that often, but when it can be used it can be somewhat useful.\u00a0 This method is best illustrated with an example or two....\u00a0...Factor   by grouping each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...In this case we ...   the first two terms and the final two terms as shown here,...Now, notice that we can factor an ... out of the first grouping and a ... out of the second grouping.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...We can now see that we can factor out a common factor of ...\u00a0so let\u2019s do that to the final factored form....\u00a0...And we\u2019re done.\u00a0   That\u2019s all that there is to factoring by grouping.\u00a0 Note again that this will not always work   and sometimes the only way to know if it will work or not is to try it and   see what you get....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...   ...In this case we will do the same initial step, but this   time notice that both of the final two terms are negative so we\u2019ll factor out   a \u201c-\u201d as well when we group them.\u00a0   Doing this gives,...Again, we can always distribute the \u201c-\u201d back through the   parenthesis to make sure we get the original polynomial....\u00a0...At this point we can see that we can factor an ... out of the first term and a 2 out of   the second term.\u00a0 This gives,...We now have a common factor that we can factor out to   complete the problem....\u00a0... ...This one also has a \u201c-\u201d in front of the third term as we   saw in the last part.\u00a0 However, this   time the fourth term has a \u201c+\u201d in front of it unlike the last part.\u00a0 We will still factor a \u201c-\u201d out when we   group however to make sure that we don\u2019t lose track of it.\u00a0 When we factor the \u201c-\u201d out notice that we   needed to change the \u201c+\u201d on the fourth term to a \u201c-\u201d.\u00a0 Again, you can always check that this was   done correctly by multiplying the \u201c-\u201d back through the parenthsis....\u00a0...Now that we\u2019ve done a couple of these we won\u2019t put the   remaining details in and we\u2019ll go straight to the final factoring....\u00a0...\u00a0...Factoring by grouping can be nice, but it doesn\u2019t work all that often.\u00a0 Notice that as we saw in the last two parts of this example if there is a \u201c-\u201d in front of the third term we will often also factor that out of the third and fourth terms when we group them....\u00a0...First, let\u2019s note that quadratic is another term for second degree polynomial.\u00a0 So we know that the largest exponent in a quadratic polynomial will be a 2.\u00a0 In these problems we will be attempting to factor quadratic polynomials into two first degree (hence forth linear) polynomials.\u00a0 Until you become good at these, we usually end up doing these by trial and error although there are a couple of processes that can make them somewhat easier....\u00a0...Let\u2019s take a look at some examples....\u00a0...Factor   each of the following polynomials....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0...\u00a0... ...Okay since the first term is ... we know that the factoring must take the form....We know that it will take this form because when we   multiply the two linear terms the first term must be ... and the only way to get that to show up is to   multiply ... by ....\u00a0 Therefore, the first   term in each factor must be an ....\u00a0 To finish this we just need to determine   the two numbers that need to go in the blank spots....\u00a0...We can narrow down the possibilities considerably.\u00a0 Upon multiplying the two factors out these   two numbers will need to multiply out to get -15.\u00a0 In other words these two numbers must be factors   of -15.\u00a0 Here are all the possible ways   to factor -15 using only integers....\u00a0...Now, we can just plug these in one after another and   multiply out until we get the correct pair.\u00a0   However, there is another trick that we can use here to help us   out.\u00a0 The correct pair of numbers must   add to get the coefficient of the ...   term.\u00a0 So, in this case the third pair   of factors will add to \u201c+2\u201d and so that is the pair we are after....\u00a0...Here is the factored form of the polynomial....\u00a0...Again, we can always check that we got the correct answer by doing a quick multiplication....\u00a0...Note that the method we used here will only work if the   coefficient of the ...   term is one.\u00a0 If it is anything else   this won\u2019t work and we really will be back to trial and error to get the   correct factoring form....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s write down the initial form again,...Now, we need two numbers that multiply to get 24 and add   to get -10.\u00a0 It looks like -6 and -4   will do the trick and so the factored form of this polynomial is,...\u00a0... ...Again, let\u2019s start with the initial form,...This time we need two numbers that multiply to get 9 and   add to get 6.\u00a0 In this case 3 and 3   will be the correct pair of numbers.\u00a0   Don\u2019t forget that the two numbers can be the same number on occasion   as they are here....\u00a0...Here is the factored form for this polynomial....\u00a0...Note as well that we further simplified the factoring to   acknowledge that it is a perfect square.\u00a0   You should always do this when it happens....\u00a0... ...Once again, here is the initial form,...Okay, this time we need two numbers that multiply to get 1   and add to get 5.\u00a0 There aren\u2019t two   integers that will do this and so this quadratic doesn\u2019t factor....\u00a0...This will happen on occasion so don\u2019t get excited about it   when it does....\u00a0... ...Okay, we no longer have a coefficient of 1 on the ... term.\u00a0 However we can still make a guess as to the   initial form of the factoring.\u00a0 Since   the coefficient of the ...   term is a 3 and there are only two positive factors of 3 there is really only   one possibility for the initial form of the factoring....\u00a0...Since the only way to get a 3... is to multiply a 3... and an ... these must   be the first two terms.\u00a0 However,   finding the numbers for the two blanks will not be as easy as the previous   examples.\u00a0 We will need to start off   with all the factors of -8....\u00a0...At this point the only option is to pick a pair plug them   in and see what happens when we multiply the terms out.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the fourth pair.\u00a0 Let\u2019s plug the numbers in and see what we   get....Well the first and last terms are correct, but then they   should be since we\u2019ve picked numbers to make sure those work out   correctly.\u00a0 However, since the middle   term isn\u2019t correct this isn\u2019t the correct factoring of the polynomial....\u00a0...That doesn\u2019t mean that we guessed wrong however.\u00a0 With the previous parts of this example it   didn\u2019t matter which blank got which number.\u00a0   This time it does.\u00a0 Let\u2019s flip   the order and see what we get....\u00a0...So, we got it.\u00a0 We   did guess correctly the first time we just put them into the wrong spot....\u00a0...So, in these problems don\u2019t forget to check both places   for each pair to see if either will work....\u00a0... ...Again the coefficient of the ... term has only two positive factors so we\u2019ve only   got one possible initial form....Next we need all the factors of 6.\u00a0 Here they are....Don\u2019t forget the negative factors.\u00a0 They are often the ones that we want.\u00a0 In fact, upon noticing that the coefficient   of the ... is negative we can be   assured that we will need one of the two pairs of negative factors since that   will be the only way we will get\u00a0   negative coefficient there.\u00a0   With some trial and error we can get that the factoring of this   polynomial is,...\u00a0... ...In this final step we\u2019ve got a harder problem here.\u00a0 The coefficient of the ... term now has more than one pair of positive   factors.\u00a0 This means that the initial   form must be one of the following possibilities....\u00a0...To fill in the blanks we will need all the factors of   -6.\u00a0 Here they are,...\u00a0...With some trial and error we can find that the correct   factoring of this polynomial is,...\u00a0...Note as well that in the trial and error phase we need to   make sure and plug each pair into both possible forms and in both possible   orderings to correctly determine if it is the correct pair of factors or not....\u00a0...We can actually go one more step here and factor a 2 out   of the second term if we\u2019d like to.\u00a0   This gives,...\u00a0...This is important because we could also have factored this   as,...which, on the surface, appears to be different from the   first form given above.\u00a0 However, in   this case we can factor a 2 out of the first term to get,...\u00a0...This is exactly what we got the first time and so we   really do have the same factored form of this polynomial....\u00a0...There are some nice special forms of some polynomials that can make factoring easier for us on occasion.\u00a0 Here are the special forms....\u00a0...\u00a0...Let\u2019s work some examples with these....\u00a0...Factor   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...In this case we\u2019ve got three terms and it\u2019s a quadratic   polynomial.\u00a0 Notice as well that the   constant is a perfect square and its square root is 10.\u00a0 Notice as well that 2(10)=20 and this is   the coefficient of the ... term.\u00a0 So, it looks like we\u2019ve got the second   special form above.\u00a0 The correct   factoring of this polynomial is,...\u00a0...To be honest, it might have been easier to just use the   general process for factoring quadratic polynomials in this case rather than   checking that it was one of the special forms, but we did need to see one of   them worked....\u00a0... ...In this case all that we need to notice is that we\u2019ve got   a difference of perfect squares,...So, this must be the third special form above.\u00a0 Here is the correct factoring for this   polynomial.... ...This problem is the sum of two perfect cubes,...and so we know that it is the fourth special form from   above.\u00a0 Here is the factoring for this   polynomial....\u00a0...Do not make the following factoring mistake!...This just simply isn\u2019t true for the vast majority of sums of squares, so be careful not to make this very common mistake.  There are rare cases where this can be done, but none of those special cases will be seen here....\u00a0...There is no one method for doing these in general.\u00a0 However, there are some that we can do so let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples....\u00a0...Factor   each of the following....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ...In this case let\u2019s notice that we can factor out a common   factor of 3... from all   the terms so let\u2019s do that first....What is left is a quadratic that we can use the techniques   from above to factor.\u00a0 Doing this gives   us,...\u00a0...Don\u2019t forget that the ...   step to factoring should always be to factor out the greatest common   factor.\u00a0 This can only help the   process....\u00a0... ...There is no greatest common factor here.\u00a0 However, notice that this is the difference   of two perfect squares....So, we can use the third special form from above....\u00a0...Neither of these can be further factored and so we are   done.\u00a0 Note however, that often we will   need to do some further factoring at this stage....\u00a0... ...Let\u2019s start this off by working a factoring a different   polynomial....We used a different variable here since we\u2019d already used ...\u2019s for the original polynomial....\u00a0...So, why did we work this?\u00a0   Well notice that if we let ...\u00a0then ....\u00a0 We can then rewrite the original polynomial   in terms of ...\u2019s as follows,...and we know how to factor this!\u00a0 So factor the polynomial in ...\u2019s then back substitute using the   fact that we know .......\u00a0...\u00a0...Finally, notice that the first term will also factor since   it is the difference of two perfect squares.\u00a0   The correct factoring of this polynomial is then,...\u00a0...\u00a0...Note that this converting to ... first can be useful on occasion, however once you get used to   these this is usually done in our heads....\u00a0...We did not do a lot of problems here and we didn\u2019t cover all the possibilities.\u00a0 However, we did cover some of the most common techniques that we are liable to run into in the other chapters of this work.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Factoring.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Factoring Polynomials", "subject": "math"}},

These are together to make a point about the importance of   the index in this notation.\u00a0 Let\u2019s take   a look at both of these....\u00a0...\u00a0...So, the index is important.\u00a0 Different indexes will give different   evaluations so make sure that you don\u2019t drop the index unless it is a 2 (and   hence we\u2019re using square roots)....\u00a0... ...\u00a0... ...\u00a0... ...\u00a0... ...As we saw in the integer exponent section this does not   have a real answer and so we can\u2019t evaluate the radical of a negative number   if the index is even.\u00a0 Note however   that we can evaluate the radical of a negative number if the index is odd as   the previous part shows....\u00a0...Let\u2019s briefly discuss the answer to the first part in the above example.\u00a0 In this part we made the claim that ...\u00a0because ....\u00a0 However, 4 isn\u2019t the only number that we can square to get 16.\u00a0 We also have ....\u00a0 So, why didn\u2019t we use -4 instead?\u00a0 There is a general rule about evaluating square roots (or more generally radicals with even indexes).\u00a0 When evaluating square roots we ALWAYS take the positive answer.\u00a0 If we want the negative answer we will do the following....\u00a0...This may not seem to be all that important, but in later topics this can be very important.\u00a0 Following this convention means that we will always get predictable values when evaluating roots....\u00a0...Note that we don\u2019t have a similar rule for radicals with odd indexes such as the cube root in part (d) above.\u00a0 This is because there will never be more than one possible answer for a radical with an odd index....\u00a0...We can also write the general rational exponent in terms of radicals as follows....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ...\u00a0...We now need to talk about some properties of radicals....\u00a0...If ... is a   positive integer greater than 1 and both ...   and ... are positive real numbers   then,...\u00a0...Note that on occasion we can allow ... or ... to be negative and still have these properties work.\u00a0 When we run across those situations we will acknowledge them.\u00a0 However, for the remainder of this section we will assume that ... and ... must be positive....\u00a0...Also note that while we can \u201cbreak up\u201d products and quotients under a radical we can\u2019t do the same thing for sums or differences.\u00a0 In other words,...\u00a0...If you aren\u2019t sure that you believe this consider the following quick number example....If we \u201cbreak up\u201d the root into the sum of the two pieces we clearly get different answers!\u00a0 So, be careful to not make this very common mistake!...\u00a0...We are going to be simplifying radicals shortly so we should next define ....\u00a0 A radical is said to be in simplified radical form (or just simplified form) if each of the following are true....\u00a0...\u00a0...In our first set of simplification examples we will only look at the first two.\u00a0 We will need to do a little more work before we can deal with the last two....\u00a0...Simplify   each of the following.

Assume that ... is positive....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...In all of these problems all we need to do is recall how   to FOIL binomials.\u00a0 Recall,...\u00a0...With radicals we multiply in exactly the same manner.\u00a0 The main difference is that on occasion   we\u2019ll need to do some simplification after doing the multiplication...\u00a0... ...\u00a0...As noted above we did need to do a little simplification   on the first term after doing the multiplication....\u00a0... ...Don\u2019t get excited about the fact that there are two   variables here.\u00a0 It works the same way!...\u00a0...Again, notice that we combined up the terms with two   radicals in them....\u00a0... ...Not much to do with this one....Notice that, in this case, the answer has no   radicals.\u00a0 That will happen on occasion   so don\u2019t get excited about it when it happens....\u00a0...The last part of the previous example really used the fact that...If you don\u2019t recall this formula we will look at it in a little more detail in the next section....\u00a0...Okay, we are now ready to take a look at some simplification examples illustrating the final two rules.\u00a0 Note as well that the fourth rule says that we shouldn\u2019t have any radicals in the denominator.\u00a0 To get rid of them we will use some of the multiplication ideas that we looked at above and the process of getting rid of the radicals in the denominator is called ....\u00a0 In fact, that is really what this next set of examples is about.\u00a0 They are really more examples of rationalizing the denominator rather than simplification examples....\u00a0...Rationalize   the denominator for each of the following.  Assume that ... is positive....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...There are really two different types of problems that   we\u2019ll be seeing here.\u00a0 The first two   parts illustrate the first type of problem and the final two parts illustrate   the second type of problem.\u00a0 Both types   are worked differently....\u00a0... ...In this case we are going to make use of the fact that ....\u00a0 We need to determine what to multiply the   denominator by so that this will show up in the denominator.\u00a0 Once we figure this out we will multiply   the numerator and denominator by this term....\u00a0...Here is the work for this part....\u00a0...Remember that if we multiply the denominator by a term we   must also multiply the numerator by the same term.\u00a0 In this way we are really multiplying the   term by 1 (since ...) and so aren\u2019t changing its value in   any way....\u00a0... ...We\u2019ll need to start this one off with first using the   third property of radicals to eliminate the fraction from underneath the   radical as is required for simplification....\u00a0...Now, in order to get rid of the radical in the denominator   we need the exponent on the ...to be   a 5.\u00a0 This means that we need to   multiply by ...\u00a0so let\u2019s do that....\u00a0... ...In this case we can\u2019t do the same thing that we did in the   previous two parts.\u00a0 To do this one we   will need to instead to make use of the fact that ...\u00a0...When the denominator consists of two terms with at least   one of the terms involving a radical we will do the following to get rid of   the radical....\u00a0...So, we took the original denominator and changed the sign   on the second term and multiplied the numerator and denominator by this new   term.\u00a0 By doing this we were able to   eliminate the radical in the denominator when we then multiplied out....\u00a0...\u00a0 ...This one works exactly the same as the previous   example.\u00a0 The only difference is that   both terms in the denominator now have radicals.\u00a0 The process is the same however....\u00a0...Rationalizing the denominator may seem to have no real uses and to be honest we won\u2019t see many uses in an Algebra class.\u00a0 However, if you are on a track that will take you into a Calculus class you will find that rationalizing is useful on occasion at that level....\u00a0...We will close out this section with a more general version of the first property of radicals.\u00a0 Recall that when we first wrote down the properties of radicals we required that ... be a positive number.\u00a0 This was done to make the work in this section a little easier.\u00a0 However, with the first property that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be the case....\u00a0...Here is the property for a general ... (... positive or negative)...\u00a0...\u00a0...where ...\u00a0is the absolute value of ....\u00a0 If you don\u2019t recall absolute value we will cover that in detail in a ... in the next chapter.\u00a0 All that you need to do is know at this point is that absolute value always makes ... a positive number....\u00a0...So, as a quick example this means that,...\u00a0...For square roots this is,...\u00a0...This will not be something we need to worry all that much about here, but again there are topics in courses after an Algebra course for which this is an important idea so we needed to at least acknowledge it.", "url": "http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Radicals.aspx", "media": "text", "title": "Pauls Online Notes : Algebra - Radicals", "subject": "math"}},
